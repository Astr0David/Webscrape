On his head, he wears a yellow and brown striped bandanna and over it is a tricorn captain's hat with what appears to be his Jolly Roger on it, a white skull wearing an animal-like hood. He also wears a dark blue, open shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a ruffled collar, and elaborate earrings made up by three little jewels each on both ears.", "personality": "Not much is known about A O's personality other than that he is very loyal to Whitebeard since he was willing to risk his own life to save Ace from execution instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his power. He was overjoyed when Luffy saved Ace, cheering with his fellow allies.", "abilities_and_powers": "A O is a fearsome pirate who has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the New World, becoming Whitebeard's subordinate."},
{"name": "Arlong", "episode": "Episode 69", "chapter": "Chapter 31", "year": 1999, "note": "", "appearance": "Arlong is a large, muscular, light blue saw-shark fish-man whose most distinctive trait is his saw-shaped nose. He has long, black hair reaching down to his shoulders and with a widow's peak. On his head, he wears a brown ushanka. He has a fin on his nape, surrounded by his hair, and his gills are located on both sides of his neck. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the left side of his chest, while his own Jolly Roger is on his left forearm. Other notable features include thin, fierce light-blue eyes and a long, angular jaw. Arlong's attire is composed of fashionable, light clothes, reflecting his rich status as well as his background as a thug. He wears a short-sleeved, unbuttoned yellow cabana shirt decorated by many black lightning-like spots, Bermuda shorts which are brown in the manga and green in the anime, a purple sash around the waist, and simple sandals. He also sports a lot of jewels: he has a golden chain bracelet around his left wrist and two golden bracelets around each ankle, with straw-like decorations hanging from them. On his hands are what appear to be rings, decorated by colorful gems. However, according to Oda in response to a fan about these rings, these aren't rings at all, but piercings that go straight through Arlong's fingers, as his hands are webbed and are incapable of wearing rings. As a member of the Sun Pirates, he wore an A-shirt, sometimes changed to a sleeveless, unbuttoned shirt decorated by flower-like motifs. He also wore a bowler hat and loose pants reaching down below his knees, first a light-colored pair with a line of similarly light spots on each leg's inner part, and later a similar pair, but darker in color and with spots on both sides of the legs. He already sported the straw decorations around his ankles and the sandals, and also donned a pair of large circular earrings. During his first raid on the Conomi Islands, he had a long, light green scarf hanging from his shoulders, a dark green coat, and a pair of beige Bermuda shorts with a chain-like pattern on them paired with a green sash around his waist. Also, instead of the ushanka he currently wears, he had a simple, dark grey hat on his head.", "personality": "Arlong considers humans to be inferior beings and is very cruel to them. He thinks nothing of killing a town full of humans, although he seems to prefer controlling people with money and deals (like Nami and Nezumi). Because of his love for money, he is known to be very cheap, as Hyouzou refused to join his crew because Arlong refused to compensate him for his service. He does not seem frightened by anything, and his fish-man strength made him extremely confident that he and his crew were virtually invincible. After Marine Captain Nezumi rejected his invitation for a drink out of fear of being seen in Arlong Park, Arlong simply offered to kill anyone who dared report him. He has an eye for spotting exploitable talent that he can use for his ambitions and is an excellent planner. He spent eight years using Nami and her maps to plan his conquest of the East Blue. Nevertheless, any promise about money he makes, he keeps. The best example is when his crew urged him to keep Nami even if she gathered 100,000,000. However, even though Arlong states he cannot go back on his word, he has no qualms about exploiting loopholes in his deals to get his way unfairly. He said he would free Nami's village if she brought him 100,000,000, but was more than willing to cheat her by having corrupt Marines confiscate her money to keep her in his services. He gets angry rather easily, as he nearly went on a rampage after being attacked by Usopp and had to be dragged back to his base by his crew to prevent him from destroying Cocoyasi Village. During his fight with Luffy, the boy's constant fighting back made Arlong deeply angry. Arlong had expected Luffy to die quickly, but his anger made him reckless and destructive, causing him to seriously damage his own headquarters and map collection while attacking Luffy. He has been ill-tempered since his younger years. However, he was not always entirely brutal. During a battle with the Marines, Arlong told Jinbe to leave the unconscious Marines alone. However, he became more arrogant over time, to the point that he completely lost any sympathy for humans. The circumstances behind Fisher Tiger's death led to his hatred of the human race greatly intensifying. He also failed to understand Tiger's reason for letting humans that they attacked live. As a result, when Arlong led his own crew and committed murder, humans came to view him as a monster. In the end, he enslaved humans just as the humans once enslaved many fish-men. Though his opinions and ideals were extreme, he displayed a high level of brotherhood with his crew and even towards Nami despite the divide between their species. Arlong looked after his subordinates, and even though he betrayed Nami, he did so because he did not want to lose her talent. On top of this, in the final moments of the battle with Luffy, he stated that Nami was his crewmate and would be forever, and while he never displayed any regard for her as a friend, he was prepared to fight to keep her in the crew. If humans insulted their group, Arlong would become enraged, resulting in officers attempting to keep his temper under control. When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek revenge on those responsible. He cared for his crew to a level that when Luffy used one of them as a shield, Arlong became extremely angry. Ironically, Arlong is a hypocrite, having accused Koala of being raised to look down on fish-men and think of humans as better than everyone else, when Arlong looked down on humans and preached fish-men superiority himself, making him no better than the humans. According to Hatchan, despite his hatred of humanity, Arlong would never harm his fellow fish-men no matter the circumstance. For all his talk about how Fish-men were the superior race and his own strength, Arlong was nothing more than a coward. After suffering a brutal defeat at the hands of Vice Admiral Borsalino and later Jinbe, Arlong, knowing he's no match in the Grand Line, fled to the East Blue, the weakest of the seas to set up his organization there to ensure he would never lose again. He lazily never bothered to train himself and just bullied Nami and her people to make himself feel superior and bribed the Marines to ensure Jinbe never found out solely to take the easy way out of not dealing with another defeat from Jinbe. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Shahahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Arlong Pirates, Arlong had full authority over his crew. His power was remarked to be greater than Don Krieg, the strongest military force in the East Blue, with only Krieg's military might and massive armada forcing the Marines to deem him the bigger threat. Arlong was not intimidated by Luffy's Devil Fruit powers and quickly took advantage of his weakness to the effects of the sea. With the Marines focusing their attention on the Grand Line and the incapacitation of all other major East Blue pirate bands by the Straw Hats, there would have been nothing to stop them from taking over East Blue if the Straw Hat Pirates had not intervened."},

He wears a blue vest over a brown garment that bears a kanji character (this is \"\" in the manga, but appears to be \"\" in his concept art.) At the bottom of his brown garment, there appear to be some sort of circular ornaments or designs. He also seems to have fairly sharp claws.", "personality": "It can be deduced from his willingness to put his life on the line to save Ace that Arthur is a person that values loyalty and friendship. Furthermore, since he was willing to take up arms against Marine Headquarters, it can be concluded that Arthur does not lack in bravery.", "abilities_and_powers": "Arthur is a fearsome pirate who has managed to achieve an infamous reputation in the New World."},

{"name": "Ashura Doji", "episode": "Episode 920", "chapter": "Chapter 910", "year": 2018, "note": "He was first mentioned as \"Shutenmaru\" by Holed'em in Chapter 916.", "appearance": "Ashura Doji was a very large man with light pink puffy hair that was gathered into a topknot. He wore an open kimono with flowers on it that left his chest exposed. He had floral tattoos on his arms and upper chest.", "personality": "Ashura was once an extremely violent and dangerous outlaw. He claimed that he hated people with a higher status than him. After being defeated by Kozuki Oden, who chose to spare his life and offered him a chance to live a peaceful life by rebuilding Kuri, Ashura became one of his most loyal followers out of immense gratitude. He and the other Nine Red Scabbards attempted to steal money from Shimotsuki Yasuie to support Oden. Ashura was even willing to study hard to improve himself on Oden's behalf. Ashura was an extremely loyal person, as he referred to Oden as \"Oden-sama\" even after his death. His dedication was also seen when he patiently tried to assemble an army of samurai to support the Kozuki Family and continued to believe in Toki's prophecy ten years after her death. He was also courageous and almost fearless. When he encountered Jack in Okobore Town, the then ruler of Kuri and one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars, the former was not afraid to attack the latter immediately and did not even fear Jack's reputation. However, he was cautious of Kaidou's strength, but he would have fought back against him if only to create an opening for his escape. Ashura was also a very caring person. When the samurai he had gathered tried to attack Kaidou at Onigashima, he cried and tried to stop them, but his words were in vain because they did not listen. After losing the last of his comrades, Ashura finally lost hope and returned to being a criminal under the alias Shutenmaru and formed a group of thieves because he was disillusioned and nihilistic towards the state of the country. After returning to being a criminal, he became an aggressive and prideful person. He stole from both Wano's wealthiest and poorest citizens for the same self-sufficiency motives. He also did not care what would happen to his country due to the lack of strong and noble people like Oden. As such, Ashura was disgusted with Luffy's heroism in feeding the citizens of Okobore Town. He also initially refused to rejoin the Kozuki Family after they returned for their campaign to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, accusing them of abandoning Wano Country. Ironically, his cynicism was what prevent him from falling into Kanjuros scheme into believing the fake Oden even though he wished it was him. Despite his callous behavior and nihilism towards the citizens of Wano, Ashura still had some compassion, as he secretly felt sympathy towards the citizens of Ebisu Town, who had lost the ability to express sadness and anger from eating the SMILEs that Orochi manipulated them into eating. He was also distraught when Yasuie was executed, showing that he still cared greatly for those that were his comrades. After deciding to rejoin the Nine Red Scabbards, Ashura became friendly with his comrades again, though he still bickered with them from time to time. He ultimately chose to sacrifice himself to prevent Kanjuro's explosives from killing the other Scabbards. Ashura was one of the few samurai known to still use Sunacchi, which was once part of the old dialect of Kuri in Wano Country. Ashura and his men used it frequently amongst themselves and in battle. Ashura seemed to enjoy drinking alcohol. In the past, he also drank blood from a decapitated snake.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Mt. Atama Thieves, Ashura Doji had complete authority over the group. He had excellent leadership skills, as he successfully led his bandits on missions to raid Orochi's Paradise Farm multiple times, though his group eventually came under suspicion. 25 years ago, while Oden was away with the Whitebeard Pirates, Ashura assumed control of the yakuza in Kuri as the new yakuza boss, and kept both the yakuza and bandits in the region from going out of control. Combat-wise, Ashura was a mighty samurai, once feared as the \"Strongest Monster of Kuri\" (, Kuri Saiky no Kaibutsu?)the most dangerous villain frequenting said region during its era of chaosuntil he was defeated by Oden four decades ago (the latter taking a whole night to take down both Ashura and his then-cohorts). Even more, in the last 20 years, Ashura claims to have become stronger. Kin'emon hailed Ashura as one of the strongest Scabbards (alongside Kawamatsu and Denjiro) and worth 100 men in battle. Kaidou himself, an Emperor, sought to recruit him and Holed'em, a Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, surmised that Monkey D. Luffy must have been Ashura's subordinate going by his power. Perhaps most impressively, Ashura was able to fight evenly against the All-Star Jack, a top henchman of Kaidou with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, even dealing him a severe wound, and fought evenly with Inuarashi, one of the two strongest warriors of the Mink Tribe, in a sparring match. However, Ashura was well aware that he had no chance against Kaidou by himself, preferring to retreat when faced with him a second time. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his dragon form."},
{"name": "Aruyutayan V", "episode": "Episode 292", "chapter": "Chapter 189", "year": 2003, "note": "His name was revealed in Vivre Card.", "appearance": "Aruyutayan was an old man with white shaggy, shoulder-length gray hair and a long gray beard. He has a large nose and thin, black eyebrows. He wears a large, golden crown that has a maroon cap and a purple band studded with turquoise. He also wears a purple shirt, a magenta cap with a fluffy white collar, and jewelry around his neck. In the anime, he wears a pink neckerchief instead.", "personality": "Aruyutayan was a greedy and selfish king who was not above making rash decisions if it resulted in personal gains. He was ignorant to the challenges of seafaring, refusing to bring along Noland's experienced crew in favor of his kingdom's army, who otherwise had little experience at sea. Aruyutayan was also seemingly unfazed by losing most of his soldiers on the voyage, being driven primarily by his materialistic desires for Shandora. When he was denied the city he so much craved for, Aruyutayan was quick to think Noland had tricked him in spite of the latter's credibility as a hero and famous explorer. A major egocentric, Aruyutayan did not tolerate being made a fool of, using his authority as a royal to order not only Noland's execution, but also to carry out a post-mortem smear campaign that would lead to Noland's legacy being twisted into that of a goofy liar. Aruyutayan went as far as planting a fake witness to trick his subjects into despising the otherwise beloved Noland.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king of Lvneel Kingdom, Aruyutayan had command of its soldiers and the admiral Mont Blanc Noland."},
{"name": "Aramaki", "episode": "Episode 905", "chapter": "Chapter 882", "year": 2018, "note": "His alias, Ryokugyu, was first mentioned by Donquixote Doflamingo in Chapter 713. His real name was revealed in Chapter 1053.", "appearance": "Ryokugyu is a muscular man with thick and wild dark hair which reaches to his neck. He appears to be quite tall, as he looked comparable to fellow admiral Fujitora who stands at 2.7 meters. On his face, he has a somewhat pronounced nose and lips as well as a light goatee and sideburns; he has been shown smoking a cigarette. Ryokugyu does not wear a shirt, whereby exposing a large kanji tattoo \"\" (meaning \"double suicide at death river\"?) running down the left side of his chest. He wears a pair of dark-colored pants with light flower designs on the left leg, whereas the right leg has a few small tears. Additionally, he wears the standard Marine coat cape draped on his shoulders, which covers his otherwise bare back as well as a pair of sunglasses over his eyes.", "personality": "Ryokugyu is shown to act in a casual and uncouth manner, being unafraid of expressing his mind. With friends and allies, he has been shown to act quite jovial and conversational, as seen by his talk with fellow admiral Fujitora. With enemies, however, Ryokugyu has expressed open contempt much like his direct superior Sakazuki, whom he wishes to emulate out of admiration. Ryokugyu agrees with Sakazuki's principle of never holding back when battling enemies and is very much a follower of Absolute Justice. His Justice motto, accordingly, is called \"Determined Justice\" (, Shinuki no Seigi?). Ryokugyu has shown to be far more fanatical in his devotion to the World Government compared to the other admirals and even Sakazuki, believing that the World Nobles are gods. His worldview is that society functions best with a strict hierarchy system where those in power can act however they please against those deemed inferior. Thus, he believes he can do whatever he wants against countries unaffiliated with the World Government, up to and including genocide to fulfill its purpose. He has been seen expressing anger at people who unleash chaos in the world and make life difficult for the Marines, which has led to him developing a grudge against Monkey D. Luffy. Despite his loyalty, however, Ryokugyu is also extremely self-willed and will disregard or outright defy orders from his superiors in favor of doing what he feels is best. Although he admires Sakazuki, he did not follow the fleet admiral's order to remove Fujitora from Mary Geoise, seeing no point in the two of them doing battle. Later, despite Sakazuki telling the Marines to avoid Wano following Kaidou and Big Mom's downfall, Ryokugyu went to the country anyway to take down Luffy because he believed he could accomplish this and that he would gain Sakazuki's approval by killing the pirate. Ryokugyu even personally called in a battleship to aid him in his unapproved attack on Wano, an action which no other admiral has been shown doing for a personal mission. If he is doing something he should not be and is questioned about it, he has been shown to give vague answers to avoid being reprimanded, and when talking to subordinates he will order them to not inform his superiors about what he is doing. In combat, he is ruthless with great confidence in his own abilities, taking pride in his title of admiral and his Devil Fruit, to the point of despising those he easily defeats and believing himself to be invincible for being \"nature itself\". This is shown when he impaled many of the Beasts Pirates in a gruesome manner during his attack on them and kicked Queen several times after impaling him while mocking him and King in the process, referring to them as \"simple\" emperor commanders as they tried to resist, and adding that he would lose face if he was defeated. During his battle against the Red Scabbards, he pretended to feel pain from Raizo's attack only to taunt him and dehydrate him. This led to Momonosuke destroying his body shortly after, though he continued to taunt him. Ryokugyu does at least acknowledge the strength of his enemies (albeit in a begrudging fashion), stating that Kaidou's mere presence alone was enough to keep him and other enemies from attacking Wano, as well as stopping his assault on Momonosuke's group and leaving Wano after Shanks had attacked him with a burst of Haoshoku Haki from outside of Wano. Ryokugyu has abstained from eating for the last three years for unknown reasons. He also enjoys being around beautiful women and remarked to Fujitora that he would consider breaking his fast if an attractive woman were to feed him. Like many other characters, Ryokugyu laughs in a unique fashion: \"Rahaha\" (, Rahaha?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Ryokugyu's authority in the Marines is directly below the fleet admiral's, commanding authority over all lower-ranked personnel. He can command whole fleets, has a say in the overall strategy of the organization, and possesses the ability to issue special orders, like enacting a Buster Call at any time, while also granting those of lower status such an ability. In general, Ryokugyu can be assumed to hold a great deal of military leadership/coordination skills to be seen as qualified for his rank and the responsibilities that come with it. In battle, Ryokugyu, along with the other admirals, are thought to constitute the World Government's \"Greatest Military Power\" (i.e., the strongest individual fighters that the government can bring into action), making Ryokugyu one of the world's most powerful combatants. Both he and Fujitora were stated by Doflamingo to be known as powerful monsters among the Marines. Ryokugyu effortlessly defeated King and Queen, two All-Stars of the Beasts Pirates with bounties of over 1,000,000,000, and several of their subordinates. However, it is possible that the pirates had not fully recovered from the injuries they sustained during the Udon prison breakout and the Raid on Onigashima that had happened days earlier. Ryokugyu was able to single-handedly contend with a group consisting of Raizo, Shinobu, Inuarashi, Denjiro, Nekomamushi, Kawamatsu, Yamato, and Kozuki Momonosuke and held the advantage over them until the latter gained better control of his Devil Fruit powers. Another testament of Ryokugyu's power is that he defeated and arrested Edward Weevil, a powerful former Warlord. Ryokugyu possesses a strong will, being able to remain conscious after taking a powerful burst of Shanks' Haoshoku Haki from outside of Wano."},

When he was still a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, Andre used to wear overalls over a collared shirt.", "personality": "Andre has great respect towards Whitebeard, as he was willing to put his own life on the line torescue Acefrom execution. This shows that he values loyalty and friendship, such to the point that he believed that friendship was more important than his own life.

Her clothes consist of a blue corset bordered with yellow and studded with buttons, a similar blue bikini bottom, a white cape, and a plumed morion-type helmet with cheek guards and the Kuja emblem embossed on the front. For footwear, she wears dark brown outdoor boots. Her sword can be seen sheathed horizontally over her lower back, different from most sword-wielding characters seen in the series, who wear their swords on either hip.", "personality": "Despite her size, Aphelandra has shown to be rather timid, often repeating what others have said to her as she obeys their command.

Aphelandra tends to respond to orders in a militaristic manner by suddenly standing straight and using a right-handed salute.", "abilities_and_powers": "Aphelandra is most likely a melee-type fighter where her prodigious size affords her a tremendous advantage over many foes. This large size worked to Luffy's disadvantage, who landed on (and bounced off) her chest during his escape from imprisonment.

He has been seen riding on the back of a large catfish that can move on land.", "personality": "Like the other members of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Fujin is loyal to the shogun Orochi and dedicated to his job. However, he is superstitious and can be prone to being scared, as shown when he was confronted by the skeleton Brook.", "abilities_and_powers": "Fujin is an extremely skilled ninja, as he was able to sneak up on Robin and catch her by surprise along with the other Oniwabanshu members. His specialty, like Raijin's, is \"Slimy Grappling\" (, Numeri Kakut?). The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.

{"name": "Fukaboshi", "episode": "Episode 609", "chapter": "Chapter 528", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "Fukaboshi is an enormous, muscular shark merman, with a wide chest and large arms. He has a long face, framed by wavy fair blue hair flowing down to his shoulders, a sharp and pointy nose, and a dot of some sort printed on the middle of his forehead. He has gills on his massive neck (although they may just be stripes) and a dark blue tail with light blue polka-dots. He wears a dark garment around his waist, held up by an extremely long sash. He also dons a light blue long band, which passes over his shoulders, drawing a circle around the back of his neck, and falls down to his waist, seemingly floating behind him; something all of the three brothers sport, as well as their mother and sister in a fashion, quite possibly implying it is a sign of the Royal Family, or they simply share taste in clothing. He carries around a gold trident with him. In his youth, his appearance was virtually the same, except his facial features were less serious and sharp. When he and his family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, he wore a light colored shirt.", "personality": "He has a great sense of responsibility, as he himself went to look for the crew who had entered the island illegally in case they were the Straw Hats instead of just sending his guards, to deliver Jinbe's message personally. He has a very serious demeanor, but is also polite, as he apologized for bothering the mermaids when he was about to leave the cove, and forgiving, letting the same mermaids go unpunished after discovering they were hiding the Straw Hat Pirates. He also seems to be very reasonable and wise as seen how he handled the hostage situation in Ryugu Palace and not losing his temper. He did not show any animosity towards the Straw Hats and he respectfully conceded to Zoro's demands to reach a mutually beneficial solution. He is very loyal as he did not disregard his promise to Jinbe in delivering his messages to the Straw Hats even though the said pirates \"took over\" the Ryugu Palace. However, when he does lose his temper, he becomes very vicious towards the source of his anger, such as when he brutally defeated Dosun and his men for forcing citizens to step on his mother's photo. Also, when she was mortally wounded, he swore revenge on the one who committed this crime until Otohime calmed him down and made him promise not to hate them on her behalf. After seeing how Shirahoshi honored their mother's last wish, Fukaboshi decided to do the same, saying that he does not hate the imprisoned Hody Jones for killing their mother. He is also shown to be very thoughtful. Unlike the citizens who quickly jumped to conclusions, Fukaboshi suspected something was not right when Luffy was considered an enemy, having a feeling that the Straw Hats are not as bad as the situation made them out to be. When Luffy selflessly helped defend Ryugu Kingdom, Fukaboshi apologized to Luffy for ever doubting him. Like his mother, Otohime, Fukaboshi strongly supports peace and cooperation with humans. When Hody attempts to spread his hatred and vengeance, Fukaboshi confronts him to keep his mother's ideals alive. He appears to be philosophical, stating that the regrets of the dead belong to the dead alone and that grudge is only an illusion created by the living. He also regrets that even he held subconscious spite towards humans, although he is one of the most accepting of all the mermen seen thus far. Along with his father, he is remorseful about leaving the segregated Fish-Man District to fester and grow apart in the darkness of the seafloor, allowing the district's denizens to grow wilder and more hateful of humans. This segregation is acknowledged and modified thanks to Neptune, showing that Fukaboshi and his family are the rare type of royalty in the world, in that they are philanthropic and just, and heavily oppose a caste system which is mundane throughout the surface world. He seems perceptive of at least Luffy's abilities, as he was not surprised when seeing Luffy used Haki on a sea monster. He is also the most serious of the three princes.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Ryugu Kingdom, he has a great deal of authority in the country. As the eldest of his siblings, he is the next in line for the throne. Alongside Ryuboshi and Manboshi, Fukaboshi is one of the three strongest in the Neptune Army. The Minister of the Right also claimed that the Straw Hats would be in trouble if they were confronted by the princes, however the minister underestimated the Straw Hats. Furthermore, Neptune ordered the Minister of the Right to immediately contact Fukaboshi following the New Fish-Man Pirate's invasion, suggesting that Fukaboshi is capable of handling such stressful situations. He also appears to be familiar with Haki, as he was not surprised when Luffy tamed one of the New Fish-Man Pirates' beasts, and commented that it was expected. He was also shown to be able to somewhat sense that Mary Geoise's travelators were powered by slaves. However, it is unknown if he can use the ability as well."},

She's also shown to be rather conceited, calling herself glamorous. In contrast to Zeus, Hera holds the utmost loyalty to Big Mom. However, she does not seem to care much for her fellow special homies, as she immediately turned down Prometheus when he expressed interest in her becoming his girlfriend.

Like other characters, Hera possesses a unique laugh: \"Ohohoho\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "Hera is far more powerful than normal homies, being made from a fragment of Big Mom's very own soul, which gives her a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the Yomi Yomi no Mi's user.

He is also prone to underestimating and condescending people even when he has heard about their feats of strength, as he believed that Luffy only defeated Urashima by luck. He seems to be quick to jump to conclusions, as he believed that Luffy, Zoro, and Kikunojo were accomplices of the thief Shutenmaru after simply seeing Luffy's display of strength. He also holds grudges, as one of his main reasons for attacking Luffy was that the pirate destroyed his house.

{"name": "Hogback", "episode": "Episode 446", "chapter": "Chapter 340", "year": 2007, "note": "He was first mentioned by Hildon in Chapter 444.", "appearance": "Despite his round torso, Hogback has very thin arms and legs. His somewhat long nose resembles a beak or knife, and he has notably sharp and long canine teeth and ears. His face has a scar in the shape of a semi-circle that goes above his eyes and connects both corners of his mouth, which is usually grinning widely, and he keeps his black hair slicked back. On the left side of his neck is a black tattoo consisting of two slashes connected to two swirls lying side-by-side on his shoulder. Hogback wears a fishnet vest, purple leather pants, a thick black tie, and a pair of purple gloves, which cover his long, claw-like fingers. He also wears a white surgical mask under his chin, a pair of very small black gold-rimmed sunglasses, a violet feathery cape that is black on the inside, and a pair of purple high-heeled boots. At the time when he first met Victoria Cindry ten years prior to his encounter with the Straw Hat Pirates, Hogback wore a white double-breasted suit over an indigo shirt, gray pants, and a dark blond feathery cape; he also wore his hair with a small swirl sticking out of the front, as well as a golden bangle and pearl bracelet on his right wrist, a silver bangle and ruby-chain bracelet on his left wrist, and rings with large jewels on each index finger and his left thumb, as well as gold rings on his other fingers. When Brook confronted him five years prior to the Straw Hats' arrival on Thriller Bark, Hogback wore his present-day outfit, but had his hair arranged in a chonmage style. As a child, Hogback wore his hair in a bowl cut, with his bangs framing his face. He had round eyes and a small, normally-shaped nose and mouth. Hogback wore a simple white sweater with the word \"genius\" (, tensai?) printed on it as well as black gloves, pants, and shoes.", "personality": "Hogback is immensely arrogant and extremely proud of his reputation as a genius. However, despite saving the lives of numerous people with his medical knowledge and abilities, Hogback considered his patients an annoyance that he had to put up with for the sake of the money they provided, and viewed the doctors who could not help his patients themselves as morons. His views on being a doctor contrast sharply with those of Tony Tony Chopper, who believes that a true doctor must save all patients no matter what, which led to conflict between the two; Hogback even ridiculed Chopper for admiring him and his medical prowess, believing the young doctor was looking up to skills that only brought irritation in the form of an unending lineup of patients. Hogback believes that, with the help of Moria's power to animate corpses with shadows, he has finally managed to overcome death by bringing corpses to life, dismissing the fact that the personality of a zombie is vastly different from the one they held in life and that their wills are bound to Moria. He does not care about the fate of his undead creations and the people whose shadows were stolen to create them. Despite insisting that they are alive, Hogback has no respect for his creations, viciously abusing and humiliating the reanimated Victoria Cindry during his fight with Chopper and Nico Robin just to prove a point. Despite frequently ending up in humorous situations due to the actions of Cindry, Hogback can be serious at times and can plan ahead when necessary, such as when he requested control of two zombies, Jigoro and Inuppe, from Moria to use as his personal bodyguards in case he encountered the Straw Hats; however, though he used them to great effect against both Chopper and Robin, he displayed a degree of gullibility when Robin tricked him into ordering both zombies to jump out of a nearby window. Like many others, he has a unique laugh: \"Fosfosfosfos\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Of the Mysterious Four, Hogback is the only one with no Devil Fruit or notable combat abilities, Hogback is strickly an authoritative figure and thus relies on the zombies he has created to fight for him. However, he does not have absolute command over them; Gecko Moria is their true master, so Hogback only has command over them if Moria permits it. When the Straw Hats began their counterattack on Thriller Bark, Hogback displayed a degree of strategic aptitude by asking Moria for control over Jigoro and Inuppe, using both to briefly overpower Nico Robin and Tony Tony Chopper; however, he was easily tricked by Robin into accidentally commanding the two zombies to jump out of the window."},

When one of the Beasts Pirates attempted to attack Luffy, Kawamatsu silently aided him by piercing his attacker with a fishbone. His compassion is best shown when he encountered an impoverished Onimaru and fed him with his limited amount of food, despite there being barely enough for himself.

{"name": "Marshall D. Teach", "episode": "Episode 223", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned in Drum Island in Chapter 133. He is formally introduced in Chapter 234. Most commonly referred to by his epithet Blackbeard.", "appearance": "Teach is an extremely tall man with dark skin, being exactly twice Luffy's (pre-timeskip) height. He has a massive build as his body is round with relatively thin limbs. He has a prominent lipped mouth with several broken or missing teeth (though sometimes he does have a full set, which might be an inconsistency error made by Eiichiro Oda), a pronounced crooked nose and a very large and hairy chest and torso. Long, thick, woolly black hair falls down the back of his neck, underneath a black bandanna, and a small scruffy black beard (hence his epithet) grows around his jawline. As the series progresses, his beard becomes longer and scruffier. At his first appearance in Mock Town, Teach wore an open buttoned white shirt with rolled up sleeves, green trousers with black line patterns, a yellow sash around his waist and classic black swashbuckler boots complete with large bronze buckles. During his raid on Banaro Island, he had added a large black and gold captain's coat over his attire, along with white beads on each wrist as bracelets and rings with gemstones on all of the fingers of both his hands (similar to his predecessor, Crocodile). At the Seven Warlords of the Sea meeting at the Marine Headquarters, he added a pair of necklaces of red as well as golden-yellow and blue beads to his dark orange sash (dark yellow in the anime) and a traditional black tricorne hat over his grey bandana, as well as switching to a red shirt, while wearing his captain's coat like a cape. He also has three flintlocks and a flask tied to his sash around his waist. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords of the Sea as children. Teach is shown wearing a baseball cap with a rolled up long sleeve shirt and green shorts. He is also wearing black curled tip shoes, and unlike his usual cheerful expression, is crying for an unknown reason. After the timeskip, Teach has grown a long beard that he has split into multiple sections, very much like his real-life basis. He also wears golden hoop earrings and the same black tricorne with a yellow bandana with red polka dots. He switches to a light purple shirt with a black captains coat with red linings. He has a red and white feather with a purple flower on the side of his tricorne. He has an orange plume alongside with his coat. He now wears dark blue pants with light blue floral designs on them. He also now dons a pair of sunglasses.", "personality": "Teach's personality seems to be a strange mixture of courage and cowardice, carefulness and recklessness, and intelligence and stupidity. While at times his character appears strong and fearsome, like he has full control of a situation, in others he will seem weak and ridiculous, struggling in ways that are unbecoming of a pirate of his stature. All those contrasting elements reinforce the idea that Teach is rather unpredictable and somewhat of an enigma, making him similar to series' protagonist Monkey D. Luffy to a great extent. It is worth noting that Teach was a rather gloomy and serious individual in his childhood, back when he was nothing more than an orphaned pirate apprentice, unlike his more outgoing and expressive adult self. In general, Teach is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a pirate within the series, showing various degrees of greed, dishonesty, brutality, opportunism and cunning. This is a point Teach has in common with his crewmates for the most part, as they are known for being equally rowdy and violent. Having wild personalities under his command, however, does not bother Teach in anyway, as he believes that a pirate crew is primarily defined by its members being in sync about their goals and agendas, with relationships among personnel being a secondary concern. This means that Teach is willing to welcome in anyone who he thinks could assist him in achieving his objectives, whether they are infamous criminals from Impel Down, which is the case for half of his Titanic Captains, former warlords, like Gecko Moria, or even former Marines, such as Kuzan. Like many other characters, Teach has a unique laugh: \"Zehahahahahaha!\". This laugh is not present in the English dub until the Duel on Banaro Island.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Four Emperors and one of the members of the Worst Generation, Teach is one of the most powerful pirates in the world. Even before becoming an Emperor, Teach was an immensely powerful pirate, even for a former member of the Whitebeard Pirates and Seven Warlords of the Sea. At some point in his life, Teach once fought Shanks and gave him the scars on his left eye, with Shanks admitting that the injury did not occur because of carelessness. Their battle led Shanks to cautiously recognize Teach as an extremely dangerous menace. Ace once stated that Teach could have become a commander when he was recommended for the position. The most remarkable thing in these two feats is that Teach had not yet eaten a Devil Fruit. After the Summit War of Marineford, the Five Elders believed that Teach had a one-step lead to usurp the position of Emperor that Whitebeard once held, which eventually came to fruition. During the timeskip, he gained mass notoriety with his bounty being set at 2,247,600,000, showing how dangerous he had become. For unknown reasons, it was later raised to 3,996,000,000, making his bounty the second highest out of the current Emperors and the highest among the former Warlords of the Sea and members of the Worst Generation. He easily defeated his fellow ex-Warlord, Boa Hancock, and even Silvers Rayleigh, the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\", confessed that he would stand no chance against Teach due to his elderly age. He managed to defeat Trafalgar D. Water Law whose bounty is worth 3,000,000,000 and one of the two pirates responsible for defeating former Emperor Big Mom. One of the most prominent feats that showcase Teach's incredible power were displayed by him defeating three division commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates: Thatch, Portgas D. Ace, and later during the Payback War, Marco, the new captain of the Whitebeard Pirates. After the timeskip, he and his crew fought against the Revolutionary Army and destroyed their headquarters on Baltigo, before briefly clashing against the Marines and the Cipher Pol and eventually fleeing the place."},

Like her fellow Kuja, she dresses in a revealing bikini top and miniskirt made out of animal skin that greatly show off her cleavage and long legs, and a white cape that seems to resemble a Marine jacket. She keeps her snake (which almost all Kuja women seem to have) who is black and green striped wrapped around her waist at most times. She is also known to wear some type of black and white striped legging similar to a stocking on her right leg, along with high-heeled boots.", "personality": "Although it is forbidden to have men on the Amazon Lily, Marguerite seems to have developed an interest in them ever since seeing Luffy. She also seems to have developed an interest in Luffy's \"Kintama\" (a Japanese slang term for the male testicle which literally translates to \"Golden ball(s)\"), wanting Luffy to take them off, so she could have a look at them. This is mostly due to her misunderstanding and navet towards men, taking everything Luffy said as literal. She deems men as \"useless\" based on the impressions left by Luffy, but at the same time admitted that she risked becoming attached to him if she stayed with him for too long, resulting in attacking him as a way of stopping herself. Like the rest of the Kuja tribe, she eventually begins to care for and respect Luffy during the Amazon Lily Arc. She also seems to admire her leader, Boa Hancock, calling her \"the most beautiful woman in the world\", and seems to hold no grudge against Hancock for petrifying her. Marguerite is very honest, shown when she tried to take the full blame for Luffy's presence on Amazon Lily, prompting Sweet Pea and Aphelandra to also try to take the blame with her.", "abilities_and_powers": "Marguerite appears to be a talented seamstress, as she was able to completely replicate Luffy's tattered vest and shorts, and even added a floral pattern and frills to his vest, much to his dismay. She also knows how to swim, as proven when she saved Luffy from drowning. Another note is that Amazon Lily is located in the Calm Belt where Sea Kings breed and so the sea around the island is full of Sea Kings, yet she jumped in to save Luffy despite this. She was seen accompanying Boa Hancock on the Kuja pirate ship after the two-year timeskip, indicating that she has become strong enough to become part of the crew, since only the strongest warriors are allowed on the ship."},

She is fairly short in stature and wears her dark red hair tied in twin braids. Her attire consists of a wide-brimmed pink hat with a green band, a dark blue T-shirt with the word \"GOLDEN\" written on it in pink (orange in the anime), a sky blue cloud-patterned button-down shirt, a maroon-colored overalls skirt with the top folded down, blue striped stockings, and big red shoes with white cuffs and white soles. She is usually seen eating rice crackers.", "personality": "Marianne is laid back to the extreme and never passes up a good chance to relax. For instance, she set up a picnic during an ongoing battle. Another example of her easygoing nature was when she sat a few feet away from a cup of tea, apparently too lazy to walk over to it and pick it up herself. She skillfully conveyed this message to her partner using only her eyes, and when Mr. 3 understood, he chided her but brought her the cup anyway. Regardless of her laid back persona, Marianne takes her missions rather seriously, as she prevented Luffy from destroying her partner's Candle Set to save his crew.", "abilities_and_powers": "Marianne utilizes her unique skills as a painter to employ a special type of hypnosis based on colored paint. In this way, she can change a person's personality through the use of certain colors, influencing their behavior as she sees fit and forcing them to do whatever the trap suggests no matter what."},

He wears a navy blue suit over a black tie and a white buttoned shirt, as well as navy blue pants.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Mars cares about the balance in the world maintained by the Three Great Powers and wishes to maintain it. This also includes preserving the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. During the Ohara Incident, he was courteous to Clover, acknowledging the scholar's achievements and justifying the danger of reviving the ancient weapons. At the time of ordering the killing of scholars, Mars was seriously embarrassed when he gave that order. He appears to view the Nefertari Family's rejection of life on Mary Geoise harshly, as he stated that such an action makes them traitors. He will obey any order given by Imu without question, as he views Imu to be a \"creator\" who alone has the power to shape the course of the world. Mars has been shown to be extremely callous, as he had no issue with annihilating a highly populated country and justified it because its populace had started to show signs of rebellion. While other Elders have occasionally struggled with their composure in the wake of massive threats, Mars has always been shown with a calm and stoic demeanor. He seems to keep profiles on people, allowing him to be discerning when discussing them, as he knew that Shanks' personality made his contact with Whitebeard less threatening. He also knew that Blackbeard's past would give him a great advantage in replacing Whitebeard as an Emperor, and wanted to know the connection between Luffy and Rayleigh. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Five Elders, Mars is one of the few to have the \"highest authority of the World Government\", being above even the World Nobles. He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is Imu."},
{"name": "Momoo", "episode": "Episode 73", "chapter": "Chapter 31", "year": 1999, "note": "", "appearance": "Momoo is a giant sea cow with a seal-like structure, with a height of 36 meters (118'1\" feet) and weighing 16 tons (32,000 lbs). Despite having fish-like scales covering his body from his neck to his stomach, Momoo is classified as a mammal Sea Beast. These scales are actually his hardened skin, protecting his vital organs from external attacks as an armor. He has a big, round nose with a gold nose ring, cow-esque face, horns, and green spots throughout his body. Besides helping him swim, his fins contain retractable bones sharp enough to act as claws.", "personality": "Like most pirate pets, Momoo is very simpleminded, and spends most of his waking time focused on either food or obeying those he recognizes as superiors. As a carnivore of great size and strength, he has no qualms about eating any humans who approach him. However, he is easily intimidated by those he cannot overpower, and developed a severe phobia of the Straw Hat Pirates in particular after receiving multiple beatings from them, particularly Luffy and Sanji. His behavior has not changed even after two years. After seeing the Straw Hats again during the journey to Fish-Man Island, he quickly fled in terror, but the Caribou Pirates easily forced him to turn back by giving him a lump on the head.", "abilities_and_powers": "Momoo is strong enough to destroy an entire village, as seen with Gosa Village. Momoo (as other sea cows) also has the strength to overturn ships while searching for food. He has a well-developed sense of smell, allowing him to lurk on the bottom of the sea and emerge at once to attack his target without giving them time to react. Due to his gigantic fins, he can swim as fast as 70 km/h (43,5 mps). The hardened skin on his body serve as an armor, protecting him from external attacks. Momoo can also swallow his prey whole. His four stomachs (just as a normal cow has) are full of various bacteria and parasites that actively digest whatever he eats. Thus, Momoo won't suffer any damage even if he eats a highly poisonous animal."},

Every time Mohji appears in the series for an arc, his hairstyle changes. During the Orange Town Arc, his hair was shaped like a teddy bear. In the Loguetown Arc he wears a pink helmet with bunny ears sticking out. When the group makes it into the Grand Line, during the Jaya Arc his hair is shaped like a lion's mane. In the Impel Down Arc, his hairstyle causes him to resemble a ram, somewhat similar to Merry. After the timeskipMohji, along with his petRichie, had apparently gained muchweight whereMohji now has a very plump appearance. He also wears a dark blue fur suit, and his hairstyle resembles a panda.", "personality": "Mohji is quite pompous and, at times, silly. He has also displayed a strong rivalry with Cabaji, Buggy's second mate, during the Buggy mini-arc. He tends to treat Richie better than most other people and adores the big lion. He even takes it offensively when Richie is used as a shield by Cabaji against Luffy, Zoro and Nami.", "abilities_and_powers": "Mohji claims to have the ability to control any animal he wishes. However, he was not able to tame Chouchou, who bit Mohji when he tried. He has yet to prove his ability in the series outside of his pet, a lion named Richie (who seems to have an emphatic link with him). Mohji usually opts to use him in battle rather than fight himself. He is, however, fast and agile, and very skilled with a whip."},

He was formally introduced in Chapter 516.", "appearance": "Momonga is a man with a black mohawk and a mustache (dark red in the anime). He wears the standard marine uniform, consisting of a purple and white pinstripe suit with a coat draped over his shoulders, like Kizaru. Underneath his coat lies a dark blue shirt and a light blue tie. He is of relatively tall height and very well-built. He carries around his weapon of choice, a katana, either attached to his right hip or on his shoulder. In his youth, he wore a marine cap and had not yet grown a mustache. Twenty-seven years ago Momonga looked the same, except his mustache was much longer and thinner, and his mohawk was arranged in a different style, pointing forward.", "personality": "Momonga is very serious. He is stern and dead set on completing all of his missions. As of yet, it is uncertain what type of \"Justice\" he follows, although he appears to be sincerely concerned on the welfare of his subordinates. However, he is sometimes easily annoyed by their incompetence, as seen when they quickly fell for Hancock's charms. He is apparently instinctive, being that he figured out a way to block the effects of Boa Hancock's Mero Mero Mellow beam in mere seconds. Although he is not completely immune to her beauty, he is at least resilient enough to not be completely captivated by her charms. Momonga also appears to value etiquette and civility, as he was quickly disgusted by the atrocious behavior of many despicable Level 6 inmates in Impel Down when a large number of them began hooting and hollering at the sight of Boa Hancock and said disgusting things toMagellan, which he found highly undignified and vulgar.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a vice admiral within the marines, Momonga can execute a Buster Call if he has the support of four other vice admirals and has authority over a large number of subordinates and those of lower rank. Momonga has respectable abilities in both mind and body. When he waits to \"collect\" Hancock, he kills a Sea King from the inside. Similarly, he is able to block Hancock's Devil Fruit abilities by stabbing his hand with a knife, using pain to block the lust that consumed the rest of his crew and turned them into stone. Hancock stated that it was his experience that prevented him from being affected by her power. Momonga also leaves Hancock with a warning that even without his men he is still dangerous."},
{"name": "Monkey D. Dragon", "episode": "Episode 100", "chapter": "Chapter 52", "year": 1999, "note": "His full name was revealed by Monkey D. Garp in Chapter 432.", "appearance": "Dragon is a tall middle-aged man with spiky black hair with a widow's peak and a tattoo on the left side of his face, which is colored dark red in the anime and bright red in the manga. He has a bit of stubble on his chin. He is usually dressed in a long green cloak, underneath which he wears the orange garb of a revolutionary. He is most often seen sporting a grin. Only on rare occasions, such as at Roger's execution, has Dragon not been seen smiling. 22 years before the start of the series, at Gol D. Roger's execution, Dragon did not have his tattoo or his stubble on his face. After the timeskip, Dragon's hair has grown slightly longer, reaching down his back past his shoulders.", "personality": "As the leader of the Revolutionary Army, Dragon is dedicated to dismantling the World Government and its corrupt nobility system that allows its World Nobles to oppress lower-class citizens as they please. He considers the corrupt nobility in his homeland of the Goa Kingdom to be the same problem on a smaller scale and was enraged when their self-serving actions caused an innocent noble boy like Sabo to denounce them. When he rescued Sabo the next day from being attacked by a World Noble's ship, Dragon was shown with a powerful glare of anger on his face. Dragon is typically seen with a serious and business-minded disposition and takes care to stay highly informed about the happenings of the world and educate his subordinates about relevant objects and events in current affairs. Dragon is quick to caution his subordinates against celebrating small victories, reminding them of the war they are in and of the World Government's great power. However, he has been shown smiling when reflecting on the changing course of the world, particularly his son Luffy's role in it as a pirate. Dragon is extremely secretive about his personal life and history, as he did not tell anyone in the Revolutionary Army that he was Garp's son or Luffy's father, and once shut down an attempt by Ivankov to ask if he had family out in the world. When the news of his family ties came out following the Summit War of Marineford, Dragon noted that it would help his subordinates to see him as a human for once. Dragon has shown himself to be an empathetic person, particularly to those who are oppressed by the World Government's system. He checked to see if a young Sabo was all right after seeing him be thrown to the ground, and did not hesitate to take his denouncement of the Goa Kingdom's nobles extremely seriously. He cares greatly for the plights of people who are oppressed by the World Government and their member islands, and seeks them out to invite them to join his fight for freedom. He also cares about the members and associates of his army, as shown when he asked Koala if Nico Robin was doing well. When he was under the impression that Portgas D. Ace was Dragon's son, Emporio Ivankov expected that Dragon would go to Marineford to save Ace, showing that Dragon holds love and care towards his family and possibly his son, Luffy, despite not being involved in his childhood. Dragon is very unforgiving to those he consider had done wrong, stating he would not forgive Sabo if he really had killed Nefertari Cobra during the Levely no matter the reason, as killing regular royals is not part of the Revolutionary Army's goals.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Army, Dragon has the greatest authority over a powerful, globally active paramilitary that has risen to become a prominent threat to the expansive, centuries-old World Government in only a few years. Dragon's actions have given him the distinction of being the \"World's Worst Criminal,\" yet he has managed to lead a largely secure existence despite the world's greatest powers being after him. After Luffy tells Emporio Ivankov that Ace is his brother, the okama queen greatly fears the possibility of the World Government warring against Dragon along with Whitebeard. While his individual combat abilities are mostly unknown, he is able to command extremely powerful army officials like his chief-of-staff Sabo and the five commanders, who have all been shown battling and defeating notable pirates and Marines in the Grand Line. When Sengoku told everyone of his relationship with Luffy, most people were stunned, including Gecko Moria of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and members of the Whitebeard Pirates. This reputation alone was enough for Luffy to be marked as a dangerous potential to the future, and for Demaro Black to take advantage of via impersonation. Dragon himself was able to grab Smoker's jitte when the Marine captain was preparing to use it on Luffy, quickly stopping him in his tracks, and despite Dragon's great criminal status, Smoker was not seen making the effort to try and apprehend him. Additionally, Ivankov noted that Luffy's inhuman will to live in Impel Down made sense for a son of Dragon, indicating that Dragon has a similar level of tenacity. While at the Goa Kingdom and Loguetown, strong blasts of wind have occurred in close proximity to Dragon, which have helped him accomplish his objectives in both places. It remains unconfirmed if Dragon was directly responsible for these wind blasts or if he has a power enabling him to create them. Additionally, Dragon was somehow able to reach Sabo's ship as it was sinking far off the coast of Dawn Island and grab him right before he sank without drawing attention from any onlookers."},
{"name": "Monet", "episode": "Episode 657", "chapter": "Chapter 581", "year": 2012, "note": "Her name was revealed in Chapter 662.", "appearance": "As a harpy, she had white feathered wings instead of arms that fade to light green at the edges, talons instead of feet, and a tail. She had the build of an average human, but her long legs made her much taller. She had long, wavy, light green hair and brown eyes. In the anime, her eyes are amber. She was also considered very attractive as several Marines commented on her appearance. She wore a green cropped tank top with \"HAPPY\" written in dark green on the chest and yellow cut-off pants with orange stripes. She had a Baby Den Den Mushi strapped to her belt. She was usually seen wearing glasses while reading, implying she was farsighted. The glasses have circles in a ripple pattern on the lenses, giving the appearance of thick spectacles. In a flashback, she was seen with human limbs, wearing a blue and white striped shirt and blue bloomers, as well as a set of blue heels. When enraged, Monet could transform her body into a large demonic entity with sharp teeth and berserk-like eyes. In the manga, Monet's legs had human skin below the cutoff of her pants until the first joint, while in the anime, her legs had all bird skin below the cutoff of her pants. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Monet is shown wearing a white tank top, black pants that went down to her knees, and standard glasses.", "personality": "Monet appeared to have a very flippant personality, choosing to only inform Caesar about the disaster unfolding on Punk Hazard, after finding out that the intruders were the Straw Hat Pirates. Despite all of the uproar, she maintained the thrilled smile on her face, implying she found it amusing. Monet was also shown examples of being quite diligent, like how she explained to Caesar how the Straw Hat Pirates' real strength might be above their current bounties, being unsurprised by Luffy breaking through her barrier noting an ordinary pirate could not do so, recognizing that she couldn't defeat Luffy in battle, knowing how to delay him effectively, she also did not believe that she could beat Zoro in a sword fight and instead tried to aim for the weaker targets: Nami, Chopper and Robin. Zoro commented on this, stating it was pitiful she attacked people who could not even defend themselves, due to their lack of Haki. While fighting foes that are more powerful than her, she will use cunning tactics to gain an advantage or attack foes that are weak. If she has control of the situation, she displays a confident demeanor. However, Monet can be overconfident, which results in her underestimating her foes. When fighting against Tashigi, she assumed Zoro would not attack a woman, but this was because Zoro was holding back as he did not take her as a challenging opponent. Monet was also a very calm and level-headed individual, as she rarely got surprised or angry in regard to either situation and always maintained a relaxed demeanor even in the heat of battle. Also, unlike Caesar, she was a much more skillful liar, such as all the children believing her about Caesar's treatments on them to cure illnesses. Despite knowing of Caesar's cruel treatment towards the children and his own underlings, Monet continued to follow him without hesitation (likely due to her mission to watch over him from Doflamingo's order). She could also be rather flirtatious, such as flirting with Law when he returned to the lab and even thinking about a date when he said he needed her. When commented on her looks and being told of her beauty, she bashfully blushed despite the serious situation. She also tried to cover herself with her wings and her knees buckled as well, suggesting she was rather shy to compliments. Monet has been shown to be rather sadistic, seemingly enjoyed the suffering of others such as chuckling at Law's pain from encountering Vergo. She, like Caesar, gave the children the terrible drug, NHC10, with a smile, showing that she was just as ruthless as her master while even knowing of how they will die within five years yet she showed no concern whatsoever. When Mocha was in danger and being chased by the drug enhanced children, Monet showed no concern and even derided her situation when her life was on the line. She expressed no remorse for what was happening to either Mocha or the berserk children, and even mockingly stated that she and Caesar had raised them, giving them a carefree life, despite using them as test subjects. Like Doflamingo, she had a habit of sticking her tongue out in a sadistic manner when she was amused about a predicament or when she attempted to kill someone. Monet could also be terrifying when enraged such as when the Straw Hat Pirates and the Marines tried to stop the kids, Monet was furious at them for attempting to ruin her long, hard work and even justified her actions against the children by claiming that she gave the kids a happy and carefree life. Monet isn't without fear, as when Zoro was charging at her, Monet could not move and was cut in half. Even though his sword was not imbued with Haki, the thought of being killed left her unable to reform properly. Monet had a habit of licking her lips, usually when she got excited, like when she was about to fight Luffy or heard something interesting, such as Luffy being able to use Haoshoku Haki in the anime.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a harpy, Monet had the ability to fly. Her feathers were prehensile enough for her wings to double as hands, as she was seen holding a newspaper with them. Although they made for rather large hands, she was able to do delicate things with them such as turning pages and writing. She could also use her talons to slash foes. Monet seemed to be a good researcher, as she was able to look up information about the Straw Hats in a short amount of time and later inform Caesar about Law's involvements with Luffy from two years ago. She was also quite perceptive, noting that the true strength of the Straw Hat Pirates might be more than what their bounties suggested given their two years of seeming inactivity. Monet was also cunning enough to be able to delay Luffy effectively even though he outclassed her. In direct combat, Monet was capable, being able to fight against Luffy and later Zoro without much difficulty (though she did admit she would not be able to defeat them and was only able to hold them off). With her powers, she was able to overwhelm both Nami and Robin with little effort and even clash with a powerful swordsman such as Zoro (when he was holding back). Her skills were great enough to defeat Tashigi, a Marine Captain, with little effort, and she would have killed her had Zoro not interfered."},

He also has a golden loop earring on his left ear.", "personality": "Onigumo is a firm believer of the Absolute Justice philosophy, and is willing to sacrifice anything to defeat what is defined as \"evil\". This was shown when a soldier questioned Onigumo's order of destroying a fellow Buster Call ship and one thousand comrades just to kill Monkey D. Luffy, which led Onigumo to shoot him in cold blood. In the anime, his dedication to Absolute Justice is further shown at Marineford, when he gave a charismatic speech to other Marines telling them that their victory in the pursuit for justice must be absolute. Despite his calm exterior at such moments, he is capable of rage and shock, as when the Buster Call failed, and when Monkey D. Garp was seemingly defeated by his grandson, respectively.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine vice admiral, Onigumo is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside four other vice admirals.

His fur is light, with his legs being dark below the knees. He is rather large, appearing to be over half the size of the very large kappa Kawamatsu. As Gyukimaru, he is a very large man with a face resembling a mask. He wears a dark kimono, light pants, and a light cape, and carries many weapons on his back. He also wears a very large bead necklace.", "personality": "Onimaru is fiercely protective of the graves of those buried in Ringo, and has tirelessly worked to protect them for almost two decades, enduring multiple injuries in the process but never wavering. Onimaru is very violent against those who try to violate the graves. It was only when Kawamatsu offered Onimaru his arm that the komagitsune let the samurai take the weapons from the graves. As Gyukimaru, he was unwilling to believe Roronoa Zoro's claim that he had rightfully obtained Shusui from Shimotsuki Ryuma. He does not seem to take much interest in activities outside of guarding the graves and stealing weapons from passersby. Onimaru has shown in his Gyukimaru transformation that he is very intelligent and aware of the legends and history of Wano. This is seen as he greatly reveres the legends of Ryuma, and so went to great lengths to return Shusui to his grave, as he left Ringo and went to Ebisu Town near the Flower Capital just to take it back. He is rather pragmatic in battle and always looks for an opening on his opponent, even when they are distracted or caught up by something else altogether. However, he is merciful enough to not attack an opponent who can no longer fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Onimaru is a skilled thief, being able to successfully steal Shusui from Zoro and make his way halfway across Wano Country at a fast pace. His jaw is quite strong, as he was able to instantly cause considerable injury to Kawamatsu's arm by biting it. He also has considerable endurance, as he stood to protect the graves after being struck by arrows, and in the present day, he was able to withstand a bazooka shot from one of the Beasts Pirates."},

In the manga, he was overweight, but in the anime, he was quite muscular. When the Arlong Pirates first arrived at Cocoyasi Village, Pisaro wore a flower-patterned shirt. When he was a member of the Sun Pirates, Pisaro wore similar attire, and the anime kept his slimmer appearance. In the anime, he wore a green vest with yellow lines on it.", "personality": "Pisaro is fearful of Arlongs rage, as seen when he and his crewmates tried to calm Arlong down and prevent him from destroying Cocoyasi Village. He is very allegiant to Arlong and followed him to the East Blue, and he seemed indifferent to Arlongs mistreatment of humans.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a fish-man, he possesses the strength of ten men and has incredible mobility underwater as well as the ability to stay submerged for as long as he desires.

It possessed scales on its body, and a row of rounded spikes along its back. Its legs were extremely short, impeding its mission to climb.", "personality": "Like other drawings brought to life by the Fude Fude no Mi, Ryunosuke was very loyal to the commands of its creator, and thus was determined as possible to complete the task of carrying people up Zunesha that it was given, despite the great strain on its weak form.

He was somewhat classy and prejudiced as he gave Luffy, Zoro, and Nami some money as a pity so they could buy decent clothes. He interpreted Zoro and Luffy's refusal to fight back when Bellamy challenged them at Terry's bar as an act of cowardice, and insisted that Bellamy's quick defeat at Luffy's hands was a \"lucky shot\" and even attempted to challenge the younger pirate, only to cringe once the Straw Hat captain finally gave Sarquiss his attention. Unfortunately he did not seem to learn from this, as soon after Luffy leaves, he ends up bumping into Blackbeard and made a rude remark towards him and continues to badmouth Luffy, to which the captain promptly smashes Sarquiss into the ground. Just like his captain, he strongly believes that a New Age is coming and laughs at anyone who mentions their dreams. He also falsely believes that a bounty serves as a rating of a person's fighting level, making him believe himself to be a more powerful fighter than he truly is.", "abilities_and_powers": "Sarquiss possesses a bounty of 38,000,000, an indication of his danger.

He wore a sleeveless shirt with shorts, until Kin'emon gave all the children jackets. His jacket was light colored, with a dark colored hood, and fur at the end of the sleeves.

He was desperate to get out of the Biscuits Room. When deprived of the drug NHC10, Sind became very aggressive, brutally punching Luffy into part of the building. Otherwise, he is a normal timid child, as he was scared of Kin'emon's severed head. When not under the effects of the drug, Sind is a boy with high hopes, as he had reassured Mocha near the beginning of being taken from his home, believing that they would be better soon and be able to go home quickly. He has also stated that he wanted to be a pirate at the age of 20, getting very excited for it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to the experiments, Sind has become larger and therefore stronger than average children, as he was strong enough to send Luffy crashing into a wall with one punch."},
{"name": "Silvers Rayleigh", "episode": "Episode 19", "chapter": "Chapter 8", "year": 1998, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 500.", "appearance": "Rayleigh is an elderly man of relatively tall height with a very muscular build and tan skin. Two of his most distinguishing traits are his round glasses and facial hair, which is arranged embattled across his lower jaw. He also has a scar over his right eye, which he has had for many years. Rayleigh chooses to dress quite simply, usually just in a nearly plain t-shirt, shorts, and sandals. When out in public, he also seems to enjoy the cover of a large silver hooded cloak, though the hood is often down. Underneath these clothes, the old man's body is surprisingly built and very well-toned, a testament to his incredible strength. When Rayleigh was younger, he had clean cut strawberry blond hair (black when first seen in the anime) and had a moderate amount of facial hair. Over the years, as his hair whitened, he grew it out. He also grew a beard from his initial striped facial hair. During Roger's last year alive, Rayleigh was noticeably taller, reaching almost the same height as his former captain. Regardless of his age, Rayleigh is a muscular man with a broad chest and well-built body. During Rayleigh's first appearance in Buggy's flashback, he was seen wearing a t-shirt with an ornately decorated collar, a motif that appeared even in the long coat he wore during the Battle of Edd War. He wore an orange shirt, light-brown spotted bermudas, and simple sandals. He also has a silver-colored coat hanging from his shoulders. After the two-year timeskip, Rayleigh now wears a black T-shirt as well as his silver hooded cloak.", "personality": "Rayleigh is light-hearted, casual, and fun loving, much like his captain Roger was. In the past, he was shown to have been impatient with the antics of the younger crew members and took the position of crew disciplinarian very seriously. However, he has changed his personality in his older years, becoming much more relaxed even when training Luffy. Though he often has a serious air, Rayleigh enjoys going with the flow and appearing in unexpected places and in unexpected ways, especially given his status and age. He often comments on his age and how his body \"does not work the way it used to\", much like Garp. Rayleigh is not often headstrong, looking before he leaps and taking time to plan ahead before taking action, although he does not hesitate to act if needs be. Even when entering into an unfortunate or unplanned situation such as engaging a Marine admiral in combat or having his ship sink in the Sea King infested waters of the Grand Line, Rayleigh remains completely calm, pushing forward through adversity with no hesitation. However, Rayleigh has something of a fatherly side to him. This is shown when it comes to Luffy and Hancock, and when pushed, Rayleigh is capable of anger when provoked. When Blackbeard invaded Amazon Lily and tried to kill Hancock, Rayleigh stared furiously towards him, even referring him as a brat who he didn't like. He is typically open and talkative, and like Whitebeard, seems to enjoy talking about the past and its great times, as well as the good old days of their near-bygone era. In spite of this, he appeared reluctant to get into the darker topic of the Void Century. He was willing to divulge the whole truth to Nico Robin if she wished, but she declined his offer. Like Whitebeard, he is also aware of his own limitations that he's far past his prime. In spite of his legendary status, Rayleigh admitted he would be no match for Blackbeard in a straight up fight at his age and was gambling on his reputation to scare him off. As stated by Shakky, he loves alcohol and women, which he proved when he is first introduced saving Camie from being mistreated by Disco while holding a hip flask. He prefers to be called \"Ray-san\". Despite once being enemies with the Whitebeard Pirates, Rayleigh seems to have great respect for their captain, like Roger, and shed a tear for Whitebeard's passing.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\", Rayleigh is an extremely skilled and powerful combatant. Shakuyaku stated that he was \"100 times stronger\" than all of the Eleven Supernovas by the time they first arrived on the Sabaody Archipelago. In his younger days with Gol D. Roger, Rayleigh commanded the rest of Roger's crew as his first mate and held several duties, like supervising his subordinates, including the young apprentices Buggy and Shanks. When Vice Admiral Garp was informed that Rayleigh may be on the Sabaody Archipelago, he told his men not to confront him, nor should Fleet Admiral Sengoku be informed. Garp reasoned that the Marines should not confront two legends, Whitebeard and Rayleigh, at the same time and even admitted that if the Marines were to make an honest attempt at capturing Rayleigh, they would need to do serious preparation if they did not want to lose countless soldiers in the attempt, a true testament to his extraordinary strength. His reputation alone was enough to have Blackbeard, one of the Four Emperors who had spent two years mastering the Yami Yami no Mi and the Gura Gura no Mi, to retreat from Amazon Lily. Rayleigh's immense battle prowess allowed him to fight on par with Admiral Kizaru, preventing him from attacking the Straw Hat Pirates. However, he himself has admitted that he is not as young as he used to be, and as a result can tire in battle. He also stated that due to his old age, he would likely be incapable of defeating Blackbeard. This implies that when he was in the prime of his strength, he may have been even stronger than when he fought Kizaru and could pose a serious threat to Blackbeard. Eustass Kid himself even states that Rayleigh was a \"legend\". Rayleigh is also an expert in the coating business, as he performs such operations for various pirate ships heading down to Fish-Man Island, and he understands the workings of deep-sea currents."},

His attire is composed of an orange fur-lined jacket, with brown swollen sleeves decorated by beige spots; loose matching orange pants held up by a belt, fur-lined gloves and boots, and a purple scarf around his neck. He's dark haired, and on his back there is a pair of typical wings, a standard feature of all the inhabitants of Skypiea. He carries his weapon of choice, a jousting lance, powered by a Heat Dial, and is almost always seen riding his pet giant bird, Fuza.", "personality": "Like all the other priests, Shura is confident in his abilities, and willing to kill every transgressor. Despite his proven cruelty, he has shown some moments of apparent pity and understanding, such as when he was talking to Chopper, even referring to him with his first name.

Her tail is dark blue with a dorsal fin on her lower back where her human and fish halves meet, a white patch below the dorsal fin, smaller fins on the lower front and back, and a lunate caudal fin. Uniquely, the dorsal of her fish attribute is the front of her tail, with the usual ventral attribute facing the back. She wears a hooded purple blouse that is only buttoned in the middle, revealing her cleavage and stomach and has a belly-chain around her waist. She is often seen smoking a pipe. As a child, she wore a light-colored hooded dress with a stripe down the side. However, the anime showed that her dress is the same color as her current outfit.", "personality": "Madam Shyarly is a very kind woman, as she lent the Straw Hat Pirates a room in which they could take care of Sanji, even though said crew defeated her brother. She also gave Camie the rest of the day off so that she could spend time with her friends. She apparently does not like rudeness or vulgarity as she became very angry when Luffy asked if mermaids poop. However, her anger seems to be short-lived, as she calmed down and returned to her normal self almost instantly after Luffy apologized. Even though she is a fortune teller, Madam Shyarly regards her gift as a burden, since most of her visions are of bad things. As a consequence, she thinks that the future is better left unknown. However, even though she said that she quit fortune telling, she was still curious enough to look into Luffy's future. When she had a vision of a man in a straw hat who will be responsible for the destruction of Fish-Man Island, she went into a state of panic screaming that Luffy should be banished from Fish-Man Island, which showed how terrified she was. However, this changed when the New Fish-Man Pirates started taking over the island and Shyarly calmly told their captain, Hody Jones, that Monkey D. Luffy will be the one to destroy Fish-Man Island and not Hody himself, showing that she is willing to believe her own fortune telling over any other apparent predicaments. After the civil war ended, she destroyed her crystal ball, claiming that she will never look into the future again and that she would be very happy if her last prediction did not become true. Unlike her brother, Arlong, Shyarly is not prejudiced against all humans as she even encouraged the Fish-Man Island children to see with their own eyes instead of just listening to the opinions of others.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the proprietor of the Mermaid Cafe, she has complete control of the restaurant. Being a mermaid, she has several abilities unique to her race. It is not yet shown but she may have the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is one of basic ability found in all mermaids. Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, as a mermaid she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the Flying Fish Riders.

{"name": "Ulti", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "Her name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978.", "appearance": "Ulti is a young woman of middling height, with a light complexion. Her hair reaches near her mid-back and forms rounded locks mainly blue in coloration, but with thin, pink-colored streaks running through (plus a single white one over her left eye). Blunt bangs fall on her forehead, split near the left, and an ahoge stands up on her head. Characteristically (as with many of her crewmates), Ulti has horns: a sharp, upward-curving pair emerging from the sides of her head, white in color, that resemble a bull's. Ulti's eyes are large, round, fringed by long lashes, and encompass violet irises. Her lower face up to the nose is covered by a pink mask with a scalloped edge, trimmed with a white stripe; Ulti keeps this mask even when she assumes her pachycephalosaurus form. When in her Human-Beast Form, Ulti's bangs are pushed back, exposing her forehead. Otherwise, Ulti takes to wearing a long-sleeved minidress that is white and pleated above the waist, with a blue bow below a point collar. The dress's lower, light-blue, and non-pleated section, with a button placket in the middle, ends in a short skirt part that has a slightly ruffled hem, leaving most of Ulti's legs visible. Fastened on her shoulders is a darker-blue cape trimmed with light-blue fur on its edges (the inside also blue), which goes near the ground, and her footwear are red high heels.", "personality": "Ulti is a bold, rude, and short-tempered young woman, not one to back down from a verbal quarrel and regularly threatening violence against those who annoy her. Somewhat fickle, she is shown acting friendly and trying to come off as refined, mature one moment, then yelling whilst dangerously blunt the next. Not even the likes of Queen or Kaidou, both her direct superiors (and the latter of whom most crew members seem at least somewhat afraid of), are safe from her vitriol, implying that she does not fear them at all, even to her fellow Tobiroppo's shock. Also, Ulti has no issue with generally acting in a highly casual manner towards Kaidou, expressing loud, girly glee during their reunion. Ulti is merciless towards enemies and willing to brutalize them without hesitation. She is also not above hitting a child if annoyed, as seen when she clawed at Tama for begging her to stop hurting her friend. In battle, due to her aggressive nature, Ulti is quick to attack anyone she deems an enemy. Still, she remains a quick decision-maker and keeps her guard up continuously, as shown when she set upon and seemingly crushed Monkey D. Luffy in their first clash. Rather than gloat and let down her guard like the grunts around her, Ulti instead kept track of him using Haki, quickly transforming and readying for further combat upon sensing Luffy's own Haki. Ulti has a somewhat vengeful streak. She tends to grow extremely angry over, and swear to get payback for, enemies hurting her or her brother, Page One, even when the responsible party is much stronger than Ulti, like the Emperor Big Mom. Despite her childish bearing, Ulti can be smarter than she lets on. In the past, she managed to steal two Devil Fruits from Kaidou to give to herself and her brother, thus giving them the strength necessary for them to survive in the crew and ultimately rise through its ranks. In her speech, Ulti follows certain \"trends\" to come across as fancy. Since her debut, she has taken to ending her sentences (sometimes incorrectly) with arinsu (?)an archaic, polite copula and variant of arimasu that means \"to be\" and is associated with courtesans/oiranas well as the first-person pronoun achiki (?), likewise associated with courtesans. According to Page One, said verbal habits (which become a generally sophisticated register in the Viz translation) are an attempt of Ulti's to sound like a fancy lady. When she snaps due to being annoyed, however, Ulti slips into a vulgar and bratty tone and uses the more neutral pronoun \"watashi\" (?), showing how superficial the woman's mature manner of talking is. Overall, Ulti has had many different ways of ending her sentences that changed over time (see below).", "abilities_and_powers": "Being one of the Tobiroppo, Ulti holds great authority among the Beast Pirates despite her young age, with only Kaidou and the All-Stars ranking above her. True to her Tobiroppo status and 400,000,000 bounty, Ulti is a very powerful combatant, enough so to pose a threat to Luffya Worst Generation member with a bounty over one billion higher than hers at the timeand have him both remark on her great power and consider using Gear 4 when Ulti held him down. Together with Page One, Ulti was able to effortlessly defeat Nami and Usopp; the former, in particular, Ulti has been able to get the better of and subdue in a matter of seconds."},

He is also said to have eliminated many death row prisoners in the past, a further testament to his fighting prowess.However, he was no match for Hajrudin, as he was defeated in one blow by the giant. Ucy has shown good strength and speed. Even with some injuries, he was able to easily carry Luffy, Zoro, Abdullah and Jeet without tiring as he scaled Pica's massive golem before someone noticed.

{"name": "Zunesha", "episode": "Episode 802", "chapter": "Chapter 751", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Zunesha is a gargantuan elephant, comparable to an island in sheer scale; its two-jointed legs are disproportionately and extremely long, such that it can walk on the sea floor while its upper body, including about a third of each leg, remains above the water. However, Zunesha has comparatively small eyes (shown to have turquoise, ringed irises in the anime) sunken deep into their sockets, being barely visible at most times and giving the impression that it has no eyes at all. Its gray skin is heavily wrinkled, reflecting its old age, and its ears are tattered and frayed at the edges.", "personality": "Most of Zunesha's personality is a mystery, but it does not mind carrying a civilization on its back, and in fact cares greatly about the Mink Tribe. As part of the sentence for whatever crime it committed in the past, Zunesha is not allowed to do anything but wander around, requiring permission from someone who can understand it to act against threats to its well-being. Miyagi speculates that Zunesha is not walking aimlessly and may, in fact, be looking for a certain location.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zunesha has immense longevity, given its so-far more than 1000 years of life. Due to its gigantic size, it can carry the whole island of Zou on its back, and as a result of its seemingly incredible endurance has been able to spend an entire millennium continuously carrying Zou whilst walking. Zunesha can suck up and expel massive amounts of sea water, and with it lots of fish, using its trunk. With a single swing of its trunk, it can wipe out entire fleets of ships and swiftly defeated Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates. Zunesha has extraordinary eyesight and can see faraway objects in great detail. However, due to having lived for so long, it is not very durable, so its weak and aged skin can be heavily damaged by concentrated cannon fire."},

{"name": "Zeus", "episode": "Episode 827", "chapter": "Chapter 786", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 844. He was first identified in Chapter 845.", "appearance": "Zeus normally appears as a large and light-colored cloud. When he caused a storm, he becomes dark and produces yellow lightning crackles (pink in the anime while controlled by Big Mom, yellow in the anime while controlled by Nami). He also wears a striped red and blue (red and white in the anime) baseball cap with a yellow brim on his head. He usually has a carefree, sleepy expression, but can take on a more sinister appearance. When he was initially described by Pound, he lacked the baseball cap and most of his facial features. After being sliced in half by Brook and then drained of electricity by Nami, Zeus's size was greatly reduced, enough to be held in one hand, and his face was enough to cover much of his body. During the raid on Onigashima, Zeus wore a blue kabuto helmet when he appeared alongside the other Straw Hats. After fusing with Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus's face can also appear in the middle of the Sorcery Clima-Tact's hilt, maintaining a dopey expression with blush marks. His face can also be transferred to the orange appendages at the end of the Clima-Tact whenever he causes them to grow, and he can also transfer his consciousness to the weather phenomena created by the Clima-Tact. However, he mainly continues to assume his cloud form.", "personality": "As one of her personal weapons, Zeus was very loyal to Big Mom and would come to her when she summoned him. Zeus also seemed to care about the safety of the citizens in Totto Land and hated to see them be tormented during Big Mom's rampages, but unlike his fellow homies, Zeus knew it was futile to try and reason with Big Mom when she is on one of her rampages. However, despite his loyalty, Zeus shares her extreme gluttony and particularly enjoys eating thunderclouds. Zeus was willing to disobey direct orders from Big Mom as long as Nami kept feeding him thunderclouds. However, he is capable of reason and learning from his mistakes, as he became very angry when Nami tried feeding him again, though his anger made him open to attack. His loyalty to Big Mom does not come before valuing his own life, as when Big Mom ordered Hera to consume him, he begged to be allowed to leave in peace rather than surrender his soul power to Hera. He went as far as to assist Nami after feeling betrayed by Big Mom, and was willing to attack his master as a means of apology towards Nami for his earlier betrayal. He is also extremely carefree, as after he became Nami's servant, he readily accepted it and found it comfortable to be stored inside her Clima-Tact.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zeus is far more powerful than normal homies, being made from a fragment of Big Mom's very own soul. This gives the cloud a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the Yomi Yomi no Mi's user. However, he can still be harmed by the user's attacks, as shown when Brook unleashed a powerful attack that sliced him in half, though Zeus was able to survive due to his composition. As a cloud, Zeus can fly, produce both normal and \"sweet rain\" (, Mizuame?), and attack with powerful bolts of lightning, strong enough to defeat Vinsmoke Judge in one hit. When combining powers with Prometheus, they can manipulate the weather to create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms. Like Prometheus, Zeus is mostly immune to physical attacks due to being an intangible cloud, even attacks imbued with Busoshoku Haki, being simply able to recombine his body. However, unleashing massive discharges weakens Zeus, decreasing his size until he can recharge by consuming electricity. It has also been shown that electricity-based attacks work well against Zeus due to his composition as a thundercloud; if someone unleashes electrical energy that combines with his, Zeus can be forced to unwillingly discharge his electricity, up to the point of harming his master Big Mom. Zeus' attacks being lightning-based also means certain characters can resist them without much issue, such as Monkey D. Luffy, whose body is made of insulating rubber, and Brook, who has no flesh to be harmed by electricity to begin with. He can also expand and serve as a seat for Big Mom, being made of more dense and tangible material similar to Sea Clouds. Zeus can also carry objects and people while flying, as seen when he transported Pudding and Sanji to the wedding venue and when he carried Big Mom to chase the Straw Hats, flying at incredible speeds, enough to catch up to the Straw Hats, who had a significant headstart, while carrying Big Mom. After his soul was transferred to Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus gained a wider breadth of abilities. He can manipulate the orange appendages on both ends and shape them as he pleases, having shown the ability to freely form it into weapons like a mace. This makes it similar to Napoleon's ability in manipulating the weapon's shape they inhabit. He can also inhabit weather phenomena that Nami generates from the Clima-Tact, allowing him to perform lightning-based attacks like he is used to if Nami generates a cloud using him. Although Zeus claims that his soul cannot leave the Clima-Tact without Big Mom's ability, he is seemingly able to exist in cloud form without being tethered to it. It is unclear whether he is limited to a certain range."},
{"name": "Zeff", "episode": "Episode 43", "chapter": "Chapter 20", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "While still a pirate, Zeff had short blonde-hair, which was somewhat unkempt, a mustache that he tied with light blue ribbons on each end, and a slight stubble. 22 years before the story, he wore a simple red-and-white vertical stripped shirt with gold buttons on the collar. By the time he raided the Orbit, he changed to a purple and red, horizontally stripped overall and braided his mustache. In either case, he wore dark pants with a light green pirate's sash and a captain's coat draped over his shoulders like a cape. When he became the head chef of Baratie and was teaching Sanji his chivalry, his moustache has not been braided as it is seen in the current timeline and his goatee has also been shaved off. As the head chef of Baratie, Zeff is an elderly-looking man who still retains his blonde-colored hair, which he keeps underneath his extra-long chef's hat. His mustache has grown considerably long, and he grew a beard. He wore his chefs uniform, with a blue ascot, and white apron. Also, since he lost his right leg, he has a peg leg and he seems to have no trouble walking with it. After two years, he wears a horizontally striped dark colored and light colored shirt, dark colored pants, and a white chefs uniform draped over his shoulders, with his ascot. He still has the same braided mustache style, and peg leg.", "personality": "Zeff was a tough former pirate. He is hard on those around him and is always serious (at times appearing frighteningly serious) about everything. Zeff normally does not show emotions other than a hot temper and has a firm hold of authority at the Baratie. Despite his fierce temper, Zeff is also very compassionate. When he and Sanji were shipwrecked on a rocky island at sea, he chose to hand over all the remaining food supply to Sanji, keeping none to himself.Due to his great compassion, Sanji even believed that Zeff wouldbe completely disgusted with him if Sanji had chosen to abandon his biological family to die by Big Mom's hands and even laugh at their demise despite how corrupt his family was along with the fact they had coerced Sanji by threateningZeff's safety. As a chef at sea, Zeff respects food to a very high degree. When he ordered his crew to plunder the Orbit, he kicked one of his crew for stealing food, the one thing he refuses to take. Also, when Sanji was still in-training at the Baratie, when his food was unsatisfactory for customers, Zeff forced Sanji to eat it himself, rather than throw it out. He also gave Krieg food for his starving crew, understanding the pain of hunger at sea, despite knowing that feeding the crew would bring a battle. At one point, Zeff stated that he disliked children. Whether this is true of him, or whether it was simply made up to persuade Sanji to join the Straw Hats remains to be seen; however, given his father-son relationship with Sanji, he certainly appears to have made the latter the exception to this aspect about him. Zeff also strongly dislikes any violence against women. For this reason, he refuses to hire any female chefs, as he tends to make his point in the kitchen using violence. He made it a point to pass this onto Sanji, insisting that men can never harm women no matter what.", "abilities_and_powers": "When Zeff was a pirate, he was renowned for being both a great chef and a powerful pirate captain who managed to traverse the Grand Line. Zeff also retains a fair amount of knowledge of the Grand Line and piracy from his days as captain, as displayed when he knew about \"The Hawk-Eyes Man\" that Gin was talking about, and the fact that he knew some people referred to the first half of the Grand Line as Paradise. He also knows perfectly well about Devil Fruits and the weaknesses that come with them. He is a highly capable teacher as he could pass on most of his fighting skills onto Sanji."},
{"name": "Zeo", "episode": "Episode 611", "chapter": "Chapter 530", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "As a Wobbegong shark, Zeo is a tall and thin fish-man with a strange body, covered in wavy light blue and indigo stripes, and \"02\" tattooed on his chest. Tentacle-like whiskers hang from his face, and unlike other fish-men, Zeo does not seem to have ears nor a nose, nor does he have a visible mouth. However, as he is able to speak, listen, and consume Energy Steroids, it is obvious that he has them. He sports a dorsal fin, and gills on his long neck. His legs are covered by what appears to be some sort of long inducement, with a pattern identical to his body's and the New Fish-Man Pirates' Jolly Roger in correspondence of his right knee. Around his waist is a belt with a round buckle, and his feet seem to be covered by dark boots. As a teenager, he looked almost identical, with the only differences being the smaller size, the lack of the number tattoo on his chest, not having the gill marks on the side of his neck yet, the simpler belt around his waist and the pair of loose pants he wore back then. Due to the negative effects of the Energy Steroids, his body became old and weak. He now sports a white beard resembling his tentacles, bushy eyebrows,a skinnier crooked neck,and something of a pot belly.", "personality": "Zeo has a calm and serious demeanor and appears to be one of the most intellectual members of Hody's crew, as he was responsible for the mass-production of the Energy Steroids, and also behind swaying Wadatsumi to their cause. Like his colleagues, he believes humans are cowardly creatures. Zeo also despises humans and Otohime's ideals as much as Hody Jones and the other officers. Zeo appears vicious using threats to force the Fish-Man Island citizens to comply with the New Fish-Man Pirates and accept that they can never co-exist peacefully with humans. His hatred is intense, and he believed that even if they died in failure, they can leave a grudge against humanity for the next generation of fish-men to pick up, and stood by his beliefs by forcing the lower echelons to remain behind to die, even using deadly force to achieve this. Naming himself the Noble of the Fish-Man District, he seems to be overly committed to the morals of the Fish-Man District. Even after being beaten by his subordinates (unintentionally) he still kept preaching about how their views of Otohime were wrong. He also expressed great happiness and pride when he thought that he defeated Brook. Zeo's arrogance is so deep to where he stubbornly makes excuses whenever he is humiliated and gets angered easily when corrected on his mistakes, such as when Brook accidentally stepped on his face due to his camouflage only to claim he was \"headbutting\" the latter's foot. Later, after getting stabbed, he claims it was his plan to dull the blade. He showed it again after he (along with the other officers) grew old from the effects of the Energy Steroid, claiming that he grew old on purpose.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Zeo has command over lower ranking subordinates.

Her most striking feature is probably the over-exaggerated way she walks, describing hip swings that are often used to display a sexy woman. Outside of Baroque Works, when first introduced in the Spiders Cafe, Zala is shown donning yellow crystal square glasses and a diamond-patterned bandanna that combines a variety of pink, turquoise, white and purple tones. She is also shown wearing a tank-top; purple in color, with pink embroideries drawn across it and green ornaments that resemble some kind of bushes representations. She wears dark brown low-riding pants, platform sandals, and has her long, dark blue hair tied back in a ponytail. Later on, Zala is seen donning her most characteristic outfit; revealing and dark brown in color, this outfit mainly consists of a short long-sleeved jacket with beige colored fur brims, a bikini top describing an unusual spider web-like pattern across her abdominal area, low-riding pants, and platform sandals. She is sometimes seen smoking from a long whitish pipe. During Miss Goldenweek's \"Operation: Meet Baroque Works\", Zala wore the typical striped prisoner outfit, which covered from the upper part of her torso to her thighs, dark footwear and large handcuffs.", "personality": "Zala is Mr. 1's calm and mild tempered partner who has a funny way of walking, over-exaggerating the \"sexy\" hip swing. She is not easily amused by the antics of others and remains unweathered in any situation. She also displays a tendency to play with her victims; during her fight with Nami she took her time in dealing with her, only really going after her when she finally lost her patience at Nami's apparently \"useless\" weapon. She is nonetheless a lethal fighter who does not shy away from violence, much like her partner Mr. 1. She has, however, shown small hints of mercy, as she told Nami that she would kill her as painlessly as possible if she surrendered. She also stated several times during the battle that she feels bad for Nami, because she was stuck with a weapon that appeared to have no use, but it didn't stop her from going after Nami. Zala is also shown to be brave, compared to the rest of herformer colleagues. For example,despite the fact that any potential risk for her safety could have been provoked,she decided to directly ask Crocodile about his objective after the latter had revealed his public identity while Mr. 1, Mr. 2, Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmasremained intimidated by their boss' presence.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zala is shown to be a fairly skilled fighter even though she mostly relies on the advantages provided by her Devil Fruit. She is shown to be somewhat ruthless and certainly feels no sympathy towards her victims; although she is less serious than her partner, going so far as to display amused confidence in her fights. Her skills are, however, great enough to bepartneredwith Mr. 1, granting her the second highest ranking female officer agent title inBaroque Works, being bested only byMiss All-Sunday."},

She also wears a light-colored jacket over her top, a pair of bikini bottoms, dark gloves, large dark boots that go up past her knees, and a pair of goggles on her forehead. When she eats a lot, she becomes immensely obese, but can instantly return to her original figure after going to the bathroom.", "personality": "Being designated the greed satellite of Vegapunk, York is a very gluttonous and lazy individual. Her primary task seems to be to eat, sleep, and relieve herself for the other satellites so they can perform their own duties unimpeded. She seems to have a vapid personality with her head in the clouds, rarely speaking except for yawning or remarking about sleeping or eating, but wantonly approached a dangerous Seraphim because she found it cute. However, this was later shown to be a faade. In truth, York is a highly selfish schemer who possesses lofty ambitions, willing to betray her fellow Vegapunks solely for the chance to become a World Noble. She believes that only one Vegapunk is necessary in the world and is not against eliminating her peers if needed, betraying the Satellites' purpose of ensuring Stella's safety even at the cost of their lives. York also shows no signs of mercy or remorse should casualties arise due to her actions, as she was willing to accept all of them should it serve her ultimate goal. When defeated, York is shown to be quite cowardly, spiteful and insensitive.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a satellite of Vegapunk, York has likely been a contributor to the genius scientists numerous technological developments. She is responsible for eating, sleeping and defecating on behalf of all the other satellites. As such, she consumes large quantities of food to the degree of attaining a BMI of 600 (20 times the amount considered obese), expels the waste, and sleeps for their sakes, doing so multiple times per day, but this does not seem to negatively affect her body. In spite of her rather passive role as a scientist, York is very cunning, deceptive, manipulative and skilled at keeping a low profile, having orchestrated most of the incidents that have happened during the Egghead Arc without ever arousing suspicion of herself or being detected by either Vegapunk or the other satellites. This includes prior, arc-leading events such as contacting the Five Elders about Vegapunk's history research or kidnapping several Cipher Pol agents multiple times, occurrences even Vegapunk admitted he was completely unaware of. York is capable of replicating the Mother Flame, which makes her valuable to the World Government. York is also a skilled gunwoman, having shot Shaka in the head with a simple, ordinary pistol (albeit a very large one, befitting her size) and from a considerable range."},

However, when he was first seen, he did not have a tattoo on his face and he was wearing a pirate hat, instead of a cowboy hat.", "personality": "Yorki was shown to be very carefree and light-hearted. He was seen teasing his crew when they fought over a trivial matter. He was shown to be a selfless captain when he told the crew to leave him, worrying that the crew would catch his disease. Unlike a typical pirate captain, the only prerequisite Yorki had for being a member of his crew was that you must love music. He stated it was the objective of his crew to make children smile, and with the exception of his illness, was rarely seen not smiling himself.

His arms have become very muscular.", "personality": "When he is with Johnny, the pair often stand together side by side, with one arm across the chest and the other at their mouths. While like this, their voices and behavior become serious, however in truth, they are very silly and emotional. Yosaku is the more emotional of the pair and he can spend hours crying over stories of difficult times and struggles. He tends to get frustrated and even upset when no one pays attention to him when talking. Like Johnny, he has a fair amount of knowledge regarding rumors and the world but lacks the finer details. He was partly blamed by Zoro for their misinformation over \"Hawk-Eyes\" and \"Drunk-Eyes\". He prefers to avoid danger like Johnny, but unlike Johnny, he quickly forgets his fears if distracted by something else like food or by being moved by a story linked to the fear. When he is spurred on, he is brave enough to go against Arlong and his crew and wise enough to know that if they did not stand a chance against Arlong and his crew the villagers they made suffer would be slaughtered. One quirk he shares with Johnny, perhaps out of pride, is always stating that any fight he loses, he lost only by a hair.", "abilities_and_powers": "Yosaku is a swordsman like Johnny, however they are relatively low in strength and power. As for example when they tried to take on the Arlong Pirates by themselves they were easily overpowered. He and Johnny are inexperienced with traveling by sea as proven when Yosaku fell ill to scurvy. However, he and Johnny are fairly knowledgeable about the world at large, such as information on the existence of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Arlong Pirates; he even identified Momoo as a Grand Line monster upon first glance when the Sea Cow confronted the boat that he, Luffy and Sanji were on, hinting some degree of experience. They are, however, still incompetent and have been known to slip up, as when they reported Hawk-Eyes had been reported at the Baratie when it was actually \"Drunk-Eyes\"."},

He has three circular badges with dark-colored stars on them, two on the right of his coat, one on the left. He also has a belt strapped diagonally across his chest where he carries a sword. He wears metal greaves on his legs.", "personality": "Yarisugi is a harsh and violent Marine, fitting the image of the G-5 branch where he works. Uncompassionate and unsympathetic, he kicked one of the citizens who was begging him to help find their children and even went as far as threatening the depressed citizens outright. He also tends to exaggerate things, saying, \"too\" in almost every sentence. Like most of the other G-5 Marines, Yarisugi enjoys torturing pirates. After Jinbe left Caribou at the G-5 base, Yarisugi quickly started coming up with ideas on how to torture him in the cruelest manner possible.

{"name": "Yamato", "episode": "Episode 971", "chapter": "Chapter 972", "year": 2020, "note": "He was first mentioned by Kaidou in Chapter 977. His name was revealed by Kaidou in Chapter 979.", "appearance": "Being assigned female at birth and not usually choosing to explicitly present as male, Yamato has typically been referred to as a woman by people when they first encounter him. Yamato is taller than an average human, standing at 263 cm (8'8\"). He has long, white hair that is bound between orange rods into a ponytail at the back, which fades into aqua green and then blue the further down it goes, and ends in rectangular locks similar to Kaidou. Yamato also has large, orange eyes with prominent eyelashes, wears gold hoop earrings on both ears, and has horns on the top of his head which are mostly red, but gradually become more flesh-colored toward the base. Yamato's current outfit is a sleeveless white garment with a diamond-shaped design on both sides and an indigo, wisp-patterned bottom half. He wears a pair of red hakama pants and sandals, and, much like Oden, wears a large purple and white nio-dasuki behind his back. While in disguise, Yamato originally also wore a hannya mask, which has a blue wig with an extremely long and wild mane attached to the top and a long blue goatee attached to the bottom. The kimono initially had long white sleeves, but were ripped off along with the rest of the disguise making Yamato's kimono more form-fitting. Four years ago, Yamato wore a similar long-sleeved outfit, but with different symbols near the breasts. The symbols resemble an oden skewer. At age 8, Yamato's outfit was nearly identical to today, except with a slightly different mask with shorter horns and beard and without the nio-dasuki. In the manga this outfit lacked the diamond-shaped design.", "personality": "Yamato greatly admires the legendary samurai Kozuki Oden to the point of even proclaiming to carry his identity. Yamato has self-identified as Oden on multiple occasions and has even emulated his gender, proclaiming to be the son of Kaidou due to Oden being a man. Although initially carrying doubts as to how to present as Oden, Yamato has steadily expressed a straightforward attitude regarding this identity as time has gone on, even proclaiming this as such to Oden's son Momonosuke, to the boy's horror. Although having wholeheartedly embraced this identity, Yamato retains his original persona, referring to Yamato as his \"other name\". Yamato does not seem to like being misnamed, having quickly corrected Luffy when given a nickname. Having read of the great exploits documented by Oden in his logbook, which he considers his \"bible\", Yamato dreams of leaving Wano Country's confines and setting out to sea with the Straw Hat Pirates, much like Oden did with the Whitebeard and Roger Pirates decades before. Yamato also wishes to fulfill the goals that Oden had, namely opening Wano's borders, in direct defiance to Kaidou's wishes for the country. Yamato has shown to be extremely strong-willed, having put up considerable resistance to Kaidou's imprisonment despite taking decades to finally break free. Although initially seeming to be more subordinate to him previously, Yamato's battle with Ace led to him destroying Kaidou's dragon statue in an act of defiance that has since led to more outright rebellion. Yamato has engaged in combat with Kaidou numerous times and has openly expressed opposition and defiance to his plans concerning the two of them, accompanied by insults. When the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance invaded Onigashima, Yamato was immediately willing to help them and had no qualms with attacking members of his father's crew, making his intentions and loyalty clear to them in the process. Yamato is also willing to go to great lengths to achieve his objectives, having basically kidnapped Luffy in order to get to talk to him and following through with this tactic even after Luffy responded by fighting back. Yamato is more than willing to put his body and life on the line to protect people out of care, believing that Oden would never abandon a comrade in danger. Yamato resolutely withstood a barrage of powerful artillery strikes by the Armored Division to protect Momonosuke, and later confronted Kaidou alone to stall him until Luffy returned despite knowing he was no match for his father. However, Yamato also takes enjoyment in engaging in combat; despite framing his plan to split up from Momonosuke as a decoy strategy to trick the Beasts Pirates, Momonosuke and Shinobu both noted to themselves that he seemed mainly interested in going to fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Yamato is an extremely powerful warrior, with Black Maria noting that bringing him back to Kaidou's fortress after he had escaped would be a difficult task. In the past, Yamato was able to clash against Ace, a powerful Logia user, on equal ground. Afterwards, Ace acknowledged Yamato's abilities, saying he could not believe someone so strong was not the captain and lamenting that he could not join his crew. During the Raid on Onigashima, Yamato clashed with Kaidou, a particularly notable feat considering the Emperor's nearly unparalleled physical might, with Kaidou himself acknowledging his son's strength and value as a soldier. Luffy also greatly respects Yamato's abilities, trusting him with protecting Wano after it became vulnerable to outside forces following Kaidou's defeat, despite wishing for Yamato to join his pirate crew."},

Over his toga he has an orange sash, connected by strings, and has red lining and dark orange vertical stripes on it. Yama wears gold bracelets on both his wrist, and has wings on his back, like other Birkans.", "personality": "Yama is fanatically loyal to Enel, going so far as to reprimand Shura, Ohm, and Gedatsu for fighting in his presence. He displays quite an amount of brutality in battle. His ruthless fighting style gives him little respect for the world around him, as seen when he destroyed the ruins of Shandora during his fight with Robin. He has a habit of often exclaiming \"Baa!\" and \"Meriya!\"", "abilities_and_powers": "Despite his massive build, Yama is very acrobatic, agile, and fast. His comparatively tiny limbs are very strong as well. He was able to simply kick an iron ball fired from Genbo's Bazooka back to him, and was able to smash right through the ruins of Shandora with ease. Aside from his crush and slice method, he also uses powerful punches, kicks, and normal body slams combined with acrobatics to inflict heavy damage, courtesy of his immense weight and figure."},
{"name": "X Drake", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Drake is a tall, lean, and muscular man who wears what appears to be a combination of a white-plumed cocked hat with his crew's Jolly Roger on the side and a domino mask over his eyes. Underneath this headgear, Drake's hair is reddish brown, with brush-like sideburns. On his broad chin he has an \"X\" (not confirmed to be either a scar or tattoo) and on his chest and upper body he also has another large \"X\". The \"X's\", as well as that in his name, represents the Roman Numeral X for 10, not the English letter. When seen from above, his bicorne greatly resembles the head of a Pterodactyl. He wears armor on his relatively thin legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows, respectively. The openings to both the gloves and the boots are also secured by the armor, which is rounded for the gloves and a sharp maple leaf pattern for the boots at the front of his knees. On the rest of his body, he wears leather pants and a leather shirt. A belt with a large ornately designed circular belt buckle secures Drake's pants as well as his sword and axe to his waist. He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a white fur lining around the neck. After the Summit War, he is seen wearing a scarf that is tied around his neck when he appeared on a winter island that was apparently under the protection of Kaidou. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Drake is shown wearing a small tattered Marine uniform, showing that he aspired to become a Marine since he was very young. He had a rounder face, shorter hair, and a wooden sword at his side. He did not have the \"X\" on his chin yet. He appears to have been a playful and cheerful boy, as opposed to the stern and serious man he grew up to be. As a young adult, Drake wore a tattered, bloodied shirt with pants and boots on the snowy Minion Island while with the Barrels Pirates, though later on during a supposed escape, he managed to acquire a somewhat tattered, thick winter coat with a hood as well as a pair of dark gloves. Due to the mental and physical abuse he suffered from his father, he was undersized for his age and easily mistaken as a child by the Donquixote Pirates. After the timeskip, Drake no longer has his bicorne, exposing his now light orange hair spiked into a fauxhawk. In place of his bicorne, he now has a black headband with an eyehole cut out of it and his crew's Jolly Roger next to the hole. The headband is slanted so it goes over his left eye, and a thin piece of cloth from it, presumably cut from the hole, is fitted over his right eye.", "personality": "In his childhood, Drake was a Marine enthusiast and deeply admired his father, Diez Barrels, who served the organization as an officer. When Barrels turned to piracy, Drake still thought of his father as a good man and kept following him. As a young man thirteen years ago, Drake appeared to be the reluctant, submissive type, obeying his father despite the abusive treatment he was given. Barrels once stated that despite his strength, Drake was a coward and rarely contributed to his crew's operations. Indeed, by that point, Drake ran away when the opportunity presented itself, displaying no loyalty to his family. In the present, Drake seemingly has not regretted this decision, holding no grudge towards the perpetrators of his father's death. In spite of the horrible treatment his father gave him, Drake still remains loyal to the Marines, putting his life at risk in order to infiltrate the crew of one of the Four Emperors. Even when presented with the threat of torture, Drake stated that he would rather die than reveal his true allegiance, only deciding to keep fighting because he still had a mission to accomplish. Drake is flexible with his beliefs of Justice as he is not picky about potential allies in criminals and outlaws, going as far as request to join forces with Monkey D. Luffy, an enemy of the World Government, just because of the Straw Hat's friendship with Koby, Drake's subordinate. A honorable man, Drake has declared that he intends to repay Luffy for accepting him as an ally in a time of need. Currently, Drake displays a stern, dead-serious disposition at all times. Patient and observant, he appears to be a pirate who avoids needless violence, aware that such a thing would attract unwanted attention. In fact, he may even intervene in fights where he is not involved at all, doing so in the middle of confrontation between Killer and Urouge in an attempt to pacify both of his fellow Super Rookies. However, when a situation calls for violence, Drake reveals a surprisingly ruthless and bloodthirsty streak. Trafalgar Law once implied that Drake had killed a significant amount of people in his career, reinforcing the notion that the former rear admiral is actually not opposed to conflict at all. Later, Drake fearlessly attacked a Pacifista head-on, employing a brutal biting attack in his Zoan form. Drake is bold enough to even challenge a subordinate of the Four Emperors, knowing full well that such an action would put him in the crosshairs of the Emperor himself. As one of the Tobiroppo, Drake is very much mission-oriented, always prioritizing the job assigned to him, although he might think his presence in certain tasks may be overkill, like assassinating the owner of a small noodle shop. This professionalism and dutifulness also extend to his job as a Marine spy, reporting everything of note that he ends up witnessing in his cover. Despite holding a high position in the Beasts Pirates, Drake self-admittedly has no interest in raising further in the ranks, unlike some of his fellow Tobiroppo. In spite of his generally serious attitude, Drake is known to sometimes lose his composure in certain situations. In particular, naked women easily fluster him to the point of fainting at the sight of one, making him wary of entering places like bathhouses. Nevertheless, he still denies this weakness even if it's obviously the case.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Marine Headquarters' secret special force, SWORD and the Drake Pirates, Drake has great authority over his subordinates. Even during his youth, he was the strongest member of the Barrels Pirates, and he later achieved the rank of Rear Admiral in the Marines, prior to his public defection. He is a member of the Worst Generation that survived one of the seven harsh and dangerous routes through Paradise, the first half of the Grand Line, earning a bounty of 220,000,000 before entering the New World. Despite his attack on a favorite island of the Emperor Kaidou, Drake survived the experience and made a greater name for himself. At some point during the two-year timeskip, he became one of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, holding a high position in the crew with authority over the lower-ranking members, before his treason was exposed and he left the crew. Drake is an extremely formidable combatant; he stopped a fight between two other Supernovas with just one move, effortlessly defeated a Super Rookie, and was one of the few pirates on the Sabaody Archipelago capable of injuring a Pacifista without outside help. According to Kozuki Sukiyaki, Drake single-handedly defeated the five samurai who guarded Amigasa Village, and destroyed the town. During the raid on Onigashima, Drake defeated the drunken ancient giant, Juki, with a single attack, and despite having lost his battle against CP0, his sheer toughness was still praised by Guernica. While a powerful person in his own right, he has a surprising weakness in that he becomes faint at the sight of a naked female."},

He has droopy eyes, regardless of his expression.", "personality": "Wire is taciturn and usually, he does not show any type of emotion, as he is often seen standing in the background with a mopish expression in his face.

He's covered by various tribal tattoos across his left shoulder and the left side of his face. He has very long dark brown hair is arranged in a mohawk that follows into a segmented braid that goes slightly past his waist, resembling those worn by real life Native Americans, and he has little spherical earrings. Wyper always goes shirtless, and is also shoeless beyond using Skate-type Wavers in battle. He generally wears a grass skirt, with a rope belt decorated by three small ornaments that look like fangs or claws around his waist. He is usually seen smoking a cigarillo, chomping down on it during battle, and as a child he chewed on a grass stalk before he moved up to tobacco, showing it is a definite habit of his. He also wore an intimidating tribal mask in his first appearance, but soon discarded it. After the timeskip he now wears his hair unbraided, appearing to have a full head of long hair past his shoulders. He also has the coat his fellow guards wear tied around his waist instead of actually wearing it.He also has a more muscular build. In the anime, Wyper's tattoos are intricately colored with green and red. However, in the manga and other related media, his tattoos are colored black.", "personality": "Inheriting the violent tendencies of his ancestor, Wyper is first shown to be an extremely violent and irrational man. He believes to follow the path of his ancestor and his principles. He does not easily trust outsiders and is quick to fight anyone without a second thought. Because of this, he is called a berserker. Despite this however, Wyper has a deep love for his people and his homeland. He also has a deep respect for his ancestor's best friend, Mont Blanc Noland, to whom he feels obligated to because of Noland's deeds, friendship to Kalgara, and unfortunate fate. In fact, it is Wyper's love for his people and his obligation to Noland that drives him. It is because of these that Wyper has taken responsibility to restore his people's home and put an ease to Noland's soul. While he means well, his determination sometimes tends to blind him thus causing Wyper to become more violent and push himself beyond his physical limits. He is, however, not completely heartless towards others. He realized Luffy's goal, although different, was alike to his own and is moved by his efforts. Both because of Luffy's actions during the battle with Enel and the need for fighting having been removed, Wyper seems to have now calmed down.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wyper is a notably powerful opponent and acted as the leader of the Shandia warriors tasked with fighting to take Upper Yard back from Enel, showcasing his skills as the Shandia tribe's strongest warrior at the time.

{"name": "Who's-Who", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "His name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978. He appeared shadowed in the anime in Episode 954.", "appearance": "Who's-Who is a very tall man at over 3.3 meters, lean yet well-toned with particularly long legs and a light complexion. A mane of wavy, pink-colored hair goes down his back a little past his waist, and a pair of long, upward-curving horns jut out of his head. A chain smoker, Who's-Who is always seen with a cigarette in his mouth. Like some of his subordinates, Who's-Who wears a mask over the top half of his head down over his nose, which comes centrally to a slightly raised edge and point. It is red in color and bears two horns (fitting over his natural horns) that are connected to the mask's sides by a circular base each. While Who's-Who's lower face remains bare, including his full-lipped mouth and square jaw, his ears are half-covered, with a golden hoop earring still visible on each, and his eyes obscured by large, yellow, circular coverings that do not seem to obstruct the man's vision. For his upper body, Who's-Who dons a plain, button-cuffed jacket colored the same red as the mask (paired with black gloves) over a black shirt with a double-winged collar, both unbuttoned to show off his chest and abdominals. The former is tattooed with two swirl-ended lines topping a stylized, thick-lashed eye motif, with his name below spelled \"WHO S WHO\", all in black color (dark-purple in the anime, with the S bolded). His lower wear consists of matching red, slim-fit pants held up by a wide, purple belt with a big, round, stud-lined gold buckle (bearing a yellow pinwheel shape in the middle), and lastly black dress shoes with single latchets buckled on each side. As a young child seen busy with martial arts training, Who's-Who wore simple dark pants with a flowing, light-colored sash and dark slip-ons, otherwise going shirtless; the upper half of his face was obscured by his wild hair in place of a mask. As an adult while a CP9 agent, 13 years ago, Who's-Who took to wearing a simple dark suit paired with a dark dress shirt, plus a tie of contrastively light color; like in his childhood, he wore his hair at neck length, his long bangs still hiding his eyes.", "personality": "Who's-Who tends to maintain a calm and serious disposition while around peers, like showing annoyance at their bickering. Somewhat ironically though, he has also shown himself to be loquacious at times, such as rambling on about his past while in the middle of a fight. An ambitious man, Who's-Who strives to become one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars by taking a spot from one of the current three, leading him to completely disregard their senior authority; this desire, according to King, stems from Who's-Who's past as captain of his own crew. In accordance, he has shown himself to be confident in his strength, believing it enough for him to kill an All-Star and smirking excitedly at the thought of gaining an opportunity to try. Further evidencing his self-confidence is Who's-Who's claim of having had the same potential as Rob Lucci, the strongest-ever CP9 agent. In battle, Who's-Who tends to be derisive toward enemies, openly laughing at their or their allies' predicaments. He also feels no need to honor the spirit of a fair fight, as he freely chose to gang up on Jinbe with his subordinates all the while mocking his foe about that very situation. What is more, Who's-Who has shown himself to be casually racist and ignorant of the history of other kinds of people, having remarked that Jinbe was fast \"for a fish-man\" fighting on land and also heavily correlating the fish-men race with slavery, with both remarks drawing ire from Jinbe. Due to his painful past, Who's-Who has grown spiteful toward anyone who reminds him of it, including the Straw Hat Pirates and, especially, Luffy due to the latter's indirect connection to said past. Amid his imprisonment starting over a decade ago, Who's-Who gained a vested interest in the legend of the so-called \"Sun God\" Nika, which a certain prison guard had told him about. Just like slaves of the long-distant past supposedly believed in said Sun God as a savior figure who would free and deliver them from suffering, Who's-Who himself became attached to the legend, due to his misery in jail and a wish for someone to save him. Even in the present time as a free man, Who's-Who remains interested in the myth, bluntly asking his enemy, Jinbe, in the midst of combat whether he knew of anything relating to Nika, on the flimsy assumption that he may do so because of fish-men's history with slavery and the Sun Pirates' symbol of the sun.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Who's-Who holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, only Kaidou himself and the All-Stars ranking above him. An ex-pirate captain, Who's-Who also commanded his own crew, the Who's-Who Pirates, before joining Kaidou. Before that, he had been a noteworthy member of the World Government's CP9 agency, implying a certain level of authority he must have held in it before his imprisonment. In combat, Who's-Who is very formidable, being one of the strongest members of an Emperor-led crew and potentially able to challenge the All-Stars for their positionsomething Who's-Who appeared confident in his ability to do. Among the Tobiroppo, he also has the highest bounty at 546,000,000, attesting to his power. Twelve years ago, before committing to piracy, Who's-Who was powerful enough to be considered, by his own word, a bright prospect among CP9 with the same potential as the genius Rob Lucci, who would grow to be the agency's most renowned superhuman assassin. In the present, Who's-Who has proven himself capable of holding his own in a fight against the ex-Warlord of the Sea, Jinbe, impressing the latter with his skill. He even gained the upper hand against the fish-man for a brief period, through a relentless barrage of attacks, though Jinbe in turn began overwhelming the Tobiroppo member shortly after and went on to defeat him with a single decisive blow. Who's-Who can also be rather strategic, leading his then-fellow Tobiroppo Drake into an ambush by using his own supposed feud with Queen as a pretext to convince the SWORD captain into following him."},

He has white fluffy hair and buck teeth, with spiral-designs on his cheek, and his eyes seem to extend off of his facewith his skin and eyelids as well. Wanze wears a black shirt unbuttoned, revealing his chest, a yellow scarf, black pants with an orange belt, and roller skates. The back of his jacket reads \"MAD\". On both his forearms, Wanze has tattooed the kanji  (kanji meaning \"fist\"?). He also wears a white chef's jacket with the World Government's symbol on its back, to which he removes prior to battle. After getting hit by Sanji's Parage Shot, Wanze's face is molded into something that resembles a stereotypical bishonen; ironically, he finds this form to be rather ugly. His face changes back to its former appearance after a kick to his torso from Sanji.", "personality": "Wanze is loud, obnoxious and explicitly annoying who often acts in a whimsical or uncontrolled manner, which is often done to goad his enemies into underestimating him and his abilities. As a master in Ramen Kenpo, Wanze also takes pride in his fighting style and acts confident in showing his enemies when he states that CP9 had chose him on the train to keep intruders out. However, he is a bit dense and can be short tempered. Furthermore, he oddly becomes dizzy when he sees spirals, such as Sanji's eyebrow. One of the main key features of Wanze is his constant facial expression (the \"dumb\" smile) that never changes even when he claims to be scared, which often annoys and provokes his enemies. However, he did get genuinely mad when Sanji changed him into a bishonen and claimed to be mutilated. Given his loyalty to the World Government and Cipher Pol, Wanze is an advocate for Absolute Justice and is naturally prejudiced against criminals that threaten them regardless of their character. As such he is not above slandering and disparaging Nico Robin over her infamous reputation much to Sanji's anger. Like other One Piece characters, Wanze has his own Laughter Style, starting it with \"Sa\" (i.e. Sasasasasasa!).

During the Drum Island arc, he used to dress in tin-plate armor and a hooded cape made from White Walkie skin. He was also wearing brown thick gloves. He spotted a pair of purple and orange woolen shorts and a brown belt around his waist and a pair of thick short boots. When he was the ruler of the Drum Peak, he was wearing the same attire but the tin-plate armor. Instead he was wearing a grey shirt and his gloves had no fur on their upper edge. After the timeskip, as the monarch of the Black Drum Kingdom he spots a different attire. He wears another shirt and when it comes to his lower body, he wears a skirt with a black pattern, a pair of black sharp pointy sandals. He still has his hooded cape and he wears black gloves. His hair is now white and he has grown a black mustache and a goatee.", "personality": "Wapol was once a prince of the region who succeeded his father, a King beloved by the people of Drum, as monarch when his father died. Wapol however, proved to be a spoiled and corrupt king, who held not even the slightest regard for his people. He was also cowardly and disloyal, fleeing his kingdom without even fighting back when the Blackbeard Pirates attacked, taking with him the doctors and soldiers while leaving his remaining subjects to fend for themselves. His self-centered actions ruined the kingdom's reputation, which caused all the citizens to both fear and hate him. He ruled simply to satisfy his selfish desires and he brutally beat anyone who disobeyed him. He was callous towards his people and never appears to care for their safety. Wapol loved to dominate over others with his family's power and wealth, and truly believed that none should dare question his authority. Wapol in particular has little to no understanding of politics or governmental issues, foolishly believing that everything is fine as long as it does not affect his kingdom directly. Being used to having everything go his way, he was childish enough to attack 10 year-old Nefertari Vivi, in the hopes of instigating a full-scale war, simply for being scolded by her father for being irresponsible, and grew furious when she did not blame him for this act of spite. Perhaps because of his selfish nature to desire what he wants, Wapol is unable to learn from his mistakes, as even though he lived as a homeless man and was forced to make a living by selling toys, he made an enormous fortune and became just as selfish and arrogant as he was while as king. In fact, he is one to hold grudges, as he only intended to attend Levely solely so he could get revenge on Dalton for becoming the new ruler of his old Kingdom, however he does not appear to bear a grudge against Luffy, as he mentioned that the latter's actions allowed him to regain power and a new kingdom. Despite so, he has become more considerate as despite disliking Cobra, he is horrified to find him unreasonably assassinated by the Five Elders simply for learning Imus existence. After escaping with Vivi, he also did not immediately divulge what he saw due to her father being killed which he knew would be difficult for her to accept. Though Wapol may look and act foolishly, he is by no means stupid, as demonstrated when he saw through Nami's lies and managed to figure out an effective, though cruel and corrupt method of controlling the citizens. Before Wapol's ascension to power, the Drum Kingdom possessed the most numerous and skilled doctors in all of the Grand Line. He took the twenty most skilled for himself while banishing or murdering the rest, to ensure that his subjects would be absolutely loyal and grovel at his feet for medical attention. He is also not foolish enough to defy the World Nobles. Despite his previous belief that the World Government would ensure that the Revolutionaries would be unable to harm him or his kingdom, he knew the consequences of stumbling onto the secret holder of the Empty Throne, casting aside any delusion that he is safe from harm so long as he is affiliated with the organization. Wapol is very gluttonous, which he takes to the extreme with his Devil Fruit powers. He eats as he pleases, non-stop, and caused massive collateral damage to cities which led him to be arrested once. He also has a habit of saying kaba (\"hippo\") instead of saying baka (\"idiot\"). This, along with his spoiled and childish personality, makes him a somewhat comedic villain, despite his cruelty. He also seems willing to use cannibalism, as seen when he attempted to eat Luffy and later, in Drum, after hearing from Kuromarimo that Doctor Kureha lives in his castle, he said he was going to eat her. Wapol has a unique face-fault when left utterly dumbstruck once something terrible happens at his expense- a very wide-eyed blank stare with veins bulging out of his eyes, coupled with a stupefied smile, giving off an overall look that suggests he is about to snap in a psychotic rage. He does have a sense of caution when he tells Nefertari Vivi to pipe down since there are many Den Den Mushi in the World Economy News Paper's blimp. Like many characters in One Piece, Wapol has a distinct laugh: starting with either \"Ma\" or a long \"Ma\" (i.e Mahahahahaha!/Maaaaaahahahahaha).", "abilities_and_powers": "As king of the Black Drum Kingdom, Wapol has full authority over the kingdom and its citizens, and is able to attend Levely. He formerly possessed this authority on Drum Island before he fled and was eventually deposed."},
{"name": "Wanda", "episode": "Episode 804", "chapter": "Chapter 753", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Wanda is a tan-furred, orange-haired, curvaceous and well-endowed canine mink with dog ears, a dog-like snout, and a large bushy tail. When first meeting Luffy's group, Wanda wore Nami's long blue jeans, high-heeled boots, and green-white striped bikini top after Nami lent them to her. Wanda also wears the Musketeer's blue cape and another blue cloth tied around her jeans. During the Beasts Pirates's invasion, Wanda wore a light blue open-necked shirt, white jeans shorts, calf-height brown boots and a white cavalier hat. After arriving at Wano Country, Wanda switched to a pink-colored kimono. As a child, Wanda had shorter hair, a smaller snout, and wore a light pink dress, magenta shoes, and the Musketeer's blue cape.", "personality": "Wanda is unprejudiced and judges others by who they are rather than by what they look like. She is helpful to strangers, having assisted the Straw Hat Pirates by giving them directions on Zou and protected Monkey D. Luffy from the guardians of the Whale Forest. She sometimes says things without considering their context. When she affectionately referred to Brook as a corpse, the Straw Hat Pirates thought she was talking about the dead body of one of their crewmates. However, she can be extremely emotional at times, which can affect her judgement. One instance is when she immediately attacked the Straw Hats after mistaking them for members of the Beasts Pirates upon sight, due to the emotional trauma they inflicted upon her and her people, but then calmed down after Pedro explained the situation. Similar to a dog, she has a habit of licking the faces of others as a way of displaying affection, as demonstrated when she licked Luffy's face on two separate occasions. Also, like most canine minks, she finds Brook to be delicious because his body is comprised exclusively of bones.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wanda holds a great deal of respect among her fellow minks, such that Pedro immediately had the Guardians withdraw from their confrontation with Monkey D. Luffy when she asked him to do so."},

He is large enough to make the giant-sized Shirahoshi and Megalo look like a regular-sized mermaid and shark. His round head and chest are quite big in comparison to his arms and legs. His hands are webbed. He has a big, round face, with a large mouth full of massive, round teeth quite distant from one another, and child-like eyes. He has some stubble on his chin and dark hair surrounding his head, taking the shape of a protrusion pointing upward at the top, which also covers a part of his shoulders. His whole body is also quite hairy. He apparently wears a pair of extremely loose pants paired with a dark indument tied around his waist, and has been seen walking barefoot. His overall shape, size, and eyes strongly resemble that of Sanjuan Wolf's. Due to his appearance, Wadatsumi was incorrectly called an Umibozu by Usopp. Members of the New Fish-Man Pirates also refer to him as such.", "personality": "He is loyal and obedient, following Decken's every command without question. Despite his huge size, his personality appears to be childlike, mirrored by his extremely childlike voice in the anime. Believing Decken has abandoned him, Wadatsumi cried and complained, but recovered when he was deceived into thinking he misheard, showing that Wadatsumi is nave and gullible. Contrary to the nasty reputation and behavior of his crew and captain, Wadatsumi seems to be more of a gentle and kind nature, as he destroyed two towns only due to sheer carelessness, which he apologized for in a genuinely remorseful manner, and cheerfully celebrated with the citizens upon resolving the situation. Another example was at Whole Cake Island, where after he reunited with some of the Straw Hat crew, Wadatsumi apologized for the trouble he gave them before at Fish-Man Island.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his great size, and the fact that he is a fish-man, he is extremely powerful. He hurt Ankoro, a fish several times the size of the Thousand Sunny, with a single punch despite not meaning to. He is also capable of picking up, carrying, and throwing entire buildings. He helped Jinbe transport an enormous and heavy poneglyph. Because of his size, he can easily create disturbances in the water; simply bursting out of the sea in the middle of the Big Mom Pirates' fleet was enough to send several ships flying into the distance. As a fish-man, he is capable of breathing underwater as well as surviving the crushing pressure of 10,000 meters below sea level. Being a tiger blowfish fish-man, he is also capable of inflating himself, thus increasing his already enormous size. After taking an Energy Steroid, his great strength increases further by being able to defeat Surume with one blow. He also has high stamina, taking powerful strikes from Jinbe and Sanji respectively and only slightly complaining about the pain."},

His hands are disproportionately large for his body and have a tattoo on the back of them that matches the one on his forehead. He has black hair that is slicked back and sticks up in a curl on the back of his head. In the anime, his skin is rather pale. Like most members of the crew, he wears a magenta suit coupled with a yellow cravat and a black coat draped over his shoulders. His coat has a feathered collar and his eyes are covered by a pair of small round sunglasses. He also has a pair of holsters where he keeps his eponymous 'Monster Guns', a pair of large revolvers.", "personality": "Vito is a man who treats his superiors with respect, making sure to let others know about the kind of people they're dealing with. Despite his high regard for his bosses, he recognizes that their actions are often quite cruel and selfish, and expresses a measured degree of sympathy for those negatively impacted by them. This is best shown when he gave Sanji a photo of his bride-to-be, in order to soften the blow of his forcefully arranged marriage. Vito is a big fan of the Germa 66, consistently profusing his admiration for the group and holding its members in high regard. Vito is talkative and has a tendency to follow people around, even when they do not desire his company. He also has a tendency to put people off with his mannerisms, especially when his tongue is involved. He is also compassionate, as he readily helped Sanji by ambushing Bobbin, despite Sanji's previous rude and disrespectful attitude towards him. Vito also specifically explained to Sanji the consequences of refusing to participate in Big Mom's Tea Party so the latter would be more careful in choosing to refuse. While helping Chiffon search for her twin sister Lola at Dressrosa, Vito lend a helping hand to citizens who were mysteriously attacked. He has a tendency to finish his sentences with \"rero\", the onomatopoeia for licking. Like many other people, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Nyororo\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the advisor of the Fire Tank Pirates, Vito likely holds some authority within the crew and is respected among the other members."},

As such, his head, body, and arms are composed of metal parts, with his hands being a set of metal claws. On the other hand, the digitally colored manga shows that his neck and face also appear to be made from metal, but are skin-colored, as opposed to the metal color of his body. Furthermore, Vitan also wears a metal hat and a pair of gray, possibly metal pants with a green sash around it. In his original sketch, Vitan had less of a robotic look, but instead appeared to be wearing some sort of garment with frills in the center.", "personality": "Vitan is very loyal to Whitebeard since he was willing to risk his own life to follow the orders of the Emperor to rescue Portgas D. Ace. Likewise, this highlights that Vitan highly treasures friendship because he charged straight into battle alongside other captains to save their comrade. Furthermore, his willingness to challenge Marine Headquarters shows that he is a bold pirate that refuses to back down no matter the situation.", "abilities_and_powers": "Vitan is a fearsome pirate who has managed to achieve an infamous reputation in the New World. As a cyborg, his robotic body is capable of serving as a form of stronger defense than the average human skin. Furthermore, his robotic hands are far superior than a human's in terms of arm strength, which means that it is likely to be an asset during combat since he was not seen charging into battle with any sort of weapon."},

When she was pregnant with her quadruplet sons, Sora had longer hair, pink lipstick,and she wore a white short-sleeved dress with frills and pink shoes.", "personality": "Sora was a very kind and caring woman, with great strength of character. She loved her children and was fiercely protective of them, believing that they should grow up with normal human emotions and not as cold killing machines. As a result, she did everything in her power to resist her husband's experiments on their sons, to the point of sacrificing her own life. Sora deeply cherished compassion and doted in particular on Reiju and Sanji, the only two of her children to exhibit empathy and compassion, in order to encourage these traits.

He also wears light blue pants with a belt that holds two sword sheaths, one on each side. He wields two sabers, one in each hand. During Ace's flashbacks, he was shown with shorter hair and wore different attire, consisting of some sort of open jacket and his trademark hat. He did not wear gloves then. He also appeared much slimmer and less muscular than he currently is. Vista was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates 22 years ago and had his trademark mustache and top hat then as well. When Vista was a little boy, he wore his hair in a ponytail, and had bangs that hung in his forehead. He sported a black shirt, with a white collar and cross designs on either side of the chest. He also had black pants, and black shoes. He was seen holding a wooden training sword, practicing his swordsmanship skills.", "personality": "Like all division commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, Vista seems to be very loyal to Whitebeard. He also seems to be modest. He expressed a desire to fight Dracule Mihawk and was happy that he got to cross blades with him. He also expressed a great hatred for Blackbeard as when he mocked Whitebeard's inability to save his crewmate, Vista had to be held back from attacking him.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the 5th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Vista has authority over the lower-ranking members of the crew. He has also been stated to be the strongest swordsman of the Whitebeard Pirates. He is a very experienced veteran, as he was shown as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger. He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as commander. He was the one individual Marco specifically commanded and entrusted Luffy's protection to. Even Dracule Mihawk acknowledges his reputation. Another indication of Vista's strength is that during the Summit War of Marineford, despite having fought against individual Warlords of the Sea and admirals as well as numerous Marine officers, he sustained no significant injuries."},

She wears her long, slightly wavy dark brown hair pulled back and held in place by a rose, with a lock hanging to the left of her face. This rose is actually used to conceal a hidden dagger.She seems to be well known with her beauty, even by people outside of her country. Along with the red rose on her hair, she wears round earrings, purple stiletto heels, and a long, sleeveless white Flamenco dress with violet polka dots and maroon frills. At age 19, ten years before joining the Donquixote Pirates, Viola wore her hair in a side-parted, chin-length bob with a pink hairband. She was wearing a long dress with a black top and a light and frilly bottom. As a child, Viola was seen wearing dresses with puffy shoulders, and her hair was in a shorter, rounded bob. After Donquixote Doflamingo was defeated and she regained her status as a princess, Viola wore a long fuchsia dress with white frills, and brings the hair in a ponytail. At the end of the Dressrosa Arc, Viola wore a long dark blue dress with white frills, and brings the hair in a ponytail. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Viola wore a light purple blouse, a dark purple long skirt with white frills, light purple pumps, and a red rose on her hair. During the Levely Arc, Viola wore a red violet dress with white frills, matching pumps, and a red rose on her hair. She had two necklaces and a cream white long cardigan over her shoulders.", "personality": "When playing the role of Violet, an officer of the Donquixote Family, Viola fits the stereotype of the dancing women of Dressrosa; she seems to be very emotional and romantic but would not hesitate to stab a man who betrays her. She can use her charm to manipulate people, persuading Sanji to kill a man for her and luring him into a trap. She has no qualms about using violence when necessary, as shown when she kicked Sanji full-force in the face, leaving him bleeding and barely conscious. Her ruthless behavior is actually a symptom of a profound cynicism; not a single man she has ever been involved with has been honest with her, a fact that her powers allowed her to discover. Deep down, she has a kind heart that was moved by Sanji's honesty and kindness, leading her to help him in spite of the consequences. The true Viola is nobler than her alias Violet, as she sacrificed her own freedom in order to spare her father's life. She never felt true loyalty to any king but her father. Even while working for the Donquixote Family, she kept tabs on the Tontattas' progress without revealing their plans to Doflamingo. Prior to her family's dethronement, Viola showed a more amiable and trusting personality, trying to persuade her sister to trust Kyros despite his background.", "abilities_and_powers": "Viola is a very graceful flamenco dancer. She is skilled in manipulating others and, as an assassin of the Trebol Army held in high regards, is an accomplished fighter. Her combat ability was demonstrated when she was able to severely wound Sanji, although comparing their respective strengths is somewhat pointless, given that he would die before fighting back. As the princess of Dressrosa, she has great authority over the country, a status that was taken away when her family was dethroned by Doflamingo until his defeat. As a former officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had command over the 2000 soldiers."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Reiju", "episode": "Episode 826", "chapter": "Chapter 783", "year": 2016, "note": "", "appearance": "Reiju is a slim young woman with shoulder-length light pink hair (darker pink in the anime), covering her right eye and curling upwards at the tips. She also has purple eyes (blue in the anime), and occasionally wears light pink lipstick. Like all the Vinsmoke siblings, she has distinctive curly eyebrows that form a spiral resembling the number \"6\". However, unlike her brothers Sanji and Yonji, her eyebrows appear to swirl symmetrically in opposing directions. Both of her thighs are tattooed with a number \"6\", referring to the name of the organization \"Germa 66\". When commanding the forces of Germa 66, Reiju wears a raid suit, comprising a light pink dress with a split in the center going down to her stomach and her navel, and covered by gold target-shaped symbolsreferences to the number \"0\" (Rei) in her name. She also wears dark pink gauntlets, a blue ascot, a pair of black headphones with the number \"66\" on them, and a patterned purple and black cloak shaped like the wings of a moth. Outside of her raid suit, Reiju has been shown wearing a skinny purple headband in her hair, a short white satiny dress with a frilled neckline and a pink cravat, and dark high heels. For formal functions, she also wears a red, thigh-length royal cape that is clasped in front of her neck. In the Whole Cake Chateau infirmary, Reiju wore a white frilled dress shirt, a dark thong, and a bandage wrapped around her left leg. During the Tea Party, Reiju changed into a short, sleeveless dress with a frilled V-neckline, as well as dark tights that reach halfway up her thighs. She wore a light-colored royal cape draped over a single shoulder. In the anime, her outfit colors are inverted, with her dark shirt being light pink, her thighs are white and her cape is pink. When chaos broke out, she changed back into her raid suit. As a child, Reiju had shorter hair, but wore a similar dark headband. She has been shown wearing a light pink dress with the letter \"Z\" on the right side, as well as other dresses featuring the number \"0\" in various forms, white boots, and a dark ascot around her neck. As the oldest child of her family, she was formerly taller than her brothers before being outgrown by all of them by the time they reached adulthood.", "personality": "Unlike her cruel and abusive brothers, Reiju can be kind and empathetic, but this is frequently masked by a cool, callous demeanor due to the militarism of her family and her father's stern disdain for compassion. As a result, Reiju prefers to show kindness only when it will not endanger her own comfort or safety. During her childhood, Reiju would openly laugh at Sanji's misery as he was enduring his brothers' vicious acts of cruelty; however, she confided to Sanji that she only laughed with their brothers to avoid being subjected to similar cruel bullying herself, as she would treat him with care and sympathy when they were not around. Reiju also expressed concern for Sanji when it was said that he had died (but, as usual, she hid her concern behind a smile). She even cried in secret as she listened to their father cast Sanji out of the family, before helping him escape onto the Orbit and encouraging him to find friends on the sea. Her instinct for self-preservation resurfaced when she could not understand why Sanji would return to a home that abuses him, just for the sake of protecting his mentor. However, to this day, Sanji remembers Reiju and their mother as the only members of his family to treat him with any degree of compassion. Reiju's general manner is mild and reserved, and she very rarely reveals her true thoughts and feelings to others. Throughout her life, she has disguised her shame and disdain for her Vinsmoke heritage behind an apparent enjoyment of their luxurious royal lifestyle, and a false respect for their family's historical strength, achievements, and privileges. In truth, however, Reiju's innate sense of morality leads her to believe that her kingdom is nothing but a war machine that the world would be better off without. This view applies especially to her father and brothers (excluding Sanji), but also to herself and her own actions as a mercenary. Like her brother Ichiji, Reiju also prefers to think or muse silently to herself as she watches certain developments unfold, hiding her true thoughts and feelings behind an enigmatic smile. Indeed, the only person to whom she has ever openly expressed her true thoughts and feelings, whether as a child or an adult, is Sanji. Reiju has been shown to possess great intelligence and intuition, as she was the only person (among both her family and the Straw Hats) to suspect that Pudding may not be what she seemed. She has also exhibited a calculating side; for example, she appears to be aware of Sanji's weakness for attractive women, showing him ten beautiful chambermaids that would be at his beck and call in order to convince him to accept his arranged marriage. She also easily charmed the Sanji retrieval team in their first meeting, humiliating Yonji and apologizing for his behavior in order to prevent a confrontation with the Straw Hats. Reiju's occasional actions and manner of speech can be slightly flirtatious. Even before she was properly introduced to Luffy, she unabashedly placed her mouth over his in order to suck out the poison which was festering throughout his body.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to being a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Reiju possesses political power over the Germa Kingdom, and over the World Government. Unlike the members of most royal families, she (as well as her father and siblings) is also a commander of their kingdom's military, directly leading their forces in combat and other activities. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Reiju also has access to the advanced technology developed by her family as well as their extravagant wealth. Reiju has sharp intuition, as she had some suspicion that Pudding was not the kind person she appeared to be, a feat that Pudding herself complimented. She also has an excellent memory, as she is able to perfectly recall an intense argument between her parents when she was only three years old. She is shown to have a strong will, as she was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Yonji", "episode": "Episode 825", "chapter": "Chapter 783", "year": 2016, "note": "", "appearance": "As noted by the Straw Hats, Yonji heavily resembles his brother Sanji. He has almost identical facial features, including the distinctive curly eyebrows that resemble the numeral 6 common to the Vinsmoke siblings. However, his hair is green and slicked back into a cowlick, his eyebrows curl in the inverse direction (both face the left side of his face), and he lacks facial hair. He is also more muscular than his brothers, who all have comparatively slim builds, and notably taller than them despite being the youngest child. When commanding the forces of Germa 66, Yonji wears a green raid suit, comprising a shirt bearing the number \"66\" in gold, and a black hooded cloak bearing a green \"4\" on the left. He wears a striped belt with the Germa 66 symbol as a belt buckle, metal gloves, an orange ascot, sunglasses, and black earphones on the top of his head. When outside of his combat attire, Yonji wears a light-colored short sleeved shirt with a frilled collar, along with a striped belt and plain black pants. For formal functions, he also wears a dark floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp. During the Tea Party, Yonji changed into a green suit, comprised of a double-breasted jacket over a white collared shirt, green pants, and brown gloves. He also wore a white royal cape similar to the one he was wearing previously, but shorter, light-colored, and clasped together with two chains. Once chaos broke out, Yonji changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Yonji's hair was styled with a small cowlick on top of his head. He also wore a light green shirt with the number \"4\" on it, an orange bandana around his neck, white pants, and brown boots.", "personality": "Yonji has been described as callous and stingy, refusing to help a dying Luffy and challenging the Straw Hats to plunder the Germa 66 ship for the cure for Luffy's condition. His elder sister, Reiju, claimed that he was rotten to the core. Yonji seems to take amusement in instigating or observing conflict, as he offered to lead Sanji to Niji for a fight with a smile and acted similarly when he tried to goad the Straw Hats into attacking him. He is also proud, getting angry at Reiju when she humiliated him in front of the Straw Hats. This proud nature was in evidence again when, upon suffering defeat at Sanji's hands, Yonji was infuriated and swore to make the latter pay for his actions. Since birth, Yonji is incapable of sympathy and empathy due to the genetic modifications done by his father. As a child, Yonji took part in bullying Sanji, joining his two eldest brothers in mercilessly beating and mocking Sanji's compassion in preparing food for others. This shows that he neither tolerates nor values any such trait, which he believed was worthless to royals. In the present day, Sanji claims that, despite his hopes to the contrary, all of the members of his family have only gotten worse with time. Like several other members of his family, Yonji appears to be arrogant (to the point of being delusional), believing he could defeat Luffy even though he was defeated by Sanji. Furthermore, after Big Mom revealed her treachery, Yonji was unmoved even by the prospect of his own death, laughing at the desperation of their situation. Despite his arrogance and cruel nature, Yonji has a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude, as after Sanji saved his life, Yonji repaid the favor by helping to protect his allies, namely Carrot from Daifuku and saved Sanji and Luffy from an ambush by the Big Mom Pirate's allowing them both to escape from Cacao Island. Yonji is also very mindful of his family's affairs, deciding to not get involved with the Straw Hats in order to ensure that Sanji's wedding would not be jeopardized. He also tried to reprimand Sanji after hearing that Sanji was refusing to cooperate with their family's plans for an alliance with Big Mom. As Nami observed, Yonji, like his older brother Sanji, exhibits lecherous qualities. He is immediately struck by Nami's beauty, and is seen ogling Nami's bounty poster when Germa 66 depart from their brief meeting with the Straw Hats. After witnessing Nami slapping Sanji, he exclaims that he is into her fiery personality. Furthermore, like Sanji, he has also been shown to allow his lust to cloud his better judgement; he absentmindedly expresses his desire to marry Charlotte Pudding himself due to her beauty, prompting Ichiji and Niji to remind him that marrying into her family would not bode well for them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being part of the Vinsmoke Family, Yonji possesses political power over the Germa Kingdom, as well the World Government. Unlike the members of most royal families, he (as well as his father and siblings) is also a commander of his kingdom's military, directly leading their forces in combat and other activities. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Yonji also has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. Yonji's father, Vinsmoke Judge, who has a extremely strict standard for strength, claimed that he was a formidable fighter. However, after a hostile encounter with Sanji, it is noted that his strength is inferior to his older brother's. While Sanji was visibly unharmed after their fight, Yonji's face was severely deformed and required treatment. Yonji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki and remained conscious from her loud scream."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Niji", "episode": "Episode 828", "chapter": "Chapter 787", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 838. He first appeared as a fictional character in the Sora, Warrior of the Sea comic strip in Episode 783.", "appearance": "Niji has blue-colored hair and curly eyebrows. Like all the Vinsmoke siblings, his distinctive curly eyebrows form a spiral that resemble the numeral 6. He has a similar build to his brother Ichiji, being slim with long legs and standing close to him in height. His hair is groomed into a very large, curved partition across the right side of his face, ending in three prominent spikes. While commanding the forces of Germa 66, he wears a dark blue raid suit, including a black cape bearing a blue \"2\", dark goggles over his eyes, gold-colored gauntlets, and an aqua ascot around his neck. A set of horns extend upwards from his pair of orange and red earphones, and his belt bears a buckle with a prominent lightning bolt design. Outside of his raid suit, Niji wears a light-colored buttoned shirt with a tie, as well as dark pants belted with a slimmer version of the belt he wears with his Germa gear. For formal functions, he also wears a dark floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp. During the Tea Party, Niji changed into a blue suit, comprised of a double-breasted jacket and pants, a baby blue cravat, and brown gloves. He also wore a white royal cape similar to the one he was wearing previously, but shorter, light-colored, and clasped together with two chains. When chaos broke out, he changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Niji wore a light blue shirt with the number \"2\" on it, white pants, brown boots, a light blue bandana around his neck, and a pair of smaller goggles. His hair was styled in the same manner as it is in the present, although it was much shorter. In the anime, the bottom of his head was also shaved short as a child, creating an undercut style.", "personality": "Like most members of his family, Niji is proud of his royal status, looking down upon and even abusing commoners and servants. He also expresses disgust at his brother Sanji's displays of kindness towards such individuals. Accustomed to wealth and luxury, he does not see the importance of food as Sanji does, refusing to eat a plate of aligot for what he believes to be its unappetizing appearance, and planning to discard the food into the trash. Since birth, Niji has lacked the ability to feel empathy and sympathy due to the genetic modifications done by his father. He had no qualms about inflicting pain on servants, as shown when he attacked the head chef and even sarcastically stated that he would have avoided her face if he had known that Sanji cared for her. He is outspoken and quick to anger, as he was easily provoked by Sanji's insults, and voiced his irritation at seeing that Sanji had failed to greet him and Ichiji upon their return to the Germa Kingdom. He has also exhibited petty and vindictive behaviors, as he was willing to throw a plate at an innocent chef's face simply because Sanji defended her. Furthermore, Niji's emotional detachment is so strong that he was unmoved by even the prospect of his own death, as well as that of his family. After realizing they had been tricked, Niji remained calm, saying simply that they set their sights too high before laughing at their quandary. While on missions, Niji is serious and business-minded, making sure to collect Germa 66's commissions after performing their mercenary services. Unlike his sister Reiju, who displayed an interest in the philosophical issue of whether war or fractured peace was preferable, Niji dismissed her musings by stating that the Germa is only ever concerned with who was willing and able to pay them the most money. Despite his own cruelty, Niji did express slight disdain for Big Mom's habits of keeping humans trapped in books, showing that he does have some small degree of moral understanding. Like his brothers, Niji shares a lecherous streak, as he became lovestruck and drooled when he first saw Nami. Later, he expressed disappointment at the barmaids Big Mom had sent to them, and expressed a desire to negotiate for Nami's release into their custody. Despite his lecherous tendencies, however, he does have a certain degree of self-control. Unlike Yonji, he is able to overlook Charlotte Pudding's beauty and point out that marrying into the Charlotte Family would not bode well for them. Despite his arrogance and cruel nature, Niji does have a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude, as after Sanji saved his life, Niji wasted no time in repaying Sanji by saving some of his crewmates from being killed by the Big Mom Pirates, an act that strongly contradicts his engineered apathy. This is shown again when he showed concern for his sister when Big Mom targeted her and attempted to kill her. Niji even tried going back to save her before Ichiji told him to leave her behind. Niji also did not hesitate to rush to his father's aid after he was struck down by Big Mom. Later on, at Cacao Island, he personally escorted Sanji and Luffy to safety, narrowly saving his brother from being bombarded by a missile. While he saved his brother, he still called him a \"good-for nothing\" but in a joking manner. Niji has proven himself to be extremely cunning when the situation calls for it. He imitated Nusstorte's voice after he and his siblings defeated the army of Big Mom Pirates sent after them, and completely convinced Mont-d'Or that the Germa Kingdom had been crushed.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Germa Kingdom, Niji has political authority over its subjects, and great influence over the World Government. He also holds a high rank within Germa 66, possessing authority over common soldiers who will die for him on command. A portion of Germa 66, under Niji and Ichiji's command, was able to end a two-year war in four hours, thoroughly annihilating the side they were hired to fight. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Niji also has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. He seems to be proficient at impersonation, as he tricked Charlotte Mont-d'Or into thinking he was Charlotte Nusstorte when calling him from Nusstorte's Den Den Mushi. In the anime, the hand that was holding Nusstorte appears to be glowing. Niji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Judge", "episode": "Episode 832", "chapter": "Chapter 793", "year": 2016, "note": "He first appeared as a fictional character in the Sora, Warrior of the Sea comic strip in Episode 783.", "appearance": "Judge is a large man with long golden hair which reaches his waist. He has a long and thin black mustache which spikes upwards, a thin and small beard, and a prominent cleft chin. He always wears a golden helmet, which was later destroyed during his clash with Big Mom. Much like his children, Judge has curved eyebrows, although they are relatively thicker. He usually wears his Raid Suit, which is composed of a gray robe with the number \"66\" on the bottom front, a large orange cape, a belt with the number \"66\" on the buckle, dark gloves, and boots with jet propellers that allow him to levitate in the air once activated. At the Tea Party, Judge changed into a dark grey suit, comprised of a grey shirt, white tie, trousers, and a double-breasted jacket. On top of the suit, he wore an orange, single-shoulder royal cloak clasped in front of his neck. Thirteen years ago, Judge wore an outfit similar to the one he wears in the present, but with different coloring. Judge did not wear a helmet during his time with MADS (thus exposing his eyebrows) and wore a simple suit instead of his Raid one. He was also far leaner and with shorter hair. His mustache would start growing around this time.", "personality": "Judge exhibits a typical royal hauteur, holding the firm belief that royalty is meant to be served, not to serve others. He disowns his third son, Sanji, after learning about Sanji's \"disgusting\" habit of cooking for others (which he equates with serving others). It has been shown that he passed these attitudes down to his children, as his other sons use the same rationale to justify bullying Sanji during their childhood, and his daughter is seemingly proud of the status and privileges of being born into royalty, but in truth actually despises her father and his beliefs. As part of this pride, Judge is preoccupied with recapturing the past glories of the Vinsmoke Family; for this reason, his lifelong ambition is to retake the entire North Blue, as his ancestors once did. Ironically, it was his desire for power and tremendous arrogance that nearly led to the deaths of himself and his family when Big Mom deceived him in forming an alliance only to betray him and nearly kill him. He has proven that he will not hesitate to use any means to accomplish his goals, including genetically modifying his children into superhumans, and going as far as to tell his wife that he was content with turning their sons into monsters, as long as they win wars. When his wife maintained her opposition, he forced her to undergo the surgery which would instill the modifications, and he was furious at his third son when he failed to exhibit any enhancements from the surgery. As Sanji prepared to leave the family, Judge gave him only one condition: that Sanji never associate himself with Judge or the Vinsmoke name again, since he considered Sanji his greatest failure and shame. Judge also loathes compassion and kindness, as he believes it makes people weak and useless; presumably for similar reasons, Judge does not seem too fond of chivalry (as seen when he called Sanji's chivalry a \"bad influence\" from Zeff). As such, he modified his sons to remove their emotions and ensure they would become strong while believing they were perfect. He expressed rage and despised Sanji heavily for showing such emotions, believing that Sora's kindness in helping the weak is worthless and greatly scorned Sanji due to his kindness. Ironically, Judge was in disbelief when he saw Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji expressing a lack of care at their imminent demise after they fell into the Big Mom Pirates' trap. Even after witnessing the flaw in their design and seeing that the very emotions that Sanji possesses had saved him and his family, Judge still considers such emotions useless and cruelly mocked Sanji in front of the Sanji Retrieval Team. When he aided the Straw Hats against Smoothie's fleet, he angrily yelled at Luffy, demanding to know why he had traveled to Totto Land to save Sanji while listing off all the things he despises about Sanji (e.g compassion and having emotions). When Luffy simply thanked Judge for aiding them, Judge was furious and continuously questioned the Straw Hat captain as the Straw Hats sailed away. As a king, Judge has exhibited significant political astuteness. He understood the full implications of Doflamingo's fall from power, including its impact on the war on Broc Coli Island. He also weighed up Germa's current privileges within the World Government against the benefits of an alliance with Big Mom, before deciding that losing the right to attend Levely was far exceeded by gaining the manpower to retake North Blue. He is naturally cautious when making major political moves, and is conscious not to make commitments without taking measures to avert potential difficulties; when dealing with Big Mom, he sought out his estranged third son specifically because any threat or danger to Sanji would not affect him, and he planned to hold Pudding hostage in the Germa Kingdom to prevent Big Mom from backstabbing him after the wedding. However, Judge still underestimated Big Mom's capacity for betrayal, as he was unaware of her plans to double-cross him before the wedding is even concluded. Even though he put up a cautious defense when dealing with pirates, he nevertheless believed that even criminals such as them would have some honor in keeping with their deals, and became horrified when this view was betrayed. Judge has also exhibited great respect for strength, and the privileges that come with its exercise. He believes that men should speak with physical force alone, and flaunts his own power and accomplishments by hanging an image of himself victorious in the Conquest of Four Nations as interior decoration inside his castle. This view also colors his attitude towards his children, as he only values them when they prove such strength; for this reason, he refused to intervene as his other sons constantly and viciously bullied Sanji when they were all children. By contrast, he doted on all his other children, whose superhuman physical strength became obvious even as children. Even after 13 years of estrangement, after which Sanji returned to the Germa Kingdom with significantly improved physical strength that surprised even him, Judge still refused to acknowledge Sanji as his son. Judge is also extremely hypocritical. While he has emotions himself, he despises Sanji for his kindness and because he did not receive the same modifications as his brothers. While he refuses to privately acknowledge Sanji as a son, he openly acknowledges him in front of guests and allies in order to make himself look like a benevolent father and expresses rage that Sanji would dare to attack his father or sacrifice his family for his crew. When he was in a situation where his life was at stake, he was quick to act extremely cowardly, begging someone to save him while crying. Judge also believes that everyone should have some form of honor, but he has no qualms in using underhanded tactics such as blackmailing Sanji into an arranged marriage or lying to others to satisfy his own selfish agenda. While he claims he isn't inhuman enough to kill his own son, he has no problem in allowing others or Sanji himself to do it for him. In addition, Judge has proven that he is capable of immense cruelty. He was not simply content with demoralizing Sanji in front of his siblings, but further punished him by putting a metal mask over his face and locking him up in a dark cell within the family's castle. He also did nothing when his brothers were brutally bullying him and coldly told the latter he was not a son worth helping. After 13 years apart, his only reason for seeking Sanji out was to use him as a political pawn to further his goals and outright stated he views him as a means to an end. He even threatened the life of Zeff (the man who took Sanji in after Sanji left the family) and placed exploding wrist-cuffs on Sanji's hands (the things Sanji values the most), to ensure Sanji cooperated with the wedding. The only time he has shown an interest in Sanji's safety was in preventing Niji from attacking him, because he still needed Sanji to seal the political alliance. His cruelty is further shown in the anime. During the Conquest of the Four Nation, Judge completely disregarded the four defeated kings' pleas for mercy by kicking them before executing them ruthlessly. Despite his cruelty, however, Judge claims that he is not inhumane enough to kill his children, regardless of his feelings toward them. Despite considering Sanji as an utterly worthless son and a disgrace to the Vinsmoke Family, Judge chose to condemn his third son to life imprisonment instead of putting him to death. When Sanji decided to leave, Judge allowed Sanji to flee the Germa Kingdom, believing that Sanji would never survive on his own on the high seas. While Judge believes that the strong has the right to oppress the weak, he hypocritically shows great fear and despair when he is subjected to the short end of such treatment. When the Charlotte Family revealed Big Mom's plan to massacre his entire family and rendered them powerless with Charlotte Perospero's binding candy, Judge became horrified and sank into despair, weeping in the face of imminent doom and lamenting that his lifelong ambition of taking back North Blue would be beyond his reach. While crying, Judge was mocked by Ichiji, a child that he ensured would be strong and have no emotion, while also seeing Niji and Yonji simply accepting death without any resistance and even laughing about it. Seeing this flaw in their engineered apathy, Judge accusingly stated something is wrong with them, being unable to see that it was his own selfish actions that removed their capacity to feel emotions. Afterwards, he would be surprised when Sanji (the son he scorned for years) goes out of his way to save him from death, despite all the pain Judge put him through. When freed by Sanji, Judge was forced to comply with his third son's order to retreat, though he expressed annoyance at having to follow the latter's commands. Judge later questioned Sanji over his rescue of them despite his hatred for them. After explaining that he did not want to disappoint his father figure, Sanji then angrily disowned Judge as the latter looked at him in silence and finally recognized the depths of the pain that he put Sanji through. Somewhat humbled by Big Mom's betrayal and acknowledging the debt he owed Sanji, Judge solemnly promised to never interfere with Sanji's life nor threaten his mentor as he offered to fight off the Big Mom Pirates to give Sanji and his friends an opening to escape. When Judge confronted Big Mom, he showed some honor as he acknowledged his dream of retaking the North Blue was overreaching as he cursed Big Mom for deceiving him. To repay his debt with Sanji, Judge chose to aid the Straw Hat Pirates at Cacao Island rather than fleeing Totto Land. In the anime, Judge appears to be somewhat arrogant, believing he would be able to defeat Luffy and his crewmates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Judge has knowledge of Haki, as he recognized it when his son used it against him. In spite of his cowardly behavior at the thought of death, he seems to possess a strong enough will as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her screams."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Ichiji", "episode": "Episode 828", "chapter": "Chapter 787", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 838. He first appeared as a fictional character in the Sora, Warrior of the Sea comic strip in Episode 783.", "appearance": "Ichiji has red-colored hair and curly eyebrows. Like all the Vinsmoke siblings, his distinctive curly eyebrows form a spiral that resemble the numeral 6. He is slim with long legs and stands at a comparable height to his brother Niji, being slightly taller. His hair is fashioned into three prominent cowlicks on the right side, and also curls upwards slightly at the roots, like his sister's. His right arm bears a prominent tattoo: the number \"1\" in the center of a stylized circle, surrounded by flames. When commanding the forces of Germa 66, he wears a dark red raid suit, including white gauntlets, a red ascot, a white cape (bearing a red \"1\" on its left), as well as a pair of sunglasses.Outside of his raid suit, Ichiji wears a dark shirt with an upturned collar and a light cravat, as well as a pair of light-colored pants.For formal functions, he also wears a floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp. However, unlike his siblings, his cape is light-colored. During the Tea Party, Ichiji changed into a white frilled dress shirt, as well as dark pants and gloves. He also wore a light-colored royal cape similar to the one he was wearing previously, but shorter and clasped together with two chains. In the anime his cape is dark red. After chaos broke out, he changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Ichiji did not wear glasses and he wore a red shirt with the number \"1\" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a dark magenta-reddish bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the same manner as it is in the present.", "personality": "Like most members of his family, Ichiji is proud of his royal status, looking down upon commoners and servants. Like his father, Niji, and Yonji, he expresses disgust at Sanji's displays of kindness towards such individuals, and labels him a \"disgrace\" to the family name. Despite being a prince of a highly imperialistic kingdom, however, Ichiji demonstrates little care for political affairs, and said so when his family discussed the mission on Broc Coli Island. Since birth, Ichiji has lacked the ability to feel empathy and sympathy, due to the genetic modifications performed on him by his father.He is cold and brutal to the people he fights, caring only about his task and not their lives. He expresses disdain for the people who oppose him, commenting that the four hours he spent fighting on Broc Coli Island had been a waste of effort. He also expects his subordinates in Germa 66 to lay down their lives for him at any point, showing no emotion at their deaths. Ichiji has also demonstrated that even the prospect of his own death is not enough to move him. After Big Mom revealed her treachery, Ichiji reacted with nonchalance, speaking only to reprimand his father's tears as pathetic. Ichiji is notably more hardened than Niji and Yonji as he was more focused on the mission. When Reiju was attacked by Big Mom, Ichiji simply dismissed Reiju as weak and told Niji to focus on their task to hold back the Big Mom Pirates. When his father was struck down by Big Mom, Ichiji did not bother to rush to Judge's aid, single-mindedly focused on escorting Bege and Caesar to safety as he attacked Katakuri. Unlike his more hot-headed younger brothers, Ichiji's usual manner is very calm and measured. However, when he is provoked, he reveals his capacity for extreme violence and brutality. During their childhood, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji all enjoyed tormenting Sanji because of his relative physical weakness and his interest in cooking, but Ichiji appeared to enjoy it the most. His behavior during these encounters also demonstrates his aloofness, as he preferred to let Niji and Yonji do most of the attacking while he watched. However, when Sanji tried to retaliate against Ichiji during an episode of bullying, Ichiji proved to be the most vicious of the brothers, beating Sanji almost senseless and warning his younger brother to never touch him again. When a despairing enemy soldier tried to shoot him during the war on Broc Coli Island, Ichiji told the man that he did not care about his dead family or his country before killing the soldier with his own gun. Additionally, like his sister Reiju, Ichiji prefers to watch events unfold without interfering, forming his own opinions and speaking up primarily to have the last word in a conversation. Despite his ruthlessness and engineered apathy, Ichiji has a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude. When Oven attempted to kill both Sanji and his captain, Ichiji wasted no time in saving his brother byassaulting Oven as repayment for saving his life during Big Mom's Tea Party. Like his younger brothers, Ichiji possesses a lecherous streak, as he became lovestruck when he first saw Nami. However, he is able to put his amorous tendencies aside and think rationally, as he reminds his brother Yonji that marrying into the Charlotte Family would require forfeiting their freedom after Yonji stated a desire to marry Charlotte Pudding himself.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Germa Kingdom, Ichiji has political authority over its subjects. He also holds a high ranking within Germa 66, giving him authority over common soldiers as well as the ability to order them to sacrifice themselves in his defense. A portion of Germa 66, under Ichiji and Niji's command, was able to end a two-year war in four hours, thoroughly annihilating the side they were hired to fight.After Judge was seriously wounded by Big Mom, Ichiji appeared to take command of the kingdom in his stead, ordering his siblings to move the ships out of Lake Aprico. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Ichiji has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. Ichiji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream."},

Her eyes appear flat and dull, and she no longer smiles, save for when she successfully resisted Hogback's orders for the first time.

She wears a short black evening gown and black high-heeled boots, with a red-orange fur boa wrapped around her neck.", "personality": "In life, despite her fame and popularity, Cindry was a compassionate woman who was kind to everyone. After she died, Cindry's corpse was implanted with a shadow, causing it to gain a different personality. As a zombie, Cindry despises plates and wishes all those existing in the world would vanish; her sheer hatred of plates will occasionally cause her to outright disobey Hogback's commands in order to destroy more of them. Her hatred for plates causes her to serve food without them, forcing Hogback and others to eat their food off of the table. On at least one occasion, she has even threatened to physically injure Hogback for saying Moria should have made her shadow forfeit its past memories so they would be able to eat on plates. She is described by Hogback as a depressing person whose violent words manage to horrify him every time. However, despite her rebellious nature, Cindry retains a zombie's obedience and will do whatever Hogback pleases as long as Gecko Moria orders her to, going as far as to accept his physical abuse and orders to lick the floor in a degrading manner.

{"name": "Vasco Shot", "episode": "Episode 575", "chapter": "Chapter 484", "year": 2010, "note": "He was first mentioned by Emporio Ivankov in Chapter 538.", "appearance": "Vasco Shot is a huge man, three times a normal man's height; of the Blackbeard Pirates' core members, his size is second only to Sanjuan Wolf's. He is stocky, overly top-heavy in build with thick arms, proportionate to his torso, that reach knee level, looking massive compared to his disproportionally shorter, thinner legs. Shot has light skin with a red undertone, an extremely wide neck, and on top an unattractive face that is set most apart by his big, bulbous nose: uniform in its thickness, protruding down over his mouth and slightly frontward, with small, nearly unseen nose wings and a strange placement: its bridge starting higher than Shot's eyes are set. The latter are widely spaced beside his nose, drooping, with purplish-gray irises underlined by black lines (more prominent in the manga) that jut upward from the outer eye corners like lashes, and being topped by what seem to be thin, short brows always drawn downward, touching the nose's upper edge. Otherwise, Shot is seen with a perpetual, drunken smile, his mouth gaping wide, exposing his big, rounded teeth, with his tongue sticking out, salivating, thickening the apples of his cheeks (marked by blush marks), and forming prominent chin folds. His tall, rounded forehead is furrowed, with a black jester's hat above whose two cones bend over, and are tipped by white pompoms. Behind, his black, waved hair comes out to go down his back, and placed upon the sides of his neck (three on each) are large, golden ring piercings. True to his moniker, Shot is always seen chugging on a large, yellowish gourd of liquor strapped on his back by a rope, which has the kanji \"sake\" (?) on its bottom section. Clothes-wise, beside his hat, he has only been seen donning the basic Impel Down prison uniform, comprising a long-sleeved shirt and shorts striped black-and-white, plus white slip-on shoes. Midway through the Egghead Arc, Shot's design changed from his previous appearance at Amazon Lily. He now wears dark lipstick and has a small star tattoo on the left-side of his forehead, as well as a darkened nose. His outfit now consists of a black feathered coat, worn over diamond-patterned overalls.", "personality": "As his epithet suggests, Shot's general bearing is that of a nonchalant, somewhat dopey drunk; having yet to be seen in a sober state, how strongly inebriation affects his personality is unknown. He does seem to hate the idea of sobering up, as he at one point suggested to his crew that they invade a town somewhere solely because he had run out of booze. However, Shot's apparent goofiness seems to bely his viciousness, which is established by the supposed cruelty of his crimes that led to his bygone imprisonment; said to be of outstanding brutality even by the standards of Impel Down's Level 6 prisoners, and as a result of which his very existence had to be erased from history. Upon his crew's arrival at the Summit War of Marineford, Shot was seen asking for permission to kill everyone present at the scene, suggesting a lust for battle. Vasco Shot has displayed a lecherous nature such as when he tried to dissuade Devon from killing Boa Hancock, suggesting that they could have fun with her if they took her away. He also felt enough lust towards Boa Hancock to be affected by her Devil Fruit ability. Shot, like many characters, has a signature laughter style: \"Toputoputopu\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "Over the two-year timeskip, Shot has become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" who personally guard the Emperor, acquiring great authority in the crew as captain of its eighth ship.

However, he is strong enough to have been contained in Level 6 of Impel Down where only the world's worst, most dangerous criminals are held, where Emporio Ivankov considers him very notorious. This is checked, as when Blackbeard recruited him alongside other prisoners, he chose only those who could survive when pitted against all other Level 6 prisoners in a free-for-all battle royale. "},
{"name": "Vegapunk", "episode": "Episode 684", "chapter": "Chapter 610", "year": 2012, "note": "He was first mentioned by Koby in Chapter 433.", "appearance": "Vegapunk is a relatively tall elderly man, standing just under Jinbe in height (without his brain), with slender limbs and red cheeks. He has a noticeably elongated but neatly sliced head and has a shaft driven in to support a structure resembling the top of an apple-core and its leaf. His forehead is remarkably wide, his tongue is very long, while his eyes are close to his potato nose. He has a bald head on top, but has spiky white hair on the sides, as well as a thick mustache. He wears a short white coat with SSG on the back, a pink shirt with red polka dots, purple pants, and purple DOM shoes. Before he cut out his brain, the size of his head had supposedly reached the height of Giants. When he was 43 years old, Vegapunk had an enlarged head accounting for much of his height, and his hair was dark and covered most of his head. He wore a leather jacket, a light shirt, a belt, dark pants, and dress shoes. When he was part of MADS, his head was much smaller with a bandage on the left side, his tongue was not sticking out, and lacked the mustache. He wore a Hawaiian shirt and goggles. During Kuma's explanation on his Pacifista modification, he seems to be wearing yellow gloves and a striped shirt with a white lab coat.", "personality": "In his youth, Vegapunk was a generous person who cared very much for the inhabitants of his island, willing to help them with his inventions. He is considered the island's pride and joy, and the residents are still hoping for his return. Each of Vegapunk's six satellites possesses a dominant personality trait that is presumably present in Vegapunk in general. While he has strong morals and a sense of justice and pride as a scientist (Shaka), he also possesses malevolent traits and an inclination to steal from others in order to fund his research (Lilith) and can be prone to greed (York); there is considerable conflict and reasoning between these two sides. He appears to be quite thoughtful and wise (Edison and Pythagoras) but can be prone to getting angry at other people's inability to properly replicate and utilize his technological developments, to the point of lashing out violently (Atlas). Unlike his former fellow scientist Caesar Clown, Vegapunk was far more moral about what he would do in pursuit of achievements. He refused to involve children in the gigantification process despite repeated failures. He also vetoed the creation or release of the H2S poison gas weapon for fear of it harming innocent people. Vegapunk also has a strongly idealistic and humanitarian side, proudly pronouncing his plans to use his future world-spanning inventions to help humanity and stop ongoing conflicts such as wars, even choosing to work for the World Government out of belief he could do more good for people by doing so. Unfortunately, certain people, like Jewelry Bonney, fail to see that side of Vegapunk as she was under the belief that he has no qualms with committing sacrifices and atrocities, personal or otherwise, in his air for greater knowledge and progress. He seems to have an interest for dragons, as he created two of them on Punk Hazard, and an artificial Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into one. However, he deemed the fruit a failure, but that was only due to the user's dragon form not being the same color as the dragon form bestowed by the real Devil Fruit it was based on. On that note, Vegapunk is a serious perfectionist; he was seen bawling on the ground after Luffy had informed him of how an artificial Devil Fruit, which he had made from Kaidou's lineage factor, had led its consumer to gaining the same Mythical Zoan abilities, albeit with a different color scheme. Given his nature as a scientist, Vegapunk has a natural interest in theories and the nature of science itself. He would elaborate on theories and concepts of science, even some others had brought up. When he heard that a certain scholar in the West Blue theorized that the human body loses 21 grams if they die, which was the weight of the soul, Vegapunk got so intrigued that he wanted to see it for himself, doing experiments on his thoughts and observing. His scientific interest would even go as far as that he would reach out to his close confidents, namely Bartholomew Kuma, to aid him in the experiments, knowing fully the full scope of the abilities he had but still wanted to find out if the theory could be proven and if similar things to the soul could be weighted as well, not letting go of his desire until he could run the experiments, not even refraining from begging until he could prove the theory and satisfy his scientific interest. In addition to his nature as a scientist and the benefits it brings, he also seems to be aware of the dangers and said nature a scientist has to bear as he was fully aware that his research, especially regarding the Ohara Incident and the Void Century, would make him a threat to the Government, calling it a scientist's nature to want to peek at answers knowing he had uncovered too much of the past to be kept alive. He even knew that CP0 was sent to assassinate him and prevent him from continuing his research. He also seems to be insistent on the importance of his words and science, as he was annoyed by Luffy's ignorance and disinterest in his work calling him out for his repeated disinterest. He appears to be honorable, as he granted Kuma his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Thousand Sunny until the Straw Hat Pirates return. Vegapunk takes his survival seriously and will not hesitate to ask for help when necessary. He requested Luffy to get him off Egghead and away from the World Government when they moved to assassinate him, despite just meeting the young Emperor. He does not mind dragging others allies into helping him without considering their circumstances first. He has a verbal tic in which he adds \"Quasar\" (, Kus?) to his requests for help.", "abilities_and_powers": "While it is unclear when Vegapunk started using his satellites to split his workload, he himself is famed as the greatest scientific genius the world has ever known, having tremendous knowledge and unmatched understanding in all fields of science, from cell biology to military technology, at the beginning of his work on Karakuri Island as noted by Franky. His scientific expertise is said to be at least 500 years ahead of his contemporaries. It seems that even in his youth, the scientist was a prodigy already considered a genius, but lacked the skills, funds, and materials to develop his inventions, although that did not stop him from theorizing the creation of Pacifista cyborgs, including their laser weapons back then. This is proven by the fact that Franky was able to recreate the technologies by self-studying the blueprints Vegapunk left behind on his home island. Regardless, the creations and blueprints that he has left behind are considered invaluable, and any damage inflicted to them is considered a crime. He has read and fully memorized every single book that had been rescued from Ohara. Vegapunk has a deep knowledge and understand of Devil Fruits, having studied many old texts about them. He is the only known person beside The Five Elders to realize the true nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit after witnessing his awakened form. He discovered exactly how Devil Fruit powers are transferred over to a user, and he was also the scientist behind the method of adding Devil Fruit powers into inanimate objects, such as swords and guns. By using this method, he was able to create a unique blood for his latest creation, the Seraphim, by extracting the Lineage Factor of a Paramecia User, synthesizing it, creating the so-called \"Green Blood\". He even went as far as having developed a theory about how Devil Fruits came into existence from his knowledge, theorizing that Devil Fruits are the embodiment of what humans desire and could become, which is also the reason why the sea, which he calls \"the mother of nature\" rejects any Devil Fruit user and makes them unable to swim, as such behavior is loathed by the sea and it considers these wishes to transcend the world people wish to live in as \"abnormalities\". Vegapunk is an extraordinary surgeon. He is the one who modified Bartholomew Kuma into a cyborg, and he has produced many Pacifista replicas of him as well, granting them some of the abilities of Kizaru's Devil Fruit in the process. These replicas bleed actual blood, like Kuma himself. However, they lack Kuma's own Devil Fruit abilities. After the two-year timeskip, Sentomaru revealed that the latest Pacifista had been further modified; these were later revealed to be the Seraphim, replicas of the Seven Warlords of the Sea in their youth, albeit with Lunarian traits. Perhaps Vegapunk greatest medical feat is removing his own giant head and part of his brain without killing himself. The lasers that are installed into the Pacifista were apparently supposed to be so advanced, that only Vegapunk knew how to create them. It was also stated that the dragons found on Punk Hazard were Vegapunk's own creations. He was able to survive the explosion of Caesar Clown's mass murder weapon. It is unknown whether his \"Stella\" body was present and was sturdy enough to survive the explosion, or one of his Satellite bodies was present in his stead. Via his research, he discovered ways of allowing Marine ships to pass through the Calm Belts without fear of a Sea King attack, by covering the bottom of the ships with Seastone."},

Under the coat he wore a mauve-colored shirt with a purple-colored ascot embedded with a red jewel, with a golden-yellow outline at the top in the tie. He also wore black-colored gloves. As Vergo was a messy eater, he tended to have pieces of food stuck to his face from time to time, such as French fries when residents of a certain island had a flashback of him, and a partially eaten hamburger patty stuck to his left cheek when he was first introduced. However, once pointed out by Monet, Vergo then proceeded to finish eating the piece of food stuck to his cheek. This also extends to eating utensils- a stirring spoon from a coffee cup got stuck to his face and it stayed on his face for a long time, as it was still stuck when he talked with Caesar following the spread of Shinokuni, and when he proceeded to eliminate G-5. After being interrupted by a kick from Sanji, however, the spoon was knocked loose from his face. When he was younger, his relative features seem to be the same but is seen with a bowl haircut and lacking a full beard. During his time as a vice admiral of G-5, Vergo wore a Marine coat over his current attire.", "personality": "Through his short confrontation with Trafalgar Law, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man. He could also come across as patronizing, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the Warlord. Seeing himself as above the Warlord, Vergo quickly reminded Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He was also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-san. While around citizens, Vergo was cited to be an amiable, personable and approachable person in comparison to the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in accidents at sea. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believed that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marine bureaucracy, Vergo had proven himself to be highly manipulative and insidious. His true identity being a secret to most, he could become very cruel and ruthless once he revealed his true disposition, and would murder his own Marine subordinates without so much as a moment of hesitation or explanation. Being their leader also made him believe that anything he does to them is his right, believing they are nothing but rejects. His cruelty was reflected in his fighting style, as he often brutally beat his victims into submission. He also offered to cut one of Law's ears off and send it to Doflamingoas proof that he killed him. Contrary to his G-5 subordinates, he is very loyal to the Donquixote Family, respecting his comrades as family, though he showed extreme brutality when it comes to dealing with traitors, as he violently beat and scolded Rosinante for his treason; similarly, he does not hesitate in using similar violence against disrespectful juniors. Despite his perceived intelligence, however, Vergo sometimes seemed to lapse into moments of witlessness such as when he claimed to Caesar that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly thereafter that there had never been any cookies to begin with. Another example is when he was about to go after Smoker and Law, he could not remember where he placed his sword, only for Monet to remind him that he is not a swordsman. Even Doflamingo is aware of this, as when Vergo claimed to have purchased a camera only to be reminded that he did not buy one at all. In fact, he did not even notice there was a large piece of patty (or any other food and utensils) on his cheek until he was made to notice it. This habit was even around when he was ten years old, as a large, partly-eaten loaf of french bread was stuck on his cheek.", "abilities_and_powers": "Vergo was a powerful man who was confident in his superiority to an opponent like Trafalgar Law, who was strong enough to become a Warlord. This was proven by Vergo's two easy victories over Law, although the fact that he had Law's heart, which he used to weaken him, should be taken into consideration. Regardless, Doflamingo had enough confidence in Vergo's abilities to assign him to dispose of Law. Vergo's mere presence was enough to scare off one of Punk Hazard's extremely fierce dragons. He completely overwhelmed Unit 01 of G-5, including Tashigi(minus Smoker at the time), despite their superior numbers. Vergo defeated Vice Admiral Smoker with moderate difficulty (while still holding back his full strength). It can be seen that Smoker already knew that he could not defeat Vergo, so he decided to concentrate on retrieving Law's heart.. Even when he was a 10-year-old, Vergo was strong enough to burn down an entire city alongside Trebol, Diamante and Pica, all of whom were children. He also possessed considerable knowledgeable of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki have the qualities of a king. As a former vice admiral and the former head of G-5, he had command over his lower ranking subordinates, as well as control over the entire base. He was also skillful enough to deceive the entirety of the Marines, including the former fleet admiral, Sengoku, and the observant Smoker, in hiding his true affiliations, as well as deceiving citizens with pretexts by falsifying the crimes into \"accidents at sea\". Even after abdicating the position of Corazon, he remained an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates until his death, meaning he had command over the two thousand soldiers and eleven officers of his pirate crew; his command was equal to Trebol, Diamante and Pica, and just underneath Doflamingo himself."},

He is formally introduced in Chapter 613.", "appearance": "Decken is a tall individual with beige-colored skin (mid-dark brown in manga), slim build, and lanky limbs. His most distinguishing feature is his four legs. He has a short, scraggly goatee, a long, wavy mustache with spiky edges, and similarly, long, wavy and spiky black hair. After being rejected by Shirahoshi, he shaves the top of his head in depression. He also has sharp teeth, with bigger webs between his fingers than most fish-men, a very thin, pointy nose and a prominent hunch that puts his head on equal level with his shoulders. He wears three golden bands on each of his ankles, and two pairs of sandals. He sports green overalls reaching just below his knees, with ruffled edges and decorative buttons on both the straps, over a light green-colored (white in the anime) shirt with ruffled edges. He sports a yellow cape, also complete with ruffled edges, draped over his shoulders, and two massive beaded necklaces hanging on his chest. He wears a yellow fedora with a purple band on his head which he seems to have had for at least ten years. In order to maintain his power's lock onto Princess Shirahoshi, he wore a red glove on his right hand at most times. While masquerading as his supposed cursed ancestor during his first appearance, he wore a dark colored cloak that covered up his body. In the past, he wore a broadly horizontal-striped shirt under light overalls with a gun strapped to his hip. He had cat-like whiskers instead of a mustache and did not have a goatee. His hair was shorter and was straight and rounded like dreadlocks.", "personality": "Decken often has his arms crossed over his chest with each of his hands holding two fingers in a 'victory' sign. He is very formal, as shown when he introduced himself to Hody Jones. He often adds \"I think\" (, no hazuda?) to the end of his sentences (the word \"think\" is changed to \"suspect\" in the English Dub). He also does not want to become a subordinate to anyone which is the reason why he did not join the Arlong Pirates, but is willing to get into a partnership with anyone who shares a similar goal with him, as long as he is treated as no less than an equal. He seems to be somewhat of a poet, reciting a haiku after Shirahoshi rejected him. He was also reciting a poem when the Straw Hats first encountered him. Decken is completely obsessed with Princess Shirahoshi, which leads him to act without thinking straight and usually acts one step ahead of the situation, such as writing wedding invitations before even proposing or realizing that he has no friends to invite, or calling Neptune \"father\" before the wedding that Neptune disapproves of anyways. He is also a madman when it comes to Shirahoshi, as he is willing to go to extreme measures such as throwing Noah just to kill one person. However, unlike many fish-men and despite joining forces with the New Fish-Men Pirates, Decken himself never showed interest about any sympathy for or against the centuries of prejudice against humanity and it's just centered to marry the mermaid princess and achieving the purpose of his ancestors. He has been described as a bandit of the sea floor, and the residents of Fish-Man Island feared him for years. Typical of a pirate, he believes violence is the answer for everything, which is most evident by how he displays his affection for Shirahoshi by throwing large weapons at her. He has a desire for treasure as he does not approve of his giant anglerfish, Ankoro, eating ships before he can collect the ships' treasure. In the anime, Decken is quite arrogant, believing Jinbe to be weaker than him despite his Warlord status. He tends to overreact to certain situations that surprise him, such as reacting shocked and depressed when Shirahoshi turned him down for \"not being her type\" and decided to cry endlessly, recite a haiku, and shave the top of his head in depression. This was shown again when she rejected him a second time despite her life being on the line at the time and when her brothers showed up. This makes him one of the more comedic villains shown (like Buggy or Spandam). Like many characters in the series, Decken has a distinct laugh, starting his with \"Ba\" (i.e Bahohohoho!).", "abilities_and_powers": "Vander Decken IX is the eighth descendant of the legendary wicked pirate Vander Decken and the captain of the Flying Pirates: as such, he has authority over his crew and controls the legendary, enormous ship Flying Dutchman. He also has at least two gigantic sea creatures at his command, these being the fish-man Wadatsumi and the giant anglerfish Ankoro. When Decken joined forces with Hody Jones, it was stated that these two pirate captains working together would be unstoppable, although their relationship was fragile, which hampered, and ultimately broke off, their alliance."},

He is extremely tall, standing at around the same height as Blackbeard, who is over 11 feet tall. He appears calm all the time, even in battles, and his typical expression is generally emotionless. His eyebrows are almost always furrowed in what looks like a saddened expression, and he rarely smiles. The left lens of the black glasses he wears is a normal, rectangular eyepiece, but the right side is circular and holds what appears to be a cross hair. He sports a large black hat, protruding out to both sides. Its shape bears an uncanny resemblance to an upturned boat's hull. Augur is constantly wearing a long black cape, under which he wears a button-up, pale lavender shirt with loose sleeves, and simple black pants, with a maroon belt with an aqua outline that goes over a small portion of his shirt. He also wears black shoes. Due to the size of his rifle Senriku, he carries it leaned against his shoulder. After the timeskip, Augur has grown a goatee.", "personality": "Augur is extremely calm and analytical even during battle. He very rarely changes his facial expression. However, in his confrontation with Ace on Banaro Island, he showed a darker side - showing a devilish grin after a failed kill shot. Like his crewmates, Augur is a heavy believer in fate.

{"name": "Uta", "episode": "Episode 1055", "chapter": "Chapter 1029", "year": 2022, "note": "", "appearance": "Uta is a young woman of medium height with long hair that is white on her left side and red on her right; the colors are perfectly separated at the middle of her scalp. Her hair is arranged into two long ponytails with two circular braids at the end; these circular braids are also seen at the top of her head. Her left eye is shrouded by her white hair. Sometimes, she is seen with a pair of feathery wings on her back, the right one pink and the left one white. Her left eye is shown to be bright purple. She wears a short white dress ending at her upper thighs; the dress possesses a frilly neckline and a black bow and buttons down the middle. On her left arm, she wears a light blue sleeve that covers the entire arm with Luffy's childhood drawing of Shanks' \"straw hat\". Additionally, she wears a set of golden cone-shaped headphones with light-blue bands over her ears. She was also shown wearing a multi-colored jacket with numerous designs scattered on it.", "personality": "For the most part, Uta seems to be cheerful and optimistic. She possesses a strong ideal to build a new era of peace and happiness through her voice, even if it means people would be forced to live forever in the Uta World. She is shown to be highly empathetic, as seen feeling righteous anger for a fan that wrote her a letter after losing loved ones. She holds great value to the opinion of her fans, doubting her plans temporarily after some of her fans opposed her actions, though she evidently holds her own ideals above them, as she turns her fans into objects to stop them from speaking their minds. She also hates pirates, due to how much they destroy the lives of her fans and due to her father and his crew abandoning her. However, she is also highly ignorant of pirates in general, as seen in Uta Diary #4, where she discovered posters of Donquixote Doflamingo and Charlotte Linlin, and was completely unaware that they were a part of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Four Emperors respectively, instead commenting on their fashion and the photo itself. After her plans for New Genesis fail, she admits there are pirates who are worthy of respect, as she regains her admiration for her father's crew and confides in Luffy's dream to usher a new world by becoming the Pirate King. Due to her traumatic past, her isolation in Elegia, and the continuous consumption of wake-shrooms, which causes the consumer to slowly lose control of their emotion, Uta became mentally unstable at times when her plans and ideals was met with resistance, causing her to have episodes where she would act erratic, ruthless, and borderline cruel to those around her, regardless whether they were her enemies or fans, as she was quick to abandon and try to kill Luffy when he refused to go along with her plans. This also made her incapable of reason or negotiation by anyone, and she would ignore the pleas and warnings of others as she had planned to use Tot Musica as a last resort despite the warnings of destruction it would cause. Her reunion with Shanks would cause her to descend to complete madness to the point she would perform the ritual. As a child, Uta acted like a stereotypical diva, being infatuated with jewelry and glamour and not liking to get dirty. She could be overbearing and mean, particularly to other children like Luffy, and though she liked to throw out insults she would cry if her victim insulted her back. She looked down on some of the wilder, more boorish behaviors of her father and his crew, but was still proud of being a member of the Red Hair Pirates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Uta's singing voice has been appraised as \"otherwordly\" (, betsu jigen?), enough to grant her the title of the world's greatest diva. Aside from her singing talents, Uta is also great at music theory, showing amazing skill as a lyricist and composer by having written her most famous songs herself. In terms of physical prowess, Uta has not displayed any superior abilities outside of being a talented and dexterous dancer, fully relying on her Devil Fruit ability to compensate. In fact, when Luffy fought her, he never actually directly attacked her body, knowing that he could potentially kill her if he did. She also does not have a lot of stamina, since usually she would fall asleep after only a few songs. In the movie, she counteracted this weakness by continuously consuming Wake-shrooms in order to last for hours."},

In the cold, Usakkov wears a thick, red coat with a fluffy collar.", "personality": "Usakkov is a jovial person who loves to perform in public. He may not be the most confident off stage, as he and the other newkama were nervous and doubtful of Monkey D.

The topknot has been cut off by Kiku during his attempt to capture her. His two forearms are covered with indigo tattoos, and the left tattoo goes down to his hip. When not in a sumo match, Urashima wears a large, light green-colored samurai gi that has a flower emblem on the sleeves and a square pattern on the rest. He also wears geta sandals on his disproportionately small feet, and he has two katanas which he wears on his left hip. During his meeting with Mouseman, he wears a kimono with white and blue squares. He wears a dark purple mawashi when he's sumo wrestling.", "personality": "Urashima is very full of himself due to his high social status, and perceives that he has the authority to do whatever he wants to lower-class people, whom he views with great disdain. Unless he takes an interest in them, such as with Kiku, he will very vocally degrade them should they annoy him. If someone stands up to him and threatens his honor, Urashima has no problem with attacking them brutally to ensure his honor is not tainted, even against a woman. He is easily susceptible to the influence of people who encourage and enable him to use his status for his own benefit, such as Mouseman. Because of his conceit, Urashima often does whatever he wants regardless of how it affects other people. He once ordered some restaurant owners to cook their beloved pet raccoon dog for him to eat simply because he liked its meat. He also dislikes leftovers. While sumo wrestling, he sometimes intentionally uses illegal moves, as seen when he tried to jab at Luffy's eyes in their fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being of samurai class, along with his national athlete status, Urashima is of high social status within Wano, and is wealthy.

Apart from his smile, he also has what appears to be a stitched-up scar vertically descending over, and falling short just above his left eye. On his chin he has a prominent, jet-black, and scruffy beard that extends upwards to the sides of his jaw and then converges with his equally-dark side-burns. He seems to sport the short and clean-cut sort of hairstyle generally sported by monks. He also has black tattoos going down his shoulders that somewhat resemble fire. He dresses in similar robes to Divine Soldiers underneath the khaki robes he wears (which is also worn by the rest of his crew), which includes the white full-bodied garment with severed sleeves, that exposes tattoos patterned like flames on both biceps. He wears a pair of gold earrings, black gloves and a rather large red bead necklace. He also has a pair of large wings growing out from the middle of his back.

The only times he has not been seen smiling are when his crew approached Raijin Island and when he prayed for Kaidou. From what has been shown of Urouge so far he can be considered a brave man, as he was not afraid of fighting people with higher bounties than him, such as Killer. However, it is possible that he did not know his bounty or he knew that Killer had a high bounty because he notoriously attacks civilians. In spite of this though, he quit the battle when X Drake jumped in to halt the fight. Despite being brave he is not blind to danger either, for when he faced a Pacifista (who he believed was the real Kuma) and Kizaru at the same time, he wondered if that was his end. However, even when facing death, he could still laugh at what he believed was a joke, made by Basil Hawkins, about his fate.

Her attire appears to be less formal than the other high-ranking officers', consisting of an untucked shirt, with the sleeves rolled up and a tie around her neck, and calves-long pants, which makes her somewhat resemble the animal of her name, the crane. She sports earrings made of beads, and wears two bracelets on her right wrist. The epaulets on her Marine coat are golden for the outer epaulets and purple with two white dots for the inner epaulets. During the time of the Battle of Edd War, they were the standard blue. Twenty-seven years ago, at age 49, her skin was already wrinkled despite only being middle-aged. In her youth, she was quite beautiful and had dark blue hair tied up in a loose ponytail, with side bangs that framed both sides of her face. She wore a standard Marine uniform with a rifle strapped to her back.", "personality": "She is a veteran Marine who is not without wisdom for her age. She seems extremely knowledgeable; she knew Donquixote Doflamingo set the Marines to fight each other in the Marine and Warlord meeting when all others thought the two were simply messing around, and knew who Laffitte was on sight. She is not above telling off the younger marines that show concern for her well-being when she steps up to fight the incoming pirates at Marine HQ. She then justifies herself being on the front line with the other vice admirals by stating there is no longer a safe place left in the world for her to run to anyway. According to Garp, she is an empathetic woman although she does not show thisdisposition very often. Tsuru follows \"Clean Justice\" or \"Cleansing Justice\".

She is well-renowned and recognized as a legendary figure by the likes of Franky and Usopp. Even in her elderly age of 63, Tsuru was strong enough to strike intense fear into Doflamingo, who even becoming a Warlord of the Sea was an extremely powerful pirate, as he was quick to flee during her many pursuits of the Donquixote Pirates throughout the North Blue, and despite his initial plans to reclaim Law from the Marines's custody to use his powers to immortalized himself, Doflamingo quickly changed this plan upon seeing her battleship off the coast of Minion Island. Several years later, when Doflamingo lost his title as a Warlord, he still showed respect for her, a stark contrast to his usual disrespect to other high-ranking Marines. Alongside Sengoku and Issho, she was part of Doflamingo's Marine escort who fought against Jack, a right-hand man of Emperor Kaidou."},

{"name": "Trebol", "episode": "Episode 700", "chapter": "Chapter 629", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Trebol is a toweringly tall hunchback who, despite his impairment, looms over his captain Doflamingo at a similar height to Diamante and Pica. His appearance is dishevelled and unkempt. His attire consists of a long, ragged blue coat (initially dark grey, then cyan in the anime) made of his Devil Fruit mucus with a navy (dark in the anime) blue ring pattern. Mucus and sticky slime constantly trail from the coat's hem. The front of the coat is cleverly designed to resemble the front of a barrel chest, making Trebol appear to be a thickset man wearing a loose cloak over his shoulders. In truth, he is extremely skinny to the point of being emaciated, and everything under the hollow of his stooped chest is a decoy made of mucus. His posture and attire make him look like a giant snail. Trebol is barefoot but wears a mid-length chained-shackle on each of his ankles, which are not linked together. He usually wears a pair of sunglasses covering his small slanted eyes and has a broad flat nose, commonly seen with snot hanging out of it. He wears his dark hair in a bowl-cut, complete with a long, thick beard and stubble on his upper lip. His lips are a bit thicker than normal, and his teeth are round and have some space between them. He also has a small scar just above his right eyebrow. He holds a scepter with a club suit design on the top. This scepter also has a lighter built into it, which he can use to ignite his mucus. As a child, Trebol lacked his mucus coat, but his nose was still constantly running. He wore a bowler hat, his signature sunglasses, and a tattered shirt and pants. He used sandals before, at some point ending up with shackles in place of actual shoes. He appeared to have grown up on the streets, judging by his dirty, tattered appearance and having scrounged for food. At 18 and 33 years old, he lacked a beard. He continued wearing his bowler hat and also used a cane, which he may have replaced with the scepter he holds currently. At age 39, he was no longer using his bowler hat, taking on an appearance similar to his current one. He also changed the design of his mucus coat to represent his position as the Club seat of the Donquixote Family. When he was 47, Trebol had started using his gold scepter and changed his coat to a striped version with colors slightly paler than the scheme of his most recent coat. His hair and even part of his lip took on a sloppy, dribbling appearance, oozing downwards from the effects of his Devil Fruit, but Trebol later reverted to the facial appearance he had during Doflamingo's takeover of Dressrosa.", "personality": "Trebol seems to have a problem with how close he gets to someone with whom he is talking, making people comment that he is too close. He is somewhat bold, obnoxious, and insensitive, as he casually asked Baby 5 if Doflamingo killed another one of her fiancs, as well as asking Baby 5 to marry him as a joke, knowing that it would make Baby 5 feel compelled to help him. Trebol can also act rashly and violent, as upon realizing that the Straw Hat Pirates are attacking Sugar, he instantly threw a ship at the Officer Tower without considering the damage or risk to Sugar or caring that he was destroying the expensive vessel of a crew who came to do business with the Donquixote Family while cruelly setting the captured dwarves on fire and sadistically mocking their belief in Usopp being their savior before stomping on each and every one of them. Despite his insensitive and cruel behavior, he has no tolerance for anyone who insults his family, as he grew angry when a peon giggled at Pica's voice, as well as getting enraged whenever someone directly insults him, as seen when he lunged at Law after the latter insulted him despite Doflamingo warning him not to. After Law wounds Trebol with Sterben, he attempts to kill Law by using his staff to cause a devastating explosion though Law survives after that. While Trebol is caring towards the Donquixote Family, he can be rude and disrespectful to his subordinates, even the ones Doflamingo held deep connections to. He referred to Sugar as a brat and laughed at Senor Pink's infant clothing. However, this appears to be mutual as Trebol retorted to Lao G's comment about Sugar being a child by stating she is not. A very profuse and off-putting amount of mucus tends to drip and hang from Trebol's nose (most likely because of his Devil Fruit powers), and he will often say he cannot help it, sometimes snotting more when he laughs or has been excited or startled. Trebol is confident in himself, taking the role of Sugar's bodyguard very seriously and teaming up with Doflamingo to fight Luffy and Law. He was assured about his Devil Fruit, as his mucus will subdue anybody. He also has the utmost pride in Doflamingo as he believes Doflamingo to be the rightful king of Dressrosa. He also believed if the Straw Hats were to make it underground, Sugar would just turn them into toys. Similar to Doflamingo, Trebol's arrogance and overconfidence take a carefree attitude, although it also makes him underestimate his opponents, and he will begin to panic should there be events that leave him astonished. Likewise, Trebol refused to heed Doflamingo's request to bring Sugar back to the castle, only to be utterly shocked upon seeing Sugar fainted after seeing Usopp making a horrifying face that traumatized her. When Trebol tried to wake Sugar up, he lamented the toys reverting to their original forms, which exposed Doflamingo's tyranny. When Luffy and Doflamingo clashed, Trebol was shocked to see that Luffy can use Haoshoku Haki like Doflamingo. In spite of this, Trebol believed Luffy to be incapable of defeating Doflamingo. After Trebol got insulted by Law's claim that Doflamingo was just using him and the other Elite Officers as puppets, Trebol took it upon himself to kill Law as he believed he could not do anything since he was bound by his mucus. However, it greatly cost him as Law manipulated his severed arm that was holding his sword into cutting him. Being seriously wounded, he tried to kill Law to the point of using a suicide attack. Trebol is worshipful of Haoshoku Haki, as he claims it to be a quality of a king. Doflamingo's usage of Haoshoku Haki was the reason Trebol and the other Elite Officers took him under their wing and did whatever he wanted. Like many One Piece characters, Trebol has a distinct laugh: \"Behehehehe\". He also has a unique speech pattern, frequently beginning his sentences with \"Ne\" or \"Ne, ne\" (which translates to \"Hey\", or \"Hey, hey\"), and in some cases, though uncommon, he will repeat \"Ne\" more than twice in a row. He speaks in a very nasally manner, causing the words to sound more along the lines of \"Nyeh\", or \"Nyeh, nyehh\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Trebol occupies the Club seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself, and is the staff officer of his pirate crew. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Trebol Army, with Sugar, Violet (before her defection), and Giolla, all of whom specialized as a special powers team, as his subordinates. Even as an 18-year-old, Trebol was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Diamante, and Pica, all of whom are younger than him. At 39 years old, Trebol, along with Diamante and Pica, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Alongside Diamante, Trebol defeated the dozens of ex-toys who tried to destroy the SMILE Factory without even receiving a single injury. Trebol was knowledgeable of Haki even before hemet Doflamingo, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki are qualified to become king."},

He wears a black suit over a black tie and a white buttoned shirt, as well as black pants. In the anime, he initially had a short white beard, but lost it after the timeskip.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Warcury cares about the balance in the world maintained by the Three Great Powers and wishes to maintain it. He appears to be patient, as he was content to observe Shanks' potentially threatening actions and not rush to intervene. However, he cursed Crocodile and Luffy for threatening the balance when the latter removed the former from the Seven Warlords of the Sea, saying that Luffy could not be forgiven. He also wishes to preserve the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. He appears to take positions of authority seriously, as he disapproved of Admiral Aokiji going off on his own without telling anyone. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral, but Warcury was especially abrasive toward Sakazuki, reminding him of his place and failures by mentioning how Aokiji had joined forces with Blackbeard. He takes rebellion very seriously and said the annihilation of the Lulusia Kingdom could serve as an example to other unsettled governments. Compared to the other Elders, Warcury has appeared to display shreds of conscience regarding the lives of his subjects. When Imu ordered for the Lulusia Kingdom to be annihilated, Warcury brought up the fact that the kingdom was heavily populated; however, he had no qualms about going through with it once Imu reaffirmed the decision. He also seems to value racial harmony, as he was displeased to hear of Jinbe's resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea, which had maintained bonds between humans and fish-men.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Five Elders, Warcury is one of the few to have the \"highest authority of the World Government\", being above even the World Nobles. He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is Imu."},

{"name": "Usopp", "episode": "Episode 23", "chapter": "Chapter 8", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "Usopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly hair, prominent lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion to Pinocchio (a wooden boy from a story of the same name who possessed a nose that would stretch after he lied). Usopp inherited his famous nose from his mother, while the rest of his face closely resembles his father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in the Boin Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating. Like the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the majority of the series before wearing different clothing by the end of the Paradise. Usopp usually wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue and white striped armband on his left arm, along with special sniper goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular goggles that he sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his sniper goggles were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash and no shirt underneath. He also carries with him a yellow satchel, which he stores all his tools and gadgets in. During the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown jumper with white fur collar and cuffs, faded yellow gloves and grey pants with a black \"c\" pattern. During the walk through the desert in the Arabasta Arc, he wore a brown keffiyeh under his goggles and a dull red (blue in Volume 19 cover, and dull green in the anime) and black striped desert cloak. During the Skypiea Arc, he wore a murky green shirt underneath brown overalls and some bandages on his torso and arms after getting attacked by Enel. During the final game of the Davy Back Fight, he wore a yellow zip-up coach jacket, a red towel around his shoulders, and silver sunglasses with purple lenses. Usopp was also trusted with Luffy's straw hat which he wore on his head. During the Water 7 Arc, he wore bandages under his overalls again after being attacked by the Franky Family. While onboard the Puffing Tom he put on a gold colored sun-like mask he found in a compartment over his goggles and wore a red cape, calling this superhero persona \"Sogeking\". Usopp wore this costume for the rest of the Enies Lobby Arc. During the Thriller Bark Arc Usopp wore a purple cape and a wide brim purple hat with a necklace of garlic to ward off evil creatures. During Sabaody Archipelago Arc Usopp wore an unbuttoned turquoise shirt instead of his overalls and some green shorts with a yellow flower pattern on one leg.", "personality": "Since first introduced, Usopp has been cowardly, known to constantly lie and enjoys telling tall tales to both friends and strangers alike. He is generally seen as the comic relief of the Straw Hats as well as the weakest member of the crew. Despite his cowardly disposition, he is unselfish, compassionate, and strives to become a great pirate as well as better himself. He also works hard to keep the crew safe and help his fellow crew members accomplish their own dreams as well as his own. Usopp is one of the more sentimental Straw Hat Pirates, and cries or loses his temper in moments of emotional stress. At the start of the series, Usopp was an easily frightened, anxious, insecure, and compulsive liar. Unlike Nami (whose cowardice is linked to just wanting to stay alive), Usopp's cowardice was the result of his fear and insecurity, especially when faced with uncertainty. Usopp is able to put aside his fear during more desperate times: despite being afraid, he faces those fears for the sake of his friends and people he barely knows.", "abilities_and_powers": "According to Oda in a discussion with Mayumi Tanaka, Luffy's voice actress, 'no matter who joins, he always wants Usopp to be the weakest' since it would upset the balance of the story. Oda also states that this is because Usopp is the only one in the entire crew who is the closest in strength as compared to a regular human. Since early in the series, he has struggled to match the physical feats of the stronger characters and needed his weapons or ammunition to take out foes. He used to be a huge coward and often wanted to run away immediately, a trait he still carries to a lesser extent after his two years of training. This, coupled with him getting easily distracted or confused in battle have often made him less effective than his real potential as a sniper. So far, he appears to have moved past this after his training and takes better advantage of his wit and strategy. Both his physical and mental strength have all increased greatly during the two-year timeskip, as he was able to quickly dispatch all of Caesar's men on his own. While many of his attributes lie mainly in his ability to hit nearly anything he sets his sights on with his slingshot, he is now shown to be strong enough to keep both Robin, Luffy, and himself afloat in freezing water. Usopp current bounty is 500,000,000, being the sixth highest bounty within the Straw Hat Pirates (after Luffy, Zoro, Jinbe, Sanji and Robin). However, rather than being a reflection of his fighting abilities, Usopp's bounty being higher compared to some his crewmates is largely because he always manage to stand out during the major incidents he's been in. At Enies Lobby, Usopp was the one who burned the World Government flag and prevented Spandam from taking Robin past the Bridge of Hesitation with his sniping, earning him (as Sogeking) a bounty of 30,000,000, higher than Nami and Chopper who defeated CP9 agents. At Dressrosa, Usopp became known across Dressrosa as 'God' Usopp after knocking out Sugar and breaking the Hobi Hobi curse, making him the man responsible for exposing Doflamingo true nature to Dressrosa, getting him a bounty of 200,000,000, the third highest among the crew at the time."},

Twenty two years ago, he wore the same clothes, but had a less wrinkled face, and a shorter beard, which was black.

Because of his absent-minded nature, he tends to behave recklessly and sometimes acts without thinking or taking important things into consideration, as he tried to set a world record for the tallest pair of stilts in the world, but didn't consider how he'd get down or that he'd be afraid of heights, resulting in him being stuck for 10 years, and also ate some milk that has gone bad and curdled for a very long time, resulting in him getting food poisoning.

Like the other okama on the island, he has a desire to convert others into okama as seen with his interactions with Sanji. He is also quite playful, especially when trying to convert Sanji and believed chasing him around was fun. However his actions may come off as somewhat intimidating due to his forceful behavior, especially when he tried to catch Sanji with a net in order to make him wear a dress.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tibany is strong enough to capture Sanji and force him to dress as an okama.

{"name": "Tetsu", "episode": "Episode 948", "chapter": "Chapter 947", "year": 2019, "note": "His name was revealed in the captions of Episode 947.", "appearance": "Tetsu is a man of average height with a crescent-shaped scar on the left side of his face. He has turquoise hair formed in a pompadour at the front and a topknot at the back. At Udon, he wore a standard prisoner outfit. In the anime, he wears a black and yellow striped kimono with a white tasuki after discarding the prison uniform. 41 years ago, in the anime, Tetsu wore a lilac kimono. In the manga, he was dressed in a light-colored kimono with a pattern of four squares that form a larger square. In those days, he also did not have a scar on his face.", "personality": "Tetsu holds strong resentment towards the Beasts Pirates and enjoyed seeing Luffy rebel. However, his spirit has been broken by his defeat and imprisonment, causing him to comply with Babanuki's orders instead of taking part in the rebellion. In the anime, he also showed himself to be a rather restless person, which forced Hyogoro to calm him down. Before Kozuki Oden became a hero of the country, Tetsu was afraid of him and even hid his pig from him so that it would not fall under his feet.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tetsu has some physical strength as he managed to restrain Monkey D.

{"name": "Thatch", "episode": "Episode 440", "chapter": "Chapter 325", "year": 2006, "note": "", "appearance": "Thatch was a tall man with a light brown pompadour hairstyle, which went to a point at the back of his head, and a goatee around his chin. He also had a stitched scar running down his face, around his left eye, reminiscent that of Garp. Thatch often dressed in a posh uniform, with calf-long pants and a black belt around his waist, and brown shoes. Initially in the anime, he was given blonde hair spiking out rather than being arranged in a pompadour and his goatee was black. He wore a white foulard, a blue shirt, and gray pants with a sword on his right hip. Later in the anime, he was given a different color scheme. His hair was changed to orange brown, his foulard became yellow, and his entire uniform changed to a much lighter blue, with his shirt and pants the same color.", "personality": "Jovial and affable, Thatch appeared to be one of the friendlier and more sociable commanders of Whitebeard's crew, being the first to interact with Ace after they captured him and the rest of the Spade Pirates. He also may have had a confident side, having chosen not to devour the Yami Yami no Mi after retrieving it from a raid, as according to the Whitebeard Pirates, the finder of the Devil Fruit has the right to consume it. However, this turned out to be a fatal mistake, as Teach took advantage of it and murdered Thatch for that very fruit.", "abilities_and_powers": "Having been a division commander, he had authority over a vast number of subordinates. He was also recognized as one of the strongest pirates on board. His strength was also praised by Ace after seeing him fight the Raccoon crew. In the anime, it can be seen that Teach had to resort to a surprise attack to kill him. Thatch was shown to be a skilled chef responsible for providing nutritious food for his aging captain. Following Thatch's murder, his crew was unable to cook meals of the same quality, and Whitebeard's health started to deteriorate faster as a result."},
{"name": "Tony Tony Chopper", "episode": "Episode 134", "chapter": "Chapter 81", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Most of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more \"chibi\" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed. A running gag is that various characters in One Piece think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as \"a raccoon\") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form. The word \"tonakai\", which is the Japanese word for \"reindeer\", is where the \"Tony\" in Chopper's name is derived from. His Heavy Point or human form is likewise mistaken for a gorilla (or an abominable snowman on his home island).", "personality": "Chopper is nave and extremely timid towards unfamiliar humans, often acting like a child because he does not know any better. Like Luffy, he is easily impressed at things like beams, cannons and hidden abilities. He is a coward at times like Usopp and Nami, although his cowardice can be attributed to his childishness and overall lack of trust in his own fighting skills (a contrast to Nami's self-survival-based cowardice and Usopp's insecurity-based cowardice). He would rather run and hide than fight but becomes more courageous when others are there to support him. Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anyone on his team as a role model and in some cases, imitate their behavior, especially Usopp. Being the youngest, Chopper is the most emotional Straw Hat and very much considers the crew his \"family\", when forced to be part of the Foxy Pirates during the Davy Back Fight Chopper was distraught and cried that he was a Straw Hat and only stopped bawling when Zoro ordered him to \"man up\". After the timeskip, Chopper seems to have grown more confident, much like Usopp. He no longer strives to be looked at as a human, now only wanting to \"be a monster that can help Luffy\" as he put it. He even has grown mature enough to smack his crewmates, mostly Zoro and Luffy, when they try to do something stupid or extreme.He also seems to have outgrown most habits mentioned above, but his habit of peeking still remains. Chopper is capable of romance, though he shows no interest in human females. However,he was blushing around the reindeer mink,Milky, acting in a very Sanji-like manner with love hearts replacing his eyes.", "abilities_and_powers": "Typically, it is rare for doctors to fulfill roles other than medical practices for the benefit of those around them, but as the Straw Hat Pirates' doctor, Chopper's responsibilities are not limited to just medicine alone. He occasionally performed tasks like steering the ship as their unofficial helmsman while on the Going Merry, and during the heat of battle, he can also fulfill the role of a physical fighter to support his friends. However, due in part to his lack of battle experience or formal training (as well as his Rumble Ball's time limited effect) Chopper was originally considered part of the \"Weakling Trio\" along with Nami and Usopp. This lay largely in his lack of battle intuition and navet at the time, though it is shown that he has gotten much more capable after his two years of training on Torino Kingdom. In spite of his usual fearful behavior, Chopper is shown to have a strong will as he withstood a burst of Haoshoku Haki from Big Mom."},
{"name": "Trafalgar D. Water Law", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "His true name was revealed in Chapter 763.", "appearance": "Law is a slim young man of a relatively tall height. He has faint shadows right under his yellow eyes (grey in the anime), and his face is usually seen with a smirk. He wears a northern-style fur hat, which is white and has a spotted pattern along the bottom and the bill. He has short dark hair, a majority of which is obscured by his hat, save for his sideburns and a small goatee. His hair color is depicted as black in both the anime and manga, though sometimes the manga depicts it as blue. He has many tribal-style tattoos on his arms; on both of his hands are letters spelled as D E A T H tattooed in black on each of the back of his fingers. Originally in the manga, his right hand was not tattooed while his left thumb had the letter A missing. Later on, all of his fingers were tattooed completely with all five letters. He also has a black cross on the back of both of his hands. On his chest, he has a tribal-style heart tattoo with his Jolly Roger on it. He has a simpler heart tattoo on his shoulders and his Jolly Roger tattooed on his back.", "personality": "While still a young boy attending a doctor's academy in Flevance, Law was a very kind and devoted child, refusing to leave his family behind despite falsely promised evacuations at hand, and aspiring to become a great doctor like his father while happily going to festivals with his beloved little sister. Upon the destruction of his homeland, the annihilation of his classmates and family, and diagnosed with no more than thirty-eight months to live, Law suffered a mental breakdown and, according to Doflamingo, came to be known for being very cruel and nihilistic, intending to join the Donquixote Pirates so he could \"destroy everything around him\". Only after having been cured of his illness by Corazon did Law have a change of heart. Present Law is an extremely laid-back yet scheming man, who is nearly always seen calmly smiling when not put into a tense situation. Not eager to directly clash with potential enemies, Law prefers to be patient and only act when the time is right, choosing to stay out of unnecessary conflict and wait for a valuable opportunity to further his goals, like his deliberate choice to not rush his entrance into the New World and subsequent promotion into the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Also, while Law does not like starting or being involved in commotions that may attract unwanted attention towards himself, he enjoys spectating the chaos initiated by others, like a fight between two other Super Rookies or the destruction the Straw Hat Pirates were bringing to the Human Auctioning House in the Sabaody Archipelago. After the time-skip, Law does not smile as much anymore, displaying a more cautious, observing expression on his face. In fact, he tends to only smirk when feeling pleased that a plan went as intended or while attempting to provoke an enemy. That being said, Law has a bolder attitude when faced against other infamous pirates, especially his peers from the Worst Generation. For example, he casually asked X Drake how many people he had slain in his very first appearance and had no qualms about rudely gesturing to Eustass Kid, the most wanted rookie pirate on the Sabaody Archipelago who had a reputation for killing people for the most minor of reasons, even smiling defiantly when doing so. Law has also done this same gesture towards Donquixote Doflamingo both to provoke and display his contempt for his former captain, despite being close to death and threatened at gunpoint at the time. Reflecting this boldness, Law self-admittedly hates being ordered around; however, he is reasonable enough to understand when his immediate crew and are in a pinch, not being above resorting to brief alliances with rivals if it meant survival. Surprisingly, belying his usual cool attitude, Law can be quite prideful and even childishly competitive, particularly when next to Luffy and Kid.", "abilities_and_powers": "In his youth, after Law realized he was dying, he went to Doflamingo to join the future Warlord of the Sea's crew, planning on causing as much devastation as possible to the world before dying. Doflamingo accepted Law, and while part of the Donquixote Pirates, he learnt marksmanship from Gladius, martial arts from Lao G and swordsmanship from Diamante, in Doflamingo's hope that they would find a cure for Law and raise him into being the third Corazon. Law is shown to have a very strong will as he, along with most of his crew, proved resistant to Rayleigh's burst of Haoshoku Haki that took out almost everyone in the Auction House. This feat caused Rayleigh to comment on him being a fearsome pirate. He was also able to withstand the clash of Haoshoku Haki between Luffy and Doflamingo. Like Jinbe and Eustass Kid, Law is also immune of Big Mom's \"Soul Pocus\" when showing he has no fears towards the Emperor. Even Donquixote Doflamingo commented to his subordinates at Punk Hazard about Law's potential while comparing it to Luffy's, which Doflamingo witnessed himself during the war at Marineford two years ago. Doflamingo saw talent in Law and intended to make him into his right-hand man. He reserved the Heart seat for Law, showing that the latter is considered on the same level as the elite officers of the Donquixote Family. Vergo was only able to keep ahead of Law because he had the latter's heart at the time, a situation that immediately reversed after Smoker (reluctantly) helped Law to retrieve the organ. He is also apparently quite fearless, as he allowed several Marines to get within close-range of him on Sabaody Archipelago, despite being a long-range fighter. During their stay at Sabaody Archipelago, the Kid Pirates and Heart Pirates were caught in a battle with a Pacifista. The end of the battle was unseen, but since they reappear during the Marineford Arc, it can be assumed that they either defeated the Pacifista or managed to elude it. Kizaru mentioned that the Heart Pirates did a good job at running away. Sometime during the timeskip, Law became so powerful and infamous that even the ruthless G-5 Marines were deeply fearful of him. His bounty soon surpassed Luffy's at the time, and brought a hundred pirates' hearts to the World Government, earning his position in the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Law battled and defeated Smoker, a Vice Admiral and Logia user without getting injured. He later defeated Vergo in one move, whereas in the past, it was impossible to hurt him because of his powerful Busoshoku Haki. In Dressrosa, he was strong enough to face and counter attacks from the Admiral, Fujitora, and fellow Warlord, Doflamingo at the same time; then dealt severe damage to the latter near the end of the arc, but could not defeat him. In Wano Country, Law was able to injure the Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom, both being known for their nigh-impenetrable durability throughout their battle, earning recognition from them. During both his and Kid's fight against Big Mom, his awakened powers were able to deal significant damage to the Emperor who soon empowered herself with a year of her lifespan, while wielding her special Homies, Hera, Prometheus, and Napoleon, all of which had become stronger and more in-sync. In the end, due to their joint efforts and nullification of her Devil Fruit powers, he and Kid were able to defeat Big Mom, the fearsome Emperor. Having defeated the former Emperor, Big Mom, Law gained a bounty of 3,000,000,000, making him one of the most dangerous pirates in the world; with his new bounty matching that of the current Emperor and rival, Monkey D. Luffy. Although, his improved power and skills allowed him to fight the Emperor, Blackbeard and his crew, alongside his crew for a time, even damaging him, Law proved no match for him in the end."},

{"name": "Tashigi", "episode": "Episode 96", "chapter": "Chapter 48", "year": 1999, "note": "Her name was revealed by Smoker in Chapter 97. She is formally introduced in Chapter 98.", "appearance": "Tashigi has dark brown eyes and wears her black hair between chin- and shoulder-length. She looks remarkably similar to the late Kuina, Zoro's childhood friend. She wears rectangular glasses with red frames. Before the timeskip, she was seen wearing short-sleeved shirts of varying different colors and designs but usually covered them with her white-trimmed, waist-length blue leather coat. She tended to wear dark blue jeans with black shoes but has also paired white capris with tan shoes. Her face and hair have changed slightly several times since her introduction, especially noticeably in Chapter 439. However, it is not clear whether this was an intentional redesign or simply a result of the author's continually evolving art style and the length of time she had been out of the spotlight. After the timeskip, her hair is much longer and now pinned up by a clip. She still wears glasses, and her figure has become more feminine than it was two years ago. She was seen wearing a floral button-down shirt, blue capris, dark pink gloves with a white trim, and dark pink boots. Having achieved the rank of captain, she replaced her blue coat with a pink version of the standard Marine officers' coat. As with Hina, Tashigi's subordinates tend to fawn over her, but it is clear that they also respect her as their superior.", "personality": "Tashigi was first introduced when the Straw Hat Pirates docked in Loguetown, where she was stationed. Smoker, her superior officer, seems to regard her as a protege, and the two work very well together. Despite her proficiency in sword fighting, she is usually clumsy, which gets on Smoker's nerves. She is extremely interested in katanas, often identifying their names and origins on sight; even when in danger, she may be distracted by the presence of a famed blade. During the Loguetown Arc, she was even shown carrying what seemed to be a pocket Meito field guide. Tashigi is very brave and reckless when fighting her opponents, a trait typical of swordswomen and swordsmen. She will battle anyone she considers an enemy, regardless of their reputation. This fighting spirit often turns into carelessness and has led to her defeat on several occasions, much to Smoker's disdain. Two examples would be her fight against Nico Robin, during which her knee was broken, and her fight against Law, during which she was cut in half. She is also stubborn and may refuse to accept defeat if she feels she has been looked down upon, as seen when she demanded a rematch with Zoro, indignant that he did not cut her down. She even refused to give up after Law separated her torso from her legs and chopped Shigure in half. Her endless determination could be interpreted as a \"sore loser\" attitude, but it seems to derive from her desire to protect what is important to her. Like Smoker, Tashigi's definition of \"justice\" differs from that of the Marines as a whole, and she does not hesitate to fight in its defense. Her stated goal is to remove all Meito from the hands of those who would use them for their own selfish ambitions. Despite her distaste for pirates, Tashigi is willing to work with them and abandon her Marine pride if she deems it necessary for the greater good. Tashigi felt that, as a swordswoman, she would be perceived as inferior to swordsmen by default, and she accused Zoro of refusing to cut her because of her gender. She also felt insulted when Law cut her without killing her. As a swordswoman, she would rather face death than be shamefully defeated. However, this does not stop her from trying hard to get stronger and achieve her dreams. Tashigi wears her shirts buttoned up higher and shows less cleavage than many other female characters, indicating that she is somewhat reserved about her body. This was especially apparent when she was trapped in Smoker's body, as she wore his jacket fully closed and protested heavily when Smoker (trapped in her body) took off her bra and wore her shirt completely unbuttoned. Her shyness was also shown when she screamed in embarrassment after returning to her body and finding it in that state of undress. One of Tashigi's most prominent character traits is her absentmindedness. When Smoker was chasing after Luffy during the Arabasta Arc, she failed to recognize the situation until Smoker told her what to do. In the anime, she had a brief but polite interaction with Chopper without realizing that he was a talking reindeer. The most significant example of her oblivious nature was when, in the Loguetown Arc, Tashigi spent a very long time failing to realize that the three-swords-carrying, haramaki-wearing swordsman she had befriended was, in fact, the three-swords-carrying, haramaki-wearing Pirate Hunter, Roronoa Zoro.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine captain, she has command over lower-ranking Marines."},

He also appeared to be overconfident as he continued to brag or laugh as soon as he temporarily gained the upper hand in his battle with Franky and Robin.

He also has a distinct laughter style that sounds like a monkey: \"A-a-a-a-a\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a General Zombie, Tararan was, in theory, immortal and powerful, which is shown when he survived a bridge collapse and a considerable fall. Hogback modified all of the threads in the spider mice, including Tararan, so they could be cut. However, as with all zombies, he was weak against salt. Furthermore, Tararan was no match for Franky's attacks, even to the point of bleeding and being thrown backwards."},

He has many wrinkles on his forehead and a big mustache that curls upwards. He also wears sunglasses and has a scar over his left eye which he lost during a previous fight with Pedro five years ago. On top of his head, he sports a magenta cup full of hot tea and saucer which he drinks from at times. As Baron Tamago, he appears to wear magenta pants with an egg shell like shape that goes up to his belly. He wears a formal magenta tuxedo as well, along with a pink shirt underneath, and a yellow bowtie. He carries a long wooden cane with him. Tamago's rather strange appearance caused Zoro to comically mistake him for a compass. As Viscount Hiyoko, he has a yellow skin color, and his arms and hands have transformed into wings. His attire changed and he has a yellow suit with white pants. As Count Niwatori, he resembles a large rooster wearing a pale pink suit.", "personality": "Tamago always uses French words like \"bon\" at the beginning of his sentences and \"soir\" and \"s'il vous plat\" at the end of his sentences. He uses \"bon\" as a suffix and prefix, but mostly a suffix. Also, in reference to his egg-theme, Tamago often uses egg-related puns. He refers to inexperienced people as \"half-boiled\" and when people surprise him with their ignorance, he even calls them \"raw\". When he says \"you\" he uses the kanji for \"egg yolk\" (?), as both are pronounced kimi. He is polite and negotiable, as well as rather intelligent, as he saw exchanging the treasure for some extra time to make more candy to be perfectly acceptable. Tamago even offered to give the citizens more time until they could accomplish the task (although the time he gave them was clearly insufficient compared to the situation explained). He even fully elaborated the protection Big Mom lent to Fish-Man Island in exchange for candy to the Straw Hats' \"Monster Trio\", along with the consequences of them failing to fulfill their end of the bargain. Like most of Big Mom's subordinates, Tamago is afraid of her. Tamago seems to dislike arrogance as shown when he admitted being disgusted by Caribou after Pekoms noted that Logia users who thought themselves to be invincible did not tend to live long. Ironically, he himself is subjected to displays of boasting as during his second fight against Pedro, he bragged about his superior speed compared to the mink's. After the misfortunes the Big Mom Pirates suffered since the Straw Hats arrived at Whole Cake Island, Niwatori became concerned of how they underestimated the Straw Hats and even warned Mont-d'Or that arrogance could lead to negative consequences. Tamago follows his missions to the letter, even at the expense of his partners, as he condoned Capone Bege's decision to shoot Pekoms because Pekoms was willing to let the Straw Hats go as thanks for their protection of Zou. Despite that, when finding out Pekoms survived and was on Whole Cake island, Tamago stated he intended to bring him before Big Mom and have the latter beg her for forgiveness while mentioning their past as comrades. That being said, Tamago is very loyal to Big Mom and her crew, and gets furious if anyone betrays them. He was furious when he found out about Bege's assassination plot against her, adding how he used to admire his skill, and was later shocked upon learning that Pekoms betrayed the crew to assist the Straw Hats' escape. Tamago also does not follow the popular trend of exposing and decorating his longlegs like other members of his tribe do.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tamago, like many others in the crew, is responsible for collecting candy payments from the various islands under Big Mom's protection, and is trusted by his captain enough to be assigned a knight rank. He is a very powerful man, given his bounty, and was able to emerge from a battle against Pedro, the captain of the Mink Tribe's Guardians with a bounty of 382,000,000, with only a scar on his left eye to show for it."},

He also has a hooked nose and sharp teeth. The tattoo on his forehead is the kanji for \"love\" (, koi?). This is a pun on how, in Japanese, the characters for both both \"love\" and \"carp\" can be read as \"koi\" He also has another tattoo on his chest of an arrow with two swirls. He wears a blueish-purple shirt with yellow wavy lines and green on the end of the sleeves, and a blue sash around his waist.", "personality": "Take does not respect the Marines and laughed at their attempt to stop Arlong. In the anime, Take has a distinct style of laughing: Gahohoho.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a Fish-Man, Take has incredible mobility underwater as well as the ability to stay submerged for as long as he desires. Like his entire race, he is also much stronger than an average human being. Despite these advantages, he is actually quite weak in comparison to strong adversaries such as the Straw Hat Pirates, especially when he and his crewmates were swept aside easily when Monkey D.

He was pot-bellied with muscular arms and thin legs. Even after becoming a Marine, his overall appearance mirrored his former occupation: he was clad in golden, sleeveless chain mail armor with an ornately decorated collar and he wore a helmet with a long, flowing purple plume on the top. Over his cuirass, he had a tunic emblazoned with the Marine symbol. He had a rope belt tied around his waist, similar to the ones worn by some samurai. His attire was completed by standard light-blue pants and shoes. It should be noted that many elements of his outfit had one or more crosses on them: his helmet, the pendants hanging from his belt, and his sword's hilt. He carried around his signature weapon, a decorated sword reminiscent of the ones used by Templars in popular fiction, either on his right hip (suggesting he may have been left-handed or ambidextrous) or hanging from his back. Also, instead of wearing the standard officer's Marine coat, he had a high-collared mantle with the kanji for \"justice\" (, Seigi?) printed on it. He tore it to pieces during the travel on the Puffing Tom in order to treat his injured comrades; however, he seemed to have repaired it or have gotten a new one in his appearance in the Marineford Arc. After the Summit War, he grew a very horizontal straight line mustache and two lined beard on his chin. In his younger days in the Marines, he had shorter hair and sported a standard Marine cap.", "personality": "T Bone was a very honorable and considerate person, and he absolutely abhorred needless violence. His main fault was his tendency to take life very seriously - although he valued the soldiers under his command, he had a tendency to fuss over their minor problems in a melodramatic manner, which could make them uncomfortable. He was noted for being far too willing to sacrifice himself, even when the situation did not call for something so drastic. Apparently, he had a penchant for dramatic phrasing, and he often spoke about honor and justice. He believed very strongly that it is a Marine's duty to protect innocent people. He had a very strong will that was shown when he left his detached train car and ran across the train tracks completely indifferent to the storm going around him. He believed every criminal he let get away leaves an innocent person in danger. Because of this, he did anything and everything in his power to catch them even if it meant claiming his own life. He claimed to dislike curved swords, such as Zoro's. His own sword-fighting style even reflected a lack of crooked swings, preferring to slash in straight motions or sharp right angles. T Bone's motto was \"Do 100 good deeds every day\", and because he disliked unnecessary violence so much and wished to protect life, he was also a vegan.", "abilities_and_powers": "T Bone was well reputed within the Marines which is why he was permanentlystationed attheir headquarters at Marinefordand later New Marineford where he reported directly to the higher brass."},

She wears the traditional skimpy wear of the Kuja warriors, and also carries a snake weapon with her. She wears a coat around her shoulders, like Marine Officers, and has a very square, thick chin. She also wears her hair in pigtails.", "personality": "Sweet Pea is mostly distinguished by her strange attribute of making quotes and adding saga/volume to the end of her sentences, such as saying, \"a race against time\" when they found out that Luffy did not have much time before the mushrooms enveloped him. She seems to follow orders without trouble, as she would listen to Marguerite's orders without fail. She helped pick off the mushrooms covering Luffy and burn them all off. She was as surprised as the others were when she found out that Luffy was male. She seems to respect Boa Hancock as any other Kuja would, due to the fact that she got on her knees and bowed to her.

Unlike a regular octopus, he has a turtle-like head without a beak between the arms. Surume has many tentacles, at least eighteen tentacles (more than double the number of a regular octopus) can be counted. Originally, Surume had a menacing look in his eyes and mouth, but after being tamed by Luffy, he was smiling and kind-looking.", "personality": "When the Straw Hats first encounter him on their way to Fish-Man Island, several crushed pirate ships can be seen among his massive tentacles, indicating that he feeds on the ships and crews he pulls down into the ocean. Caribou found it odd that a kraken would be living near the Red Line. Surume is actually quite intelligent, knowing a threat when he sees one, such as when he attempts to attack Luffy as he was preparing his Gear 3 attack, knowing that Luffy was a threat. His personality appears to be more playful than previously believed after Luffy tamed him, such as when he placed the Thousand Sunny on top of his head, and he seems to be able to understand human language. While he fears the New Fish-Man Pirates for taking him from the North Pole and holding his brothers, family, and species as hostages, he trusts Luffy enough to help fight against his former masters. He is also caring to those dear to him as he followed the New Fish-Man Pirates to prevent them from killing his species and seemed conflicted when he was forced to go against his friend, Luffy due to this situation, until Luffy promised him his brothers' safety. While Surume seems to be smart enough to understand human language and was able to sense danger, he is described by the New Fish-Man Pirates as a gigantic, super-strong, super-stupid octopus; though they were rather biased from their view of fish-men alone as the superior race.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to Surume's size, he has shown himself to be very powerful, with his tentacles long enough to crush several ships with one swipe. He was also shown destroying a ship bigger than the Thousand Sunny without any effort and knocked out Wadatsumi with just one punch. He was called the \"Monster of the Arctic\" by captain Vander Decken IX, and Hody Jones brought him from the North Pole to be a slave, needing to use his family as hostages to get his cooperation. Like an ordinary octopus, he can regrow severed tentacles. Apparently, this ability to regenerate seems remarkably quick, evident since Zoro reduced at least one tentacle to strips, only for Surume to appear once again with all of his tentacles intact after being tamed by Luffy."},

Despite being an exiled war criminal, he claimed that he still loves his country, even wearing his naval uniform despite his exile severing his connection to his home. He also seems to be sympathetic to those who had the same predicament, as he asked Rebecca how she is able to live in a country that despised her and her family, and he later joined a pirate crew whose captain was also exiled from his home country. Unlike most of the people who were freed by Sugar's curse, Suleiman isn't shown to be swayed by greed as he chose to fight the Donquixote Pirates instead of helping them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being recognized as a class A war criminal, his combat skills are presumably quite high.

She was identified in Chapter 731.", "appearance": "Sugar appears to be a ten-year-old girl, but is actually much older, being 22. This halt in aging is due to the effects of her Devil Fruit. She has aquamarine hair and dark blue eyes. During the takeover of Dressrosa, she wore a light-colored dress and a cape with bear-like ears on the hood. While she is in the underground world, she wears a white dress with light blue polka dots, a magenta hooded cape with bear-like ears, a monocle shaped and worn like an eyepatch on her left eye, and a small crown, as well as open-toed sandals. Her monocle is pink with a purple lens.", "personality": "She is loyal to Doflamingo and helped him take over the kingdom of Dressrosa. She is shown to be cruel, turning many citizens into toys and subjugating them into slavery, leaving them forgotten by anyone who knew them. She took great pride in what she did, as she was angry when the toys returned to their original forms and intended to exact her revenge. However, she still seems to have some degree of empathy as she looked a bit saddened upon seeing the dwarves' hopelessly nave faith in Usoland despite him having seemingly abandoned them to their fate, indicating that she felt pity for them. She has shown signs of childish behavior, as demonstrated when she ran around the palace, looking for Doflamingo, after he had already left for Punk Hazard. Sugar appears to be fairly indifferent about the events that happen around her, as she showed no reaction when Baby 5 attacked Doflamingo. However, she happens to have a weak fortitude, as she became utterly terrified after she forced Usopp to eat the extra-spicy Tatababasco-laced grape, at which point he made a horrifying visage of pain that scared Sugar into unconsciousness. As a result of this, she became terrified of long noses and things that looked like long noses, becoming scared when a long nosed soldier offered her some sausage. She is also capable of expressing shock, like when Trebol smashed a ship through the tower or got creeped out at the hands that sprouted on her and held her. She is smart and perceptive as upon seeing the Tontattas confronting her, she immediately realized that the dwarves were with someone else in the tower as they were quickly able of figuring out her lies in spite of their gullibility, and deduced that the dwarves had been up to something over the last year as they had not come to the palace during this time. Sugar has a fondness for grapes, which are apparently her favorite food. She often eats them off her fingers. She is shown to be quite rude to Trebol, despite the latter being in charge of her protection. She seems to be annoyed when people consider her weak due to her child-like appearance, to the point where she (literally) drops everything to show off her strength. In spite of her appearance, Sugar is highly self-assured, confident in her abilities. She got annoyed when the dwarves charged at her because of her child-like appearance, and took it upon herself to turn most of them into toys. She even stepped in to save Doflamingo from Kyros by turning him into a toy. However, she does not seem to mind having support, as she did not mind having Trebol when facing against the remaining dwarves and Usopp. She is cunning, capable of using her childish appearance by putting up a facade of innocence to lure people in so she could turn them into toys. Sugar is capable of crying on cue and pretending to offer Luffy and Law grapes as a trap, and this would have succeeded if Usopp had not sniped a plant that traumatized her again. Sugar's confidence and pride tend to border on overconfidence and a bit of arrogance that caused the downfall of not only her but also Doflamingo. When Usopp was on the verge of unconsciousness, Sugar refused to return to the castle and fed him the Tatababasco-laced grape, which led to Usopp making a horrifying visage that scared Sugar into unconsciousness, causing not only the toys to revert back to their original forms but also revealed Doflamingo's tyranny for over 10 years.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had a high level of authority in the crew."},

As an agent of CP0, she wears a uniform consisting of a white dress with a pink necktie, white matching cape and gloves. She also dons fishnet stockings with fluffy rims and a garter belt.

She does show a certain level of caution when she agrees to Kaku's suggestion that they cannot fight one of the Four Emperors without being granted permission from the World Government. Stussy has shown to be quite practical when it comes to fighting, as she prefers to incapacitate her enemies at once rather than fight them as shown when she incapacitated Kaku and Lucci. Of course, she did admit fighting them head on would have been stupid and given the situation, she simply picked the more effective method. In her Underworld emperor persona, she acted polite and disapproved of insults being thrown around, in contrast to her occasionally more hostile fellow emperors. However, she was sensitive about her age and would get violent if it was brought up. She sometimes speaks in a flirty tone.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a successful clone of a former member of the legendary and formidable Rocks Pirates, Stussy likely shares the same physical power and skills of the original Stussy. Being a former masked agent of CP0, the strongest and most exclusive of the Cipher Pols, her abilities are highly recognize by the World Government. Stussy possesses the ability to generate bat-like wings from her back and can suck blood from people by biting into their skin, akin to a vampire; she can quickly incapacitate people whose blood she sucks by putting them to sleep.

He also keeps a stopwatch on his left hip. At age 29, he lacked a mustache, and his hair was black. He wore a dark blue buttoned shirt, a grayish green cape, a yellow bandanna around his neck, and a large dark blue brimmed hat with a white feathered plume sticking out of it.", "personality": "Streusen has a great penchant for operatic singing, as he frequently sings in a deep and flowy manner be it when preparing food while doing his job as a chef or celebrating important occasions such as weddings, and can get emotional while doing so. The lyrics of his songs suggest that he views life as cruel, and full of hardships,so people should eat sweetcakes torelieve their suffering. He also displayed modesty when Big Mom praised his culinary skills. As a younger man, Streusen appearedto be power-hungry and intuitive, as he quickly deduced that a young Charlotte Linlin could help him rise back to power and so worked with her to ensure he got what he wanted, giving Linlin anything she wanted in return. This was born out of a sense of sadism, as Streusen became interested in her when she committed a horrific action that he found amusing. He was also cautious, as he maintained a distance from Linlin when first approaching her, after witnessing her actions that he found amusing. Streusen also cares for the safety of both the citizens of Totto Land and members of his crew, as he instinctively turned the Whole Cake Chateau into a cake to soften its impact as it collapsed and at the same time cushion the people affected. He is against encouraging violent behavior in children as he refused to give knives to Anana. In the anime, Streusen was enthusiastic when a juvenile Linlin uses her ferocious powers for crime in the past. Like many characters in One Piece he has a distinct laugh: \"Kukukuku\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Streusen shows a tremendous amount of leadership and guidance skills, being able to guide a team of chefs to craft an immensely intricate wedding cake, and influence Linlin into the infamous pirate she is today.

As an adult, Sterry still acts rudely to people of lower status and acts spoiled, as he complained about his lavish living quarters in Loguetown. He even treated the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp rudely because Garp was a citizen of his kingdom, and was aghast when Garp insulted him. However, Sterry can put up a facade of good manners and devotion in front of his adoptive parents. Although Sterry's teacher and adoptive parents stated that he was extremely intelligent when he was a child (though by their noble standards), he seems to be extremely ignorant about much of the world, with his views on other races being mainly based on racist stereotypes and rumors. He considers fish-men and merfolk to be no more than fish and believes they have a contagious disease, and mistook Neptune as a giant, who he believed ate humans and had saliva that could melt rocks. He has a condescending attitude around the royalty of Fish-Man Island, silently mocking their decision to explore the forests of Mary Geoise, viewing it as an ignorance of human amenities. He is also not very brave, crying in fear when Sabo threatened him, and shunning any responsibilities when Sabo ran away again. As an adult, he shrunk back in fear upon seeing a flock of crows near his bondola, worrying they could send him plummeting down the Red Line. He also became panicked when being moved on Mary Geoise's travelator for the first time, thinking it was an earthquake. He is hungry for power and does not make it a secret, as he explicitly asked Garp about ways to become a World Noble. He even showed a great interest in sitting on the Empty Throne and ruling over the entire world, despite the World Government's creed that \"no-one\" should sit in it.

He developed a hatred towards Roger for killing his old crew, and this hatred extended to Roger's son, Ace. Squard felt betrayed when he found out all of this, and due to this shock and hatred, the then Admiral Akainu was easily able to deceive Squard into thinking that Whitebeard was plotting to betray all of his subordinate crews. When Whitebeard kindly told him not to hold children accountable for the sins of their fathers, Squard discarded his philosophy of children inheriting their parents' sins.", "abilities_and_powers": "Squard has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the New World, becoming Whitebeard's subordinate in the process. His strength or ability as a captain seems to be highly respected by Whitebeard, as he was Whitebeard's first choice in leading the counter attack against the Marines. He is also a veteran from Roger's time. He is also skilled at deception.

Overall, he bears some resemblance to his son, Spandam.", "personality": "He, like his son, is a coward. Spandine was proud of his rank and enjoyed stepping on the heads of \"criminals\". He is very self-centered and did not care about anything or anyone else other than himself, and he used his power to do whatever he wanted. He believes everything he does is right and is extremely loyal to the Five Elders. Spandine believed himself to be special, and nearly invincible, because he's a Government agent. He saw himself like a hero, but acted like a child. A very bossy and mean person, he intends to get his job done and always begged for promotions. He laughed when the time came to unleash the Buster Call on Ohara, and thought that activating the Buster Call would get him promoted. It should be noted that, unlike his son, he cared for his subordinates and considered what was best for them as shown when he was shocked that the Buster Call had started before they got off and then ordering them to get off the island while stating that their lives were more important than the prisoner's. Spandine is quite dramatic; when Nico Olvia shot him, he thought he was going to die. He begged his agents to report to the boss and give the position he held to his son, only to be told that the bullet went through his sleeve.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former chief of CP9, Spandine had authority over some of the strongest agents in the World Government.

{"name": "Spandam", "episode": "Episode 355", "chapter": "Chapter 249", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Spandam is a pale man of slim stature with wavy, wild lavender hair in a layered style that is roughly shoulder-length and parted in the middle. He has black markings around his large eyes, and his narrow nose is a dark red, which leads to Franky's nickname for him, \"Spanda\". He is fond of leather, and wears a brown studded leather mask which covers the bridge of his nose and scars on his moderately high forehead just above his eyebrows, similar to the mask of the WWE Legend Mick Foley, or \"Mankind\". He also has a strong chin from when Franky attacked him eight years ago, as well as long brown leather gloves and a black high-collared leather vest with matching pants separated by a studded belt. He has white shoes with brown tassels extending from their heels, and wears a long-sleeved light gray shirt decorated with a diagonal squiggle pattern below his vest with the collar turned up. His face is very expressive, and he has a large smile that causes his slightly angular eyebrows to narrow in slightly. Two years later, Spandam's wounds have completely healed. He wears lighter clothes, a bowler hat, a striped vest, and a feathery coat. In Franky's flashback, Spandam's nose, not yet broken, was slightly longer, and his strong jawline was more pronounced. He wore a long black coat with gold-colored trim and the World Government symbol with oversized shoulder pads, a white shirt with a black tie, a gray vest with corset lacing and a diagonal squiggle pattern identical to that on his shirt eight years later, black pants and shoes, and short brown gloves. His hair was partially slicked back, emphasizing the prominent widow's peak on his high forehead, and he had small sideburns. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Based on these illustrations, it seems Spandam had a small elephant as a pet when he was a child.", "personality": "Spandam is very clumsy (he tends to spill coffee on himself during moments of excitement) and short tempered, with special sensitivity towards his name. Franky's nickname for him, Spanda (due to his panda-like markings around the eyes and nose), always causes him to lose his head. As a result, Spandam comes off mostly as a comedic villain like Buggy, though he often reveals real malice when gloating over his prisoners - as seen when he broke his promise of the Straw Hat Pirates' safety, and proceeded to beat on his defenseless captive, Nico Robin. He is not detached from the idea of exploitation, backstabbing, or the use of loopholes to get his own way, as he has proven many times in the past. Spandam is also very sadistic as seen by how he treated Nico Robin. Ironically, Spandam (as a World Government figure) is also victim to the government fabricated lie that Robin is evil and intent on world destruction. Most likely this idea was put in his head by his father Spandine. Spandam is also a great believer of Absolute Justice and believes that the end justifies the means, with the end being the acquisition of the Ancient Weapons and the means being as many murders or sacrifices as it takes. He sees himself as the world's greatest hero for capturing Robin, and is very interested in his rank and prestige, often coming across as extremely power-hungry, even contemplating using the weapons' power for his own benefit, instead of the world's - unlike the other agents, who do not want any recognition whatsoever. He has no consideration for the lives of others at all and does not even consider the loss of innocents, only having power at his command. He likes plans to go perfectly fine and gets annoyed when they do not. Spandam's main character trait is his cowardly outlook on life - even when he does not display his cowardice, he is constantly thinking about such things. He is confident only when he feels safe because he has no strength, seeing as he has a Doriki of 9 - an average Marine has 10, so he relies on others to protect him. Thus to this end, every move that he made throughout the Enies Lobby Arc was a move to put his safety above all others. Moreover, though the fault for the destruction of Enies Lobby falls solely in his hands, he uses the members of the CP9 as his scapegoats to avoid the blame being pinned on him. Though this granted him some protection, he made enemies of his former co-workers. He appears to underestimate the strength of pirates and overestimate the strength of Marines, as once he heard a transmission saying that Luffy had defeated 500 marines, he is quoted as saying: \"500? The soldiers aren't that weak!\" He also accused the Straw Hats of stealing all the keys to Nico Robin's handcuffs, instead of beating up all CP9 agents to get them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Spandam is the least powerful of the group as he has a Doriki level of only 9 (a normal, armed marine has a Doriki level of 10). Being this way, he is incapable of learning and knowing any Rokushiki moves. Nonetheless, the rest of the Cipher Pol 9 do not mind and \"respect\" him as the chief of the organization, with the possible exception of Kumadori, as he was the only one who saved Spandam from being beaten further by Franky (sending Spandam flying into the ceiling in the process). Because of his physical weakness, Spandam relies on his natural talents of knowledge and deception, as opposed to actual combat. However, despite his physical weakness, he appears to be capable of enduring considerably high amounts of damage, as seen when he was still standing after two attacks from Usopp (as Sogeking), Robin's \"Seis Fleur: Slap\", and Franky's \"Strong Right\" (in Franky's case, he also instantly counter-attacked), which only seemed to swell his face, as well as having Funkfreed land on top of him after Franky threw the elephant at him. Despite the enormous amounts of crippling damage he suffered at their hands, which left him bedridden, he managed to make a full recovery, enough to join CP0 two years later. Spandam also has many contacts, which is the reason why he was able to get hold of two Devil Fruits easily."},

She is also shown to be quite caring, and will be courageous to help those she cares about in danger, seen when she went into a battle area to find and rescue her pet mouse Chuji.

Due to its large size, it is very hard to avoid or escape from it. Smiley also appeared to be immune to extreme heat, as it could freely move over the scorching ground in the Burning Lands without any trouble. It could also shoot pieces of itself called Smilies (, Sumairzu?) in order to cross a lake or other body of water, as it was weak to water. Even though it was immune to extreme heat, setting its body directly on fire would cause it to explode violently.

{"name": "Smoker", "episode": "Episode 97", "chapter": "Chapter 48", "year": 1998, "note": "He is formally introduced in Chapter 98.", "appearance": "Smoker is a muscular, white-haired (light teal in the pre-timeskip anime) and brown-eyed man, with a distinct trait of always being seen smoking two cigars at once. His eyes sometimes appear red, such as during the Punk Hazard arc. He wears a large thick white and blue specialist marine jacket which he keeps open, with greenish fur lining the neck, wrists, and hem. The jacket bears the kanji for \"justice\" (, Seigi?) written on the back of it. Many cigars are strapped to the jacket. He carries a Seastone-tipped jitte as his weapon, although it has been broken twice: once during the Summit War of Marineford by Boa Hancock, and once on Punk Hazard by Vergo. He also wears brown leather gloves, blue jeans with a brown belt, and large military-issue brown leather boots. Furthermore, during his time in Arabasta, he also sported goggles. The fact that he rides a custom-made motorbike gives off the impression of a delinquent marine. In the manga, his hair has a white tone and the fur on his coat was initially blue, later changed to dark green, and ultimately modified to follow the anime, albeit with a much lighter green tone, and with green zips as well. During his stay on an unknown island of the Grand Line, he was seen without his jacket, which he had a subordinate carry for him. During this time, he was seen keeping his jitte strapped to his back via a series of belts. A scar was visible on the right side of his chest. After the timeskip, his hair is now longer, slicked back, and the sides have been shaved. He now sports a pair of sunglasses. He has a scar that extends from his forehead to his right eye and tapers off to the side of his face. He also added the traditional Marines' military coat over his attire, draped over his shoulders like a cape with his jitte, which has either been replaced or repaired since the Summit War of Marineford, hanging on the back; he is one of the few high-ranking marines (more specifically, a vice admiral) to not wear a conventional suit. As a child, he sported the same hairstyle as his pre-timeskip appearance. His face is depicted as being dirty, with a runny nose and a bandage on his forehead, looking as if he just had a brawl with someone. He wore a plain blank white shirt and had a pair of goggles around his neck. He wore a pair of simple black pants and a pair of simple black boots. He also wore a pair of mittens or boxing gloves and carried around a baseball bat with nails in it, and was accompanied by an exhausted-looking dog. During his time as a cadet, his hair was styled into a classic military buzz cut, and he was already smoking cigars, though only had one in his mouth at a time. In One Piece: Stampede, he wears an unbuttoned white shirt, black pants with a pink sash tied around his waist, and brown boots. He also wears a black pirate captain jacket, with the red inside.", "personality": "Smoker is a seasoned Marine soldier, infamous among his organization for his loose cannon tendencies and obstinate, rebellious attitude towards even his superiors. Many times in the series, Smoker comes in conflict with his higher ups, usually due to disagreeing with their methods of upholding peace and justice by covering up the truth or not crediting those who deserve it. Even something beneficial to his reputation, such as an award or promotion, will cause Smoker to lash out against the top brass, especially if he feels like he did not earn it. However, Smoker does show interest in climbing up the ranks, if only to widen his authority to act freely. Unlike many other marines in One Piece, Smoker does not follow the rule of Absolute Justice, following his own personal code of justice instead, which he later preaches to his subordinate Tashigi. This perception of justice allows Smoker to be flexible regarding who he can view as an ally or not, depending on the circumstances and what he witnesses during them. The Straw Hat Pirates are perhaps the biggest example of this, as whenever they meet, the Marine and the pirates often have a greater enemy in common, so Smoker lets them run free or even outright joins forces with them for the sake of saving innocents. However, as a Marine, Smoker frequently warns the Straw Hats that he will arrest them at any other time, in accordance with his duty. Smoker is an extremely serious and gruff man, and has very rarely been shown to smile, if at all. He is often sharp and caustic towards people who come off as nuisances to him, and gets irritated at silly or stupid antics that disturb his peace. However, he is profoundly dedicated and driven to protecting innocent people and his subordinates from harm. Smoker treats his underlings with the same respect as his peers and never abuses his position for selfish purposes, unlike several high-ranking marines. Despite his somber manners, Smoker does seem to have a benevolent personality, particularly regarding children and civilians. Smoker is merciless against pirates, usually taking a straightforward but efficient approach in capturing them. He is dedicated to the pursuit of global justice against criminals, and never forgets those who forsake the law and manage to escape his grasp, though he recognizes that not all Marines are as noble as their image suggests, nor should all allies be trusted blindly. Smoker holds a rather cynical worldview that makes him question even the Marines, considering the existence of traitors within their ranks a likely possibility. He also does not trust the Seven Warlords of the Sea despite their status as employees of the World Government, as he believes them to be nothing more than pirates (according to him, \"once a pirate, always a pirate\"), meaning that Smoker rarely leaves them to their own devices. This is exacerbated by the fact that Smoker has confronted no less than four different warlords for various reasons, often for knowing too much about their machinations. Smoker tends to hold grudges toward pirates who have escaped him, to the point of ignoring other notable pirates in his way. For example, he recognized Portgas D. Ace, a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, and was ready to confront him in battle, but after Monkey D. Luffy unexpectedly interrupted them, Smoker barely acknowledged Ace's presence and started chasing the Straw Hat captain, who he considers his primary target ever since their scuffle at Loguetown. It is worth noting that Smoker's interest in Luffy goes deeper than just that; Smoker has witnessed parallels between Gold Roger and the young pirate, such as a defiant smile in the face of death as well as seemingly miraculous luck. As can be deduced from his name, Smoker is an avid smoker, almost never being seen without at least one cigar on his mouth. He also instinctively prefers to walk around with his chest bare, doing so even after having his mind transferred to the body of a woman. Smoker seems to have a hobby in rock balancing. As such, he does not seem to like when people make too much noise around him, as he claims that it breaks his focus.", "abilities_and_powers": "Smoker is a formidable combatant, as on top of his sheer strength, his Logia Devil Fruit abilities set him apart from most Marines of his rank. Before Luffy came, it was said that pirate activity in Loguetown had dropped down significantly since Smoker's arrival, a testament to his competency. In Loguetown, he was on the verge of arresting Luffy during their first encounter, and would have succeeded had it not been for Luffy's father, Monkey D. Dragon, interfering. As a result, Luffy resorted to running away from Smoker every time he spotted him due to not yet knowing how to use Busoshoku Haki. After the Enies Lobby events, Smoker was shown unsatisfied in capturing a pirate with a bounty of 50,000,000 and already considered moving to the New World. During the Summit War of Marineford, he again defeated Luffy, who was already a supernova, effortlessly and could have captured him; if it weren't for Hancock's interference. By the end of the Summit War of Marineford, Smoker's overall strength had granted him enough confidence to request a transfer to the G-5 Marine Branch in the New World. It was said that the soldiers of this branch were insane, cruel, and merciless, regularly torturing pirates through various methods. They were known for not following orders, but Smoker, who is very much similar, managed to earn their loyalty and obedience, to the point of worship. With Vergo's treason and death, Smoker took over as base commander, effectively becoming the highest authority within the branch. Smoker's skills in pursuing and ensnaring enemies are regarded as top-notch, being the source of his \"White Hunter\" moniker. Luffy being the first person to ever escape his clutches is what causes him to fearlessly tackle more dangerous seas. After the time skip, Smoker and his crew managed to capture several pirates who were liberated from Hody's control at once. During his time on Punk Hazard, he managed to give Trafalgar Law, a Warlord of the Sea and part of the Worst Generation, a hard time in combat before he was ultimately defeated. He also fought fellow his fellow vice admiral, Vergo, who is also one of the strongest members of the Donquixote Pirates, on relatively equal terms, despite Vergo's superior mastery of Haki, although in the end he was defeated. Even after having his mind switched to Tashigi's body, Smoker managed to strike Luffy, surprising the Straw Hat captain, who wondered how \"Tashigi\" had gotten so strong since two years ago. Also, despite not being in his original body, Smoker easily defeated some of Caesars subordinates through his normal skills alone. Smoker has both excellent hearing and memory, best shown during the Arabasta Arc, where he was able to identify a certain Bananawani from a whole pack solely by memorizing its growl. While he may not look like it, Smoker is a clever and intelligent interrogator, easily tricking Mr. 11 into revealing his affiliation to Baroque Works through deceit. Being highly observant, Smoker was the only one who noticed the unusual icebergs that blocked their path during their trip to Punk Hazard, and was suspicious of the ever present gas that lingers around the island, both of which were being manipulated by the enemy. As a leader and strategist, Smoker is extremely efficient at his job, mobilizing his forces in a clear and concise manner during times of crisis."},

{"name": "Shirahoshi", "episode": "Episode 612", "chapter": "Chapter 531", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "Shirahoshi is a giant-sized mermaid, approximately the size of her pet Megalo but shorter than her father, and is described as \"cute but huge\" in her introduction; this makes her roughly eight to ten times the size of Luffy, an average human, excluding the length of her tail; she can hold and hide Luffy in one hand alone. According to Caribou's estimation, he put her about seven to eight times the size of a human-sized mermaid. Even as a baby, she was much larger than her mother and brothers, but still small enough to be held in her equally large father's hands. She has very long, flowing pink hair with a taiyaki-shaped hairgrip. Her breasts are large, even relative to her giant-like size, and much of her upper body is exposed. Her broadly striped tail ends in a ruffle around her waist. She tends to have blush marks on her cheeks due to her shyness. Shirahoshi has been noted for her beauty, which has been said to rival that of Boa Hancock, and Garp stated that her appearance alone was beyond everyone's expectations. She wears a cleavage-baring yellow halter top covered in pearls with a strap that widens and sticks out on the back of her neck. She also wears clam earrings and belly chains with a cloth hanging down in front. She has a very long light red and pink striped tail. When she and her family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, she wore a light-blue colored shirt. As a four-year-old, she wore a polka dot crop top with straps that floated behind her head and her tail alone was larger than her mother. As a six-year-old, she wore a light-colored crop top with floating straps.", "personality": "Despite her size, Shirahoshihas a very fragile personality. She iseasily frightened, andquickly breaksout into crying fits whenever she gets upset, such as the time when Megalo disappeared, when Luffy startled her during their first meeting, and when Luffy says that he does not like her. She is greatly pampered by her family, as she claimed that nobody ever yelled at her before and cried at the fact that Luffy was the first to do so. Whenever someone yells at her, she will interpret this as anger towards her and will start crying, while saying that the offender is scary. In fact, Shirahoshi easily tears up whenever she expresses her emotions such as joy, fear, or sadness. She can be grateful since she willingly hides Luffy from the guards after he saved her from being struck by an axe thrown by Vander Decken IX and also thanks him for rescuing Megalo. She is very considerate of her family and kingdom, saying that leaving Hard-Shell Tower even if she wants to would be a selfish thing for her to do. She is also very polite and addresses everyone with \"-sama\". She even politely rejected Decken's proposal by saying that \"he wasn't her type\". Because of her ten years of solitude, she has very limited knowledge of the world outside her tower, so she is rather curious about it as she asks Luffy about the sun, the animals, and forests, even asking him how he can eat so much despite being so small. She also does not seem to know about Devil Fruits as she called the powers of Vander Decken IX as a curse (although Decken himself also refers to his power as such). Much like the citizens of Kuja, she takes Luffy to be the norm for human males. Also, due to being locked up she has a very low stimulation level, and often becomes overly stimulated due to the events during her time with Luffy, causing her to become emotionally worked up. Because of her inexperience with proper communication, Shirahoshi accidentally offended some royals who were trying to get her attention. She seems to be naive, believing a balloon dummy to be her father and only realizing that it wasn't when she looked at it closer right before being captured (although it was part of their plan to be captured intentionally). Even though she knew Hody was behind her mother's death when Megalo confided her, she did not tell anyone because she wants to honor her mother's last wish of not holding any hatred against the killer, but this ends up being a big mistake since this allows Hody to execute his plans, despite Jinbe arguing otherwise. However, regardless of her fragile personality, she is sweet and innocent like a child which is evident when she promised to return to the castle by dinner time after leaving her tower. Shirahoshi is extremely kind as she does not bear any anger or resentment even towards people who have hurt her and her family, as despite Hody killing Otohime and later brutalizing her father and brothers right in front of her, Shirahoshi only tearfully wept. Even though not telling everyone about Hody was a dangerous mistake, this shows that Shirahoshi has a strong and gentle spirit since not hating her mother's killer even though it's her mother's last wish would be impossible for most people as noted by Jinbe, who is deeply impressed by her resolve and kindness. When Decken nearly destroys Fish-Man Island with Noah, Shirahoshi shows her bravery for the first time, putting the lives of her people ahead of her own. Even as a World Noble tried to enslave her, Shirahoshi still begged her father not to hate when he prepared to attack the noble. When the Straw Hats left Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi shows a determination to change, promising Luffy that she will stop being a crybaby.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Mermaid Princess and King Neptune's daughter, Shirahoshi has some level of authority over the kingdom her family rules, however it is unknown how much level of influence she has overall. It was stated by the Minister of the Right that her sudden disappearance from the Ryugu Palace could potentially trigger a nation-wide crisis. Being a giant-sized mermaid, Shirahoshi is able to easily lift a normal-sized person with one hand, as she had done with Luffy and Nami. Like all mermaids, she is one of the fastest swimmers in the ocean. Despite her naivete of many things, Shirahoshi has some intelligence. When swimming away from Fishman Island so that Noah would not crush it while chasing her, she realized that since the Straw Hats were the last ones to exit Ryugu Palace, the gateway between it and the island was still open, allowing her to escape the island's bubble through it."},
{"name": "Shiryu", "episode": "Episode 538", "chapter": "Chapter 440", "year": 2009, "note": "He was formally introduced in Chapter 542.", "appearance": "Shiryu is a tan man of notable height, at 3.4 meters comparable to his now-admiral Teach. He has a long face with a wide-bridged nose, a full-lipped mouth seen perpetually smoking a big cigar, and a wide, jutting, flat-ended chin. When imprisoned, Shiryu was allowed to keep his Head Jailer uniform rather than forced into prisoner garb. He had the typical officer's peaked cap with a dark-blue crown and black, low-set visor, plus a red cap band holding a frontal badge of the winged, crowned Impel Down insignia. Below, he wore what resembled a white aviator cap, the earflaps containing built-in hearing aids of sorts, consisting of perforated rings surrounding diaphragms. Below he donned a dark-blue, double-breasted trench coat that was below knee-length, ten-buttoned in gold, and with a buttoned collar bearing a red patch of the aforesaid insignia (but only the symbol) on each wing (all gold-trimmed). On Each upper arm was a red brassard with, again, said insignia, which was further borne as a buckle by the light-brown belt present for the coat. Additionally, Shiryu wore brown, color-matching gloves and boots, below elbow and knee length respectively, and dark-green pants tucked into the latter. Further part of his uniform, draped on his shoulders like a cape, was a white overcoat with the kanji goku (?) for \"prison\" emblazoned on the back. It had fringeless epaulettes consisting of red, gold-bordered rectangles marked by golden X's next to single gold buttons. The coat's sleeves were plain, lacking turned-out cuffs. In a flashback, Shiryu was seen having (as seems a trademark for high-ranking Impel Down staff) a pair of black, bat-like wing attachments on his upper back, which were no longer present by the time of his prison release. After the two-year timeskip, Shiryu has remained in his Jailer uniform, with but minor adjustments made to it. These are a color change for the coatwhile initially the same white as prior in the anime, it later becomes a light gray with white trim (and in the manga is full black)plus the epaulettes have gained a golden fringe. Every prior inclusion of the Impel Down symbol has been replaced with a plain Jolly Roger skull, though on the cap and belt buckle, the wings and crown remain.", "personality": "Shiryu is a bloodthirsty psychopath who seems to enjoy killing people any time he can. He used to exploit his Head Jailer privileges extensively to massacre many prisoners within the walls of Impel Down, just for sheer pleasure, justifying his acts by reasoning that none would care if he disposed of \"trash\". He further had no qualms about cutting down his ex-subordinates, starting to do so right after being released from prison and initially giving a sarcastic apology after the fact. Shiryu is fond of his blade and seems to relish testing it against others, even if they are far below his level. He is also shown taking personal care in maintaining his sword. Generally, Shiryu tends to keep a calm, cool-headed demeanor even in tense or unexpected situations, his relaxed smile rarely leaving his face. His cautious side is shown by his warning the Blackbeard Pirates not to underestimate Magellan or when lecturing them on how they should have prepared themselves more properly for the New World. By nature, Shiryu appears rather deceitful and treasonous, shown first by his offering to help Magellan fight for the prison if released, only to betray his former superior immediately and wreak havoc, killing his ex-subordinates mercilessly (although under the knowledge that his death sentence was only postponed, not retracted, giving him little choice outside of betrayal to escape it). While having since become a fairly loyal member of the Blackbeard Pirates, he originally voiced (in a joking manner) an intent to leave the crew if Blackbeard failed to obtain Whitebeard's power, showing a propensity to mistrust and doubt those who have yet to earn his respect; after Blackbeard's success however, Shiryu remarked on how joining him was a good decision. Still, Blackbeard himself made note of Shiryu's supposed shadiness after the timeskip, comparing him in that regard to Kuzan; Jesus Burgess, however, declared that while Kuzan was untrustworthy due to his former Marine background, Shiryu was not because of his cruelty. While Shiryu believes that the Seven Warlords of the Sea are just pirates, claiming \"once a pirate, always a pirate\" when the Impel Down staff referred to Blackbeard as a traitor, he was fully willing to aid the Blackbeard Pirates (especially since doing so enabled his liberation) and even become a member himself, thus seeming to lack a disdain for the nature of piracy in itself. Further, Shiryu (like most of his current comrades) is a fatalist, believing that it was fate that brought Blackbeard to him, and that fate told him to join the crew. Shiryu also does not seem to care much about personal details, especially if pertaining to relations he cut off; when asked by Fleet Admiral Sengoku about what happened to Magellan, he told him to find out for himself. Still, be they jailers or pirates, Shiryu seems to have a strict disposition toward his associates, shown, again, by his annoyance for his then-new pirate comrades not doing proper preparations for the New World. Shiryu seems to like smoking, as when he was let out of his prison cell, the first thing he wanted was a lighter for his cigar. On top of that, he is revealed to have a perverted side, with Oda stating that he would use his new Devil Fruit powers to spy on women's baths (like the power's previous user).", "abilities_and_powers": "As former Head Jailer of Impel Down, Shiryu held one of the highest ranks in the fortress. He commanded comparable respect to the Chief Warden himself until his abuse of power led to him being stripped of his post and privileges. After the timeskip, Shiryu has become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" that personally guard the Emperor, gaining great authority in the crew as captain of its second ship. Combat-wise, Shiryu is attested to be very powerful, not least by his current standing in an Emperor's crew. During his time in Impel Down, Shiryu was said to be equal in strength to the Warden himself, Magellan, and since the latter's bowel issues restricted his active time in the prison, Shiryu was deemed to be more dangerous. According to Ivankov, Impel Down was impregnable under the joint protection of Shiryu and Magellan, and had Shiryu been still on duty rather than imprisoned, Luffy and Bentham would not have been able to break as far down into the prison as they had. Magellan was even willing to entrust Shiryu on his own with handling the adversarial presence of Blackbeard (at the time a Warlord of the Sea) and his crew in the prison. Prior, the Chief Warden had deemed Shiryu himself such a menace as to place him in Level 6 where only the most powerful, dangerous criminals are held.

He also wears a belt that has the kanji for forest engraved upon it. Due to not having cut his hair in twenty five years, his hair is so long that its entire length is almost as long as Shoujou's entire body height. Despite looking like another species, he is actually a human. After the timeskip he has removed his coat and has replaced his captain's hat with a wide brimmed straw hat. He is also seen with a container with the beetle Luffy gave him in it hanging from a strap that goes across his chest.", "personality": "Shoujou shares his brother's short temper and territorial attitude, but unlike him, he is more laid-back and dislikes being referred to as a monkey. Still, he befriends the Straw Hats with the same ease. Despite his friendly attitude, he does think highly of his power and abilities. He confidently states that he is the logical replacement for Crocodile as a Warlord of the Sea, despite clearly being nowhere near Crocodile's level of power. He has the habit of telling trivia about his own life to others, asking them if they are impressed about it, but is usually ignored. Like his brother, he is protective of Cricket, who they have come to know as a father figure.

She is extremely serious when it comes to overthrowing Orochi as she became frustrated when Kin'emon's plans began falling apart. When suspecting that the captured Heart Pirates were responsible for leaking the plans, she went as far as to say that the captured should be silenced.

Despite not liking Zoro's company at first, he took interest in the boy and gave him real swords to help with his training, showing that was still capable of sympathy. He was also very aware about the nature of named swords, showing particular pride for Enma, his masterpiece.

Although he is always seen smiling, he gives the impression of being a mostly emotionless person.

He had tiny blush marks on his cheeks, stubble around his mouth, and a thin mustache on his upper lip. Like the other residents of Ebisu Town, he was always smiling due to eating a SMILE. His epithet came from how his thick blue afro spiked out like hedgehog spines. Kanjuro and Shinobu did not recognize him until they saw it. As Tonoyasu, his hair was covered by a bandana with purple polka-dots and tied in a top knot. He wore an orange kimono with stitched patches and waraji sandals. Over 25 years ago, Yasu's face was much cleaner and less spherical; he wore a dotted kimono with a dark robe over it. He also appeared to be much taller than he was in the current storyline.", "personality": "Yasuie was always shown smiling. He was very easily excited, as he gushed over Zoro's accomplishments and showered the swordsman with compliments. He could also be self-deprecating, as he did not object when Zoro accidentally referred to him as \"Kasu\" (trash) instead of \"Yasu\". Though eccentric, carefree, and fun loving, Yasuie was extremely kind and compassionate, using the money his daughter earned to support the citizens of Ebisu Town, providing provisions to those who are too sick and injured even if it means starving himself. He enjoyed helping people, even those as amoral as Bingo, Bongo, and Bungo. His friendly and compassionate personality gave him a strong charisma, as when he joined the conversation with Kanjuro and Shinobu about the rebellion, neither of them brought up the fact that they did not know who he was. According to Shinobu, he was a strict man in the past, but lost much of that attitude over the last 20 years. He took his position as daimyo extremely seriously, especially when it came to protecting the Habu Port. In much of the same way, he expected Kozuki Oden to devote his time proving himself as Sukiyaki's heir. He was also extremely generous as not only did he give away all the money to most of the future Nine Red Scabbards tried to steal, he also gave them extra money and encouraged them to buy books to educate themselves for the sake of supporting Oden. He was also perceptive as he was hesitant believe Orochi's claim that Oden stole money from him, knowing that Oden was not the kind of person who would hide his misdeeds. Yasuie was proud of his deeds as Tonoyasu. With his last breath, he declared to die not as a daimyo of the Kozuki Family but as a fun-loving jester of Ebisu Town.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the daimyo of Hakumai, he had control over the region and its inhabitants until he lost the position.

On his back, he has a tattoo of two crossed cutlasses over a circular design, which is a symbol heavily associated with the Shimotsuki Family. After being imprisoned by Kaidou, he wore bandages around his head that covered his left eye. He bore a striking resemblance to his grandnephew Roronoa Zoro, particularly in his youth.", "personality": "Ushimaru was an honorable, selfless, and kind samurai. He opposed the takeover of Kurozumi Orochi and remained steadfast in this even after being imprisoned by Kaidou, his spirit never showing any signs of breaking. When Kaidou attempted to force his imprisoned samurai into a death game over food with his son Yamato, Ushimaru and the others showed no hesitation in refusing the food and allowing Yamato to have it, not wavering from the samurai code. Ushimaru displayed exceptional kindness towards Yamato, encouraging the boy's dream to become Oden and bearing no resentment over his heritage as Kaidou's son. Ultimately, Ushimaru's selflessness and unwillingness to give into enemy pressure led him to break out of the cave with the other samurai and mount a suicidal final stand against Kaidou purely for the sake of Yamato surviving until the final battle Toki prophesied. Although he maintained his dedication to the code, Ushimaru considered himself to be a disgraced samurai after being defeated and imprisoned by Kaidou and so humbly declined to share his name with Yamato.", "abilities_and_powers": "As daimyo of Ringo, Ushimaru had full control over the region."},

He also wore a simple khaki samurai gi and simple zri sandals. Later in life, he became a one-eyed swordsman, gaining a scar across his left eye. As a zombie, Ryuma is noticeably shorter than Brook. He has several bandages covering part of his skull face, which has no eyes and no nose, and wears a samurai gi with intricate designs more detailed than his original garb. He also wears geta instead of the zri sandals of his past life, as well as a blue stomach band with a swirling design. Ryuma's mouth is partially covered by the blue scarf he wears, his black hair has turned white, and he keeps Shusui strapped to his right hip.", "personality": "In life, Ryuma followed a strict personal philosophy centered around justice and honor. Ryuma strongly believed that saving a life was a debt that must be repaid by those with virtue, and that repaying this debt was the way of a true swordsman. To this end, Ryuma would occasionally follow the request of someone he owed almost blindly, even when it contradicted his other beliefs. He also believed that a battle should be measured by what was protected instead of how much fame was gained. As a swordsman, Ryuma had a peculiar habit: whenever someone touched their sword sheath with his, even by accident, Ryuma would immediately take this action as a form of challenge for a duel to the death. This behavior stems from Ryuma's belief that the sword is the swordsman. Despite his honorable intentions, this habit would get him into needless and bloody confrontations. Ryuma, having heard the reputation of \"King\", hoped to one day fight against him. He believed that this King must hold a great \"Warrior's Soul\" and would make a worthy adversary. The irony, however, is that he himself was \"King\"; because the name, \"King\", was given to him by the people he saved, he unfortunately did not know it himself. Ryuma also had poor money management skills. Because of this, Ryuma would often unfortunately find himself penniless and hungry for days.", "abilities_and_powers": "Ryuma possessed immense physical strength, as the force he applied in his swordsmanship allowed him to decapitate an enormous dragon with a single slash. He also cut a copper statue in half. Ryuma was also an extremely fast runner with high endurance, as he could sprint great distances, and could jump to and land safely from great heights. His physical prowess supplemented with his sword skills allowed him to sustain no injuries during his battle in Monsters."},

She wore a light pink short-sleeved shirt with a three-buttoned placket that she left unbuttoned, dark maroon shorts, and brown shoes. In the anime, while training at the dojo, she wore a white sleeveless shirt and cropped dark green pants.", "personality": "Outwardly, Kuina was always self-assured and confident, bordering on arrogant toward fellow trainees. This, however, belied her fearsshaped by Koushirou's beliefsthat grown women could not match men in strength. As she dreamed of being the world's greatest swordsman, she came to resent her own body as an obstacle, and especially dreaded the onset of puberty. These factors led to a complicated relationship between her and Roronoa Zoro, whom she often mocked as weak but simultaneously envied for being male. Eventually, on hearing him rebuke her fears and assert his own, egalitarian views on swordsmanship, she accepted him as both friend and rival.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kuina was a formidable child prodigy in swordsmanship despite her small frame, and stood as the Isshin Dojo's strongest pupil for some time prior to her death.

{"name": "Shiki", "episode": "Episode ", "chapter": "Chapter 426", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Sengoku in Chapter 530.", "appearance": "Shiki is a very tall elderly man dressed in traditional Japanese clothes consisting of an orange trimmed, a red and black kimono robe tied together with a dark green sash, and a golden chain around his waist; he also wears a yellow striped tattered haori coat draped over his shoulders. He has golden mane-like hair, reaching down to the ground, and on the top of his head is part of a steering wheel that got lodged into his head after his battle with Roger. The doctor has noted that trying to remove it could result in death, as it is lodged too deep. Shiki himself thought he looked like a rooster without realizing that it was himself when looking into a mirror. As for his facial features, he sports a golden bushy tuft of hair for a beard at the bottom of his chin, and a black goatee with pointed edges surrounding his mouth. His eyebrows are dark and pointed as well, and he has some purple spots on the left side of his face right around his right eye that indicates his age. He is usually seen smoking a cigar. Twenty years ago, his hair covered the now bald top part of his head, and the coat on his shoulders had a different pattern, with big flower-like motifs on it. Instead of using more conventional prosthesis after cutting off his own legs to escape Impel Down, he uses his own swords as prosthetic legs, which he openly shows.", "personality": "Shiki is an ambitious man with a strong desire to rule the world, believing that, together with Roger, he could have easily done so. He values power, and respects those who have it, enemy or not. For this reason, he believed Roger being executed in the East Blue, the weakest of the Four Blues, was nothing short of humiliating considering the status the Pirate King had attained. According to Garp, he is not the type of person who could tolerate a peaceful era for long, but also added that Shiki would not instigate something big without extensive planning and preparation beforehand. This strongly implies that Shiki had the drive and mindset of a warmonger. Shiki has a knack for planning, often coming up with grandiose ones that can be incredibly long-term, and even Whitebeard seems to warily view him in this regard. He is also usually a calm person at most times and upon being notified by Doctor Indigo that the development of the SIQ formula on the fauna of all sixteen floating islands would require a period of twenty years to accomplish, Shiki was completely happy to wait that long, indicating a high degree of patience and devotion to maintaining his plans. Occasionally though, his anger and wrath would cause him to perform reckless maneuvers that contradicted his cunning mentality. Shiki was also shown to be a very charismatic and capable leader, managing to develop pirate armadas on at least two occasions in his career (the first was commented as being an exceptionally large fleet even in the New World; the Whitebeard Pirates division total is 1,600 pirates as a comparison, and the second looked to be nearly as large had Shiki not been stopped prematurely); he also treated his direct crew with compassion and respect, as if they were his own family, though he was not above killing lesser subordinates for the most superficial of reasons. Shiki often comes off as very light-hearted and comical. He takes most things with a cheerful smile and even getting a steering wheel stuck in his head, losing half his Pirate fleet to Roger, or cutting off his feet did not bring him down much. The only thing Shiki has ever shown fear of are storms, possibly because his fleet was once devastated by one when battling the Roger Pirates, but more likely due to the fact that not even he has full control of his flying masses when in the midst of one. Shiki also seems to be a little bit absent-minded, as he often mistakes things for other things, such as a giant stormy cloud for a perm, a bird for a guitar, or Scarlet the gorilla for his grandmother. He apparently likes to dance, as when first introduced to Nami he was seen performing a dance with Indigo and Scarlet. The three of them often act as a comical trio. Like other characters in One Piece, Shiki has a distinct laugh: \"Jihahahaha\" (?). In the English version of Strong World, he speaks with a Jamaican accent.", "abilities_and_powers": "Shiki commanded a large pirate crew of at least 51 divisions, somewhat similar to the Krieg Pirates and the Whitebeard Pirates, showcasing considerable military might. It is unknown how strong his crew was, but what is known is that the largest pirate fleet was under his control at that time. During Roger's era, Shiki was one of the most powerful pirate figures of the time, being on par with Sengoku, Garp, Whitebeard, and Roger as a living legend. Before that era, Shiki was a member of the Rocks Pirates, a powerful crew whose members included three of the future Emperors and was notable enough to be known as a feared peer within the group. He fought and stood his ground in a fight against Garp and Admiral Sengoku at once, two of the most powerful Marines in existence, and their fight destroyed half the city, although he ended up being defeated, he came out with only a few bruises. Shiki is also the first prisoner to escape from Impel Down on his own without help. Whereas Luffy later had to enlist the help of Ivankov, Jinbe, Crocodile, and over two hundred other prisoners to escape, his feat remains unique in the history. Ultimately, Shiki was not seriously injured and was able to emerge practically unscathed from the prison, only losing his legs(which he cut off himself to free himself from the Seastone)."},

Said hair is blond and kept in a regular, short taper cut while linking to a full beard-and-mustache combo.

He also wishes to preserve the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret at all costs, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it; notably, Ju Peter was the one who gave the order to kill Professor Clover of Ohara, doing so to prevent the latter from uttering the Great Kingdom's name. Like his fellow Elders, Ju Peter is knowledgeable regarding the true nature of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and takes said Devil Fruit's threat quite seriously. When Warcury made note of its legendary status, Ju Peter responded by questioning why the government made the effort of renaming a Devil Fruit. Although he will totally obey Imu's orders, he did not shy away from questioning the reasoning behind eliminating an entire country, though he did proceed the process regardless of the question and executed Imu's orders.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Five Elders, the highest-ranking Celestial Dragons, Ju Peter and his four peers are considered the \"Highest Authority of the World Government\", though in secret are subservient to Imu, the occupant of the Empty Throne. Ju Peter thus controls every part of the government, including but not limited to the Cipher Pol agencies and Marine HQ, with even the Fleet Admiral unable to challenge the Elder's power. Like anyone of or below the rank of Marine Admiral, the Five Elders can declare a Buster Call to destroy any island deemed a threat, as well as deploy the Mother Flame on behalf of Imu to annihilate islands without a trace. The Elders can also channel their tremendous power to manipulate the media, such as to withhold facts from the general public or outright erase segments of history, most notably regarding the Void Century."},

He has black, curly hair under a hat with points on the sides, and goggles that cover his eyes. Like most of his fellow captain-ranked subordinates he also wears a marine coat, with a dark green button up shirt under it. In his youth, he had the same goggles, but wore a Marines' cap instead, which reveals his shorter hair and pointed ears.", "personality": "As a Marine, Sharinguru has a strong sense of justice. It is unknown whether he believes in moral justice or absolute justice.", "abilities_and_powers": "Sharinguru ate the Shari Shari no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit that allows him to transform his arms and legs into wheels and rotate them at very high speed. He can use these rotating wheels as formidable weapons to drive against his opponents to inflict scraping damage. However, targets with a higher defense, such as Franky's metallic body, are resistant to this, thus proving the fruit's rotating velocity or overall piercing powers to be rather low. This power was shown only in the manga."},

He seems to be quite proficient in using them."},
{"name": "Shanks", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 3", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Shanks is a tall, muscular man with a tan complexion. Among the original lineup of the Four Emperors, he stood out as the smallest, most normal-sized human by far, the others being inhumanly proportioned to varying degrees. True to his epithet, Shanks has distinctly red hair, usually depicted across media as a deep crimson. Worthy of note is that, uniquely among all characters seen so far, even ones with a comparable hair tone, Shanks' hair is the sole one filled with grayscale in the black-and-white manga (instead of inked black or left white). Shanks' first-seen hairstyle was a straight, middle-parted one kept loosely down to nape length, with shorter (at eye level), curtained bangs in the front. In later appearances (at ten years older), he is shown with slightly longer hair, wavier and more slicked back than before except for some few strands he lets fall down the sides of his face, pushed farther sideward than said prior bangs. On his face resides a secondary trademark: a triple set of parallel, linear scars that pass vertically, at an angle over his left (untouched) eye, revealed to have been given to him by Blackbeard some unknown time before the start of the series. Additionally, Shanks' left arm is missing from below the deltoid, as a result of him saving Luffy from a Sea King when the future Straw Hat captain was just a child. As did his hair, Shanks' face changes as the manga's art style progresses: initially, it appeared more youthful, a soft jawline tapering down to a small, pointy chin. Its features were similarly milder than later depictions and, save for his small nose, also larger, most so his plain black eyes, topped by thin brows. Later appearances show him more markedly countenanced, the square of his jaw, the sharper, narrower pair of eyes, and the chiseled, more prominently bridged nose lending him a manlier appearance. More consistently stays his facial hair, however, as he has always kept it in a neatly thin connection of beard and mustache stubble, forming the beginnings of a circle beard. Clothes-wise, Shanks used to wear a certain straw hat obtained from Gol D. Roger (his former captain) that was synonymous with his image until he passed it on to Luffy. Otherwise, Shanks' outfit always includes a sweeping long, sleeveless, high-collared cape of black color (in the anime bearing a lighter, gray inside) and beneath a simple, white shirt half-buttoned up, exposing the middle of his chest and upper abs. Additionally, Shanks is always wearing pants cut below the knee, collected halfway up the shin. Initially, the pair was a slightly loose, plain brown one with golden buttons down the outer leg sides, and with a red sash around his waist to keep his shirt tucked inside. Later on, Shanks is wearing a different, mildly baggier pair of pants with a green-yellow, indiscernible floral pattern (now revealing plenty leg hair), and his shirt is left out of his sash, which is now shown holding his saber at his right side. Finally, his footwear consists of simple brown sandals, their soles gray studded. After the timeskip, he is at some point wearing different pants yet again, light-colored with a rose pattern. From 9 to 14 years old, Shanks was already used to wearing Roger's straw hat and had a similar, longish hairstyle in a middle part as his present one. His clothes were simple, including white, either plain or pinstriped shirts, occasionally a buckled shoulder belt of brown leather, an orange waist sash holding a green-hilted saber reminiscent of Gryphon, and simple (red or blue) shorts.", "personality": "Shanks is an extremely laid-back man, preferring to take his time by traveling around the world with his crew while enjoying himself as opposed to rushing from one place to another. This was already the case in his youth, where he was portrayed as playful and innocent in contrast to the grumpy and opportunistic Buggy, his fellow apprentice. However, Shanks still suffered from occasional bouts of immaturity, starting trivial arguments with Buggy solely out of stubbornness. In many ways, Shanks was very similar to Luffy (as a child) in his younger years. Shanks and his crew are almost always partying and drinking alcoholic beverages, as the captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets. He is even able to waver the resolve of prominent figures, such as Dracule Mihawk to join in with his fun, as a testament to his strong charisma. Shanks is endlessly fond of parties and will start them for all sorts of occasions (regardless of whether he had already partied beforehand), as he did when he finally met Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace. Shanks is also quite the jokester and has a penchant for teasing others. Despite his outward simplicity, Shanks bears a rather complex moral code. His aversion to conflict has led him to believe that if personal opinions conflict, no matter how close the individuals may be, it is better for them to part ways. It is indicative that Shanks prefers others to see him as someone who cares little about his own well-being, preferring to laugh off even dire situations as opposed to taking direct conflict. His carefree nature ends, however, when those under his leadership or protection are threatened, which extends to those he views as friends. As one of the Four Emperors, Shanks acknowledges that he too has a reputation to maintain and will hunt after those that dare cause trouble on his territories. As noted by the Five Elders, Shanks is a pacifist by nature who does not actively seek to cause chaos and disorder. He is also against the idea of needless bloodshed, even if honor is involved, and so far seems to only step up for a fight when a friend is in danger. He seems to admire those who display extreme bravery for the sake of humanitarian reasons, having protected and commended Koby for gathering his courage to stop the Summit War of Marineford in front of the ruthless Marine Admiral Akainu, as the young Marine believed that it was pointless to continue fighting and treating the wounded should be prioritized. While Shanks seems to always favor peaceful solutions, he will stand up and fight if the enemy leaves him no choice or if he wants to avoid further destruction to places he cares about. Unlike the some of his fellow Emperors, Shanks is not arrogant and is fully capable of acknowledging the threat his enemies can pose. In his talk with Whitebeard, Shanks admitted the scar he got from Blackbeard was not because of a mistake on his part, but proof of Blackbeard's power at the time. This allowed Shanks to understand Blackbeard had been biding his time onboard Whitebeard's ship to build up his power until he was ready to make his move. Despite his own immense strength, he does not underestimate his opponents, using Future Vision before fighting Eustass Kid and quickly assaulting him when he saw Kid's attack. When he decides that he needs to fight, he is ruthless, having the Victoria Punk destroyed and seemingly wiping out the Kid Pirates. This aspect makes Shanks more harder to defeat compared to other Emperors such as Kaidou, Big Mom and Blackbeard; he will not give his opponent any openings or play around with them. Instead, he will properly crush them. Shanks also has skills in diplomacy, which coupled with his status as one of the Four Emperors, means that his words usually carry enormous weight for those aware of his reputation. He brokered a ceasefire between the Whitebeard Pirates and the World Government because he knew that joining the fight himself would have tipped it against the Marines. Shanks managed to convince Sengoku, the then Marine Fleet Admiral, to agree with his proposition, even though Sengoku has a strong hatred for pirates. Despite being calm and brave most of the time, Shanks is sometimes surprisingly careless, acting and reacting in ways that are not always fitting to what others expect from him, a trait noted by Buggy to be \"endlessly annoying\". Those include panicking when things go wrong or shrugging off Buggy's angry disposition towards him to greet him in a friendly manner. That said, Shanks can be surprisingly serious and mature while dealing with certain topics, which runs opposite to his normal, fun-loving persona. It has been noted that he has problems relaxing while in enemy territory, causing his Haoshoku Haki to burst out of his control, even though, outwardly, Shanks appears fine. Like many of his rival pirates, Shanks has interest in obtaining the One Piece, stating his intention to start battling for it after the downfall of two of his fellow Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom. Additionally, Shanks is also aware that he needs the Road Poneglyphs to achieve this goal and therefore does not shy away from fighting for the copies himself. Having traveled around the world, Shanks believes the best sake can be found in his hometown in the West Blue, indicating a nostalgic streak. During his encounter with Whitebeard, he referred to alcohol as \"healing water\". Like other characters in One Piece, Shanks has his own unique laugh, starting it with a \"Da\" (i.e., Dahahahahaha!).", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Four Emperors, Shanks is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, and proof of that is he has a bounty of 4,048,900,000, which is the highest among the current Emperors. According to Buggy, Shanks' immense potential was visible since their days as pirate apprentices in the Roger Pirates and thought Shanks would succeed Roger as the next Pirate King. While Shanks was not interested in reaching Laugh Tale at the time, he still quickly made a powerful name for himself, gaining an impressive bounty of 1,040,000,000 twelve years before the main story. During this time, he competed with Dracule Mihawk, the \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\", in daily duels that were described as legendary. It is also important to mention that Shanks was able to reach the rank of Emperor even after losing one of his arms, and is also the only one among them, in the original and current lineup, to not have the powers of a Devil Fruit. Kaidou, who is renowned as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Shanks in the same elite class as other legendary pirates, that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Rocks D. Xebec, Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, and his former captain. As proof of this, he stopped Kaidou from attacking Whitebeard a day before the Summit War of Marineford and later joined Marineford himself a day later. Rockstar also used his captain's name to convey to Whitebeard the importance of the letter he delivered to him. Admiral Akainu fought through Whitebeard's many divisional commanders, two former Warlords of the Sea, and even Whitebeard himself, but did not challenge Shanks when he appeared. Members of the Worst Generation such as Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins had to ally with each other to have a possibility of overthrowing Shanks. Admiral Ryokugyu chose to pull back his attempt on Luffy after he realized Shanks was present outside of Wano Country. Another testament to Shanks' strength is that he was able to defeat Eustass Kid, a powerful pirate whose bounty is worth 3,000,000,000 and one of the two pirates responsible for defeating former Emperor Big Mom, with a single attack. The name of Shanks alone commands great power, as Buggy himself proved. His assertion that he previously had a \"brotherly bond\" with Shanks was one of the many things that earned him respect from the Impel Down inmates. In addition, Buggy did not shy from using the names of Shanks and his previous captain, Gol D. Roger, to maintain his respect among them. Even the fact that Buggy was seen back talking to Shanks was seen as a testament of Buggy's power to the former prisoners, who were not aware that the two had always acted like this and mistakenly thinking that it was because Buggy was not afraid of an Emperor. Shanks commands enough power to end the war at Marineford with just words. When he stated that there was to be no more fighting, no one stepped up to challenge him, even though the Marines were fired up after the death of Ace and Whitebeard. Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter stated that Shanks is one of the few people capable of stopping Blackbeard. This faith was proven valid because when Shanks asked Blackbeard if he intended to confront him, he stopped fighting and ordered his crew to retreat, despite having acquired the powers of the Gura Gura no Mi along with his original power and also strengthened his crew with many of the most powerful prisoners of Impel Down's sixth level. Furthermore, when Shanks requested that Whitebeard and Ace's dignity at death not be violated, Sengoku himself decided to call off the war and offered to take responsibility, showing that despite being a pirate, Shanks has earned Sengoku's respect, something that no pirate other than the late Whitebeard is known to have achieved. Shanks also possesses enough influence to gain an audience with the Five Elders, who like the leaders of the World Government, would normally consider him an enemy."},

She detests the weak more than anything (which is rather ironic considering she has no fighting skill of her own). She also has great pride in her family's ancestry, as she swore to make the Straw Hats suffer a living hell upon capture for what they did to her father and brother. While nave to the length that Luffy and the other pirates would do everything to achieve their goals, she was not incapable of realizing their ultimate goal. Out of her family, she was the only one who went straight to the target of their rescue and attempted to murder Camie, even if it was just a display of her cruel mentality.

He also had yellow bands around his upper arms.", "personality": "Seto was a Shandia who desired to be like Kalgara, whom he admired. When he caught the plague, he became distraught that he was going to die, never seeing his dream come true. He became one of the first Shandia to trust Noland, who as a stranger cured his disease and earned his trust. He displayed noble traits by standing in front of the cages that held Noland's men when the villagers wanted to kill them, keeping their promise not to harm Noland's men until the time ran out. However, he was quick to shun Noland like any other Shandia once they discovered their sacred forest was cut down. When Mousse explained the misunderstanding, he lived hoping for the day Noland would return. Like Kalgara, he displayed a strong desire to protect his village and cared heavily for its people.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a Shandia and training since he was child to be a warrior like Kalgara, Seto was presumably strong.

{"name": "Senor Pink", "episode": "Episode 702", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Senor Pink is a tall, obese man with brown eyes, large lips, dark shaggy hair, and a double chin. He wears a pink bonnet and purple aviator sunglasses, and carries a yellow pacifier in his mouth. He also wears a blue scarf with white polka dots around his neck with a pink bib underneath it. He wears a purple cut off, sleeveless shirt with the logo \"Let's Baby\" in yellow on it, and what appears to be small swim trunks with stars all over it that are folded over to resemble a diaper. The baby outfit is a homage to his late infant son. When he was 30 years old, Senor Pink was much slimmer than his present self. He wore a dark-colored suit with a floral shirt, and his hair was neatly combed, showcasing the signs of a well-dressed gentleman. Shortly after the death of Rosinante, Pink adopted his current appearance of dressing as an infant due to it making his comatose wife smile. By age 36, he gained extra weight after falling into depression (having started the formation of his portly figure), his shirt was light-colored and the logo \"Let's Baby\" was dark-colored. In the present, it is the other way around with \"Don't Cry\" printed on the back. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Senor Pink is shown wearing a dark-colored shirt with dirty pants, and he sported numerous bruises on his face.", "personality": "He is surrounded by many women who seem to be extremely fond of him. However, he claims to be too old for them; advising them to find someone younger, despite dressing himself as an infant. He is also shown to have some manner of indecency as he had no qualms about ripping a woman's bra off in order to wipe his mouth, which does not seem to deter the women's admiration of him, and using a shoe brush to brush his teeth. The women who admire him, as well as others, often remark he is \"hard-boiled\", while his male underlings equally praise how cool he tends to act. He seems to care about his comrades, as he took a direct hit from Franky's Rocket Launcher on purpose so that Machvise would not take damage, as he was vulnerable after having tried to crush Franky. He seems to have both a cruel and a compassionate side, calling Sugar useless one moment but then worrying about her safety the next. He is also a very proud man, as he refuses to use his ability to run away from his enemies. He even promised that if Franky could survive his strongest attack, he would admit defeat, a promise well kept. That compassionate side seems to show again, as Franky was able to trick Pink into abandoning the fight when Franky lied that he heard a woman in trouble nearby. Although Pink was angry at being tricked, he was relieved there was not actually a woman in trouble. He continues to show this side of himself such as how he protects a random cat during the middle of battle, something which made even Franky cry in admiration. His love for his wife was so strong, that he would hide his pirate career from her, as she hates pirates. However, his steadfast loyalty to his crew made it impossible for him to leave them either, forcing him to juggle between his two families. When she found out and left him, he became heartbroken, and did everything to regain her smile, even if it means dressing up like their deceased son by wearing infant clothing. Even when everyone else laughed at him for it, calling him a pervert and believing that he became so because of his loss of his wife and son, he easily brushed it all off due to the love for his wife. Overall, Senor Pink can be considered one of the kinder members of the Donquixote Family. Despite dressing like a baby and sucking on a pacifier, and his love for his late son, he claims to not like children.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Senor Pink held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers.

It is said that when Senor Pink and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory. Pink is quite perceptive, as he saw through Franky's body design, and realized that the cyborg's back remains unmodified, and therefore, a glaring weakness."},

Shakky is also highly intuitive, being able to guess Hancock's and Luffy's Impel Down penetration plan, even knowing that Hancock had fallen in love with Luffy. She also seems intent on keeping her age a secret; Luffy asked her how old she was when he heard that she had quit being a pirate forty years ago, but she immediately changed the subject, though she mentioned that she had been chased by Luffy's grandfather. After meeting Luffy for a short time, she is impressed by him, and states that she's rooting for him to become the Pirate King, particularly since she is aware that Silvers Rayleigh was the first mate of Gol D. Roger and is aware that Roger and Luffy are similar. Shakky is also fond of teasing people, like teasing Chopper into believing he had to pay 100,000 for cotton candy. She is infamous for charging exorbitant prices for her goods, but she made an exception for Hatchan and the Straw Hats.

It is not yet shown but she may have the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is one of the basic abilities found in all mermaids and some Fish-Men.

In the manga, he wears a dark cape over a dark suit with light-colored cravat and rose boutonniere, whereas, in the anime, he wears a purple shirt with a thick white collar, alongside a dark purple cape and white gloves.", "personality": "Seki is known to be a cruel ruler whose regime contributed to the suffering of his people. Even though the commoners could barely make ends meet, he still forced them to provide him and the World Nobles with tributes. On the other hand, he, at the very least, seemed to care about his country, as he is grateful to Akainu for defeating the pirates that attacked it four years ago. In addition, he seems to care greatly about his family, as evidenced by his daughter's claim that her father would pay any amount of ransom to get her back safely. Furthermore, Seki appears to be somewhat pompous, as he seemed to be skeptical that a region unaffiliated with the World Government, such as the Wano Country, could even be considered a nation. Even when overthrown and incarcerated, Seki remained defiant, angrily threatening his captors with death should the Marines rescue him and his daughter. However, he looked in horror as beams of light rained down to obliterate his kingdom.", "abilities_and_powers": "Seki was the king of a nation affiliated with the World Government and one of the few allowed to attend the Levely, which granted him some authority over matters concerning the world.

{"name": "Sengoku", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Sengoku is a tall, fair-skinned, and muscular man with a long, braided goatee and a mustache. He is usually seen alongside his pet goat. His cap covers his hair, which is set in a large afro. His afro was revealed after using his Devil Fruit powers and having his cap knocked off. Ironically, prior to the timeskip, despite already being an elderly man upon his debut (being 77 years old at the time, thereby making him a year older than Garp and Rayleigh, both men being from his generation), Sengoku displayed little to no physical signs of his actual age, with his hair still not having grayed after 20 years. He typically wears black-rimmed glasses and a white and gold full Marine admiral uniform that is adorned with medals. The most distinctive features of this uniform are a life-size seagull on top of his cap, and his oversized Marine coat which he wears like a cape. His coat has the kanji for justice, in blue, emblazoned on the back, and has unique colored cuffs, with his being white. Twenty years before the present storyline, when Sengoku was already an admiral, he did not cover his afro and sported only a mustache. During his orders to Saul to bombard Ohara, he wore less regal-looking attire than he does in the present storyline: a simple black tank top, blue jeans, and his glasses, which is unlike a typical admiral's formal suit. The only Marine-related attire he wore at the time was apparently his Marine coat, draped over like a cape. However, when he was fighting Shiki in Marineford, he was wearing a black double-breasted suit with a blue tie under his coat. Fourteen years ago, still as an Admiral, he is seen wearing a white suit with a floral button dress shirt underneath and begins to grow his trademark braided goatee, albeit much shorter than it is now. His epaulettes during his time as an Admiral were similar to Garp's, which were red and black, but he doesn't have black on it, and he never used red epaulets ever since he became Fleet Admiral. In his youth, he also did not cover his afro and he lacked a beard. As a child, Sengoku had his trademark afro, and he was seen wearing a karate uniform with a black belt tied on his waist. During the two-year timeskip, Sengoku aged with his hair turning gray, and has also grown sideburns. His former uniform is now replaced with a more casual wear during his retirement. He is wearing a dark blue shirt with red and green zig-zag patterns, orange tie with white marine shorts, and a Marine coat.", "personality": "Sengoku appears to be an exceedingly proud, enlightened, and intelligent man who was loyal to the World Government and, up until the cover-up of the Impel Down incident, never questioned orders from them. He also will not accept any reason for letting a criminal go, and also has a habit of getting very irritated with failure. His motto is \"Reigning Justice\" (, Kunrinsuru Seigi?), in that he prioritizes upholding justice over all things, although he certainly does not shy away from actions that fall under the code of Absolute Justice. From his view, the Seven Warlords of the Sea are just pirates, though he notes how valuable they can be when the time comes. However, as the years went by, he appeared to be losing his faith in the government, shown after the Summit War of Marineford when he was furious at the order from the Five Elders to suppress the second escape incident in Level 6 of Impel Down to save face and keep the faith of the people, thus placing nations in danger. This eventually led Sengoku to resign from the Marines. Before the Summit War, he was concerned over the movements of the Straw Hat Pirates, and had followed their actions ever since they departed from Water 7, though at the time his current concern was about the upcoming war against Whitebeard, to the point that he brushed off the incident of the attack on a Celestial Dragon and left it to the admirals. Upon hearing about Luffy's break-in of Impel Down, Sengoku was so frustrated that he almost took it out on Garp, and had come close to losing his patience with the antics of the Monkey family in general. Sengoku also believed that a person's birth (with the consideration of the parents' reputation) is enough to determine the potential impact they could bring to the world if left unchecked, such as Ace being Roger's son and Luffy being Dragon's son. This is shown at Ace's execution, where one of the main reasons for Ace's execution was not just because he was a pirate, but because he was the son of Gol D. Roger, and Sengoku believed that Ace must be eliminated by any means necessary, even if that meant an all-out war with Whitebeard. His epithet, Sengoku the Buddha, may seem contradictory at best since throughout the course of the series, while he has shown himself to be an extremely calm, composed, collected man, he has also shown himself to be quite capable of anger and violence. Doflamingo remarked on this irony when the Seven Warlords of the Sea convened at Mary Geoise to choose a successor for Crocodile. However, with the revelation of his Devil Fruit power, it would seem his epithet's origins come from his fruit's ability, exactly like the three current admirals (although his is not an alias). He also appears to have some common sense, as shown when he ordered the Summit War to be put to an end and ordered the other Marines to tend to the wounded, in doing so he avoided further casualties and a potential conflict with the Red Hair Pirates. His justice is not as uncompromising as Akainu's, and it seems to be more of a mix of both absolute and moral justice, as he did hold a large speech about morality. Another hint of moral justice is also shown when he got infuriated when the World Government decided to cover up the mass escape of the Level 6 Impel Down prisoners released by Blackbeard, although he once said not to question the World Government's orders. In addition, in his conversation with Kong, he stated that justice is a matter of personal values and does not endorse one form of justice over the other, mirroring Smoker's talk with Tashigi in Arabasta. This insinuates that Sengoku is more of a pragmatist in applying justice. Caesar Clown also states Sengoku is too soft for rejecting the potential of mass-murder weapons and experimentation on prisoners, in contrast to what Caesar believes Sakazuki would want, further enforcing that Sengoku is more moral than he appears. After becoming an Inspector General, Sengoku seems to have become far more cheerful and laid-back and tends to take things very casually like his friend Garp, such as how he merely laughed playfully when Issho voiced his thoughts in how Law and Luffy should be acknowledged as Dressrosa's heroes, along with the admiral's decision to not arrest the pirate alliance immediately. Tsuru notes this drastic change in Sengoku's behavior is the result of how he has less responsibilities as compared to his time in the past. Regardless, he still shows wisdom as he passed down his knowledge to the current generation of Marines about the past regarding the Four Emperors and pointed out how many world known figures have some affiliation with Wano. Though he may appear to be stern because of his duties as a Marine, he is actually very kind and compassionate. His drastic actions at the Summit War of Marineford were motivated by the desire to protect innocent civilians from getting embroiled in conflict out of fear that when the secrets held in One Piece are discovered, it would turn the world on its head and lead to total war. He also expressed extreme rage towards the World Government for trying to cover up the breakout of extremely dangerous criminals imprisoned in Level Six of Impel Down, as letting such criminals loose could pose immense danger to civilians. Furthermore, learning about Donquixote Rosinante's death, a man he considered like his own son, was enough to break his heart and drive him to tears. After the death of T Bone, Sengoku retained his serious demeanor when necessary, in spite of his laziness. He showed concerned for the civilians and how they attacked the Marines due to the influences of Cross Guild. Like his longtime colleague Garp, Sengoku's favorite snack is okaki, fried rice crackers. He is often seen munching on them, especially in his retirement. Like Issho, Sengoku's second favorite snack is a Soba Noodles.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former Fleet Admiral of the entire Marine force, Sengoku had absolute power over every action the Marines do, including summoning a Buster Call, granting and removing a Warlord's title at any time, provided they meet the criteria for either. The only ones that are above him are Imu (in secret), the Five Elders, and Commander-in-Chief Kong. However, with his resignation, came the loss of such authorities. Alongside Garp, Sengoku is one of the most powerful Marines of his generation. Both Gol D. Roger and Whitebeard held high regard for him. After defeating a group of Marines, Roger commented that he was one of the two Marines that were worth his time, the other being Garp. When Shiki was wreaking havoc in Marineford twenty-two years ago, Sengoku fought alongside Garp and were able to subdue him whilst destroying half the city in the process, keeping him imprisoned in Impel Down, a tremendous feat as Shiki is an immensely powerful swordsman who had single-handedly slaughtered an entire army of Marines before they subjugated him. Even at 79 years old, Sengoku could, alongside Fujitora and Tsuru,defeat Jack, one of the top-ranking, strongest members of the Beasts Pirates under the Emperor Kaidou."},

He is bald and has a dark mark that reaches from his nose to the top of his head. It is unknown if this is hair, a tattoo, or some other marking. He appears to have a similar marking on his left forearm. He has bags under his eyes, a round nose, large lips, and a square chin. His neck is very thick, making his head look slightly lower on his body than normal. He wears a light-colored sleeveless shirt. In his initial flashback appearance in the anime, the mark on his head is colored the same as his brown skin tone and his shirt is dark gray. In a subsequent flashback in the anime, the mark is colored brownish-orange, his skin is a lighter tone, and his shirt is light green.", "personality": "Nozdon appears to take combat seriously, as he was seen with an angry expression before the battle with the Golden Lion Pirates. However, during calmer moments, Nozdon can be seen partying and having a good time with the rest of the Roger Pirates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Nozdon's abilities are unknown, as he has not yet been shown in combat in the canon of the manga.

He wears a large maroon winter jacket with gray pauldrons on its shoulders with the number \"18\" on each of them, a black cavalier hat with a long and wild red plume, pink trousers with purple stripes, and black boots on his small feet.", "personality": "Scotch appears to be a rather passive individual. While determined to protect the island, he seems to prefer to not fight and casually warns people that the island belongs to Kaidou and tells them to leave. He clarified to X Drake that he is not threatening him but that he is simply warning him. However, when he notices that a battle is about to start and cannot be avoided anymore, he will attack. When duty calls and his services are needed, Scotch seems to have a ruthless streak of sorts, evidenced when he crushed Gaburu's rebellion in cold blood to teach the revolutionaries a lesson, and even has no qualms against attacking an old woman.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Emperor Kaidou entrusted him as a guardian of one of his favorite islands, Scotch is undoubtedly a powerful fighter. Indeed, he single-handedly overwhelmed Gaburu's rebellion, while surviving an encounter with Super Rookie X Drake invading the island.

{"name": "Scratchmen Apoo", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Being of the Longarm Tribe from the Grand Line, one of Apoo's distinguishing traits is his incredibly long arms. Each of these long arms possesses two elbow joints instead of just one, making them much longer than a normal person's. These arms make it possible for him to utilize his Devil Fruit powers without the need to contort the said limbs, whenever he converts them into makeshift instruments. Apoo also has a rather broad chest cavity, which may aid him in producing deep and bellowing drum-like sounds. Apoo's lower jaw is also somewhat wider than the upper half of his face, similar to Itomimizu of the Foxy Pirates. Besides these, his most distinguishing attributes are his unique physical characteristics and the objects adorned on him, all of which are music themed or related. His teeth have a unique look to them as they resemble piano keys. His fighting stance is also music themed as he appears like he's moving his hands in the same way a DJ would move theirs when mixing music on turntables. He wears a set of orange headphones with his name on either side over his ears and hairstyle similar to Jabra's, where the hair on his scalp has been pulled tightly so that his roots resemble lightning patterns. Before the time skip, the portion of hair at the center of his forehead was, while spiky, flattened into a square shape. After the timeskip, the center portion of his hair resembled a triangle shape while the side strips were more straightened as opposed to appearing like lightning bolts. During the Fire Festival, the side strips of hair as well as the center portion all resembled lightning bolts. Apoo wears a red gown with the symbol  (oto?, \"sound\" or \"music\") at the center of a large flower-like print splayed across the chest area, as well as on his back. His clothes are possibly inspired by the Qizhuan or Manfu style of chinese garb. Apoo also has a yellow scarf around his waist. He also has what seems to be the design of a green rose sewed on front of his left shoulder. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Apoo is shown with significantly shorter hair and a rounder face. His hair was also combed into a pompadour in the front, with his braid in the back. His attire was a less elaborate shirt and bow tie. His teeth also lacked the dark markings that make them resemble piano keys. After the timeskip, he wears a set of black headphones, and changed to a different garb that has the kanji moved to the right side of his pants. He also updated his gown with ornamental ropes, or huaniu, across the chest, and epaulets on the shoulders, evoking imagery of some high ranking marine uniforms.", "personality": "Apoo is an eccentric, boisterous pirate with an affinity for music and parties. A disc jockey by nature, Apoo employs dancing and music playing in many of his mannerisms, acting like a stereotypical radio personality. One reason he appears to enjoy being part of the Beasts Pirates is because of the \"Golden Kagura\" celebration they hold annually during every Fire Festival, making sure that he would not miss the latest. He also happens to be an enthusiastic photographer and journalist, being excited at the prospect of a news story he could potentially profit massively from. Apoo seems to be a passive individual who would not seek to harm others without a good reason. As a result, he is normally defensive during confrontations, postponing a brawl with Eustass Kid at a Sabaody Archipelago bar because they were about to finally head into the New World. Despite this, Apoo can be very curious at times, meaning he cannot deny himself an audience to an interesting battle should the opportunity present itself. When facing an opponent that is too strong for him, Apoo prefers to run away, although he enjoys provoking and taunting his enemies before leaving. Apoo is highly opportunistic, preferring to strike from a safe distance and through the element of surprise. Deceitful and treacherous, Apoo is smarter than he lets on. Despite having a bad relationship with Eustass Kid, Apoo was still able to feign cooperation and convincingly play the part of ally to him, only to later set his supposed allies against one of the Four Emperors, for whom Apoo worked all along. Apoo has a low opinion of Pirate Alliances in general, believing that they only lead to eventual betrayal. Shown to be very cunning and backstabbing, Apoo is willing to change sides on a whim with no loyalty to anyone other than himself, letting his targets fight against each other and take themselves out so he can step in at the end and finish off the last man standing. In spite of his usually outgoing and reckless character, Apoo can be rather cautious and distrustful of other people. At the end of the Summit War of Marineford, Apoo could not fathom why a pirate like Trafalgar Law would put themselves in potential danger to rescue someone, having been aware of the nasty rumors surrounding the \"Surgeon of Death\". This mindset has not changed much post-timeskip, especially when he finds himself in territory he perceives as hostile. Apoo wreaked havoc on Kid's hideout under the suspicion that a sniper could have been targeting him. He is also perceptive enough to sense killing intent emanating from others. Apoo is a gutsy pirate who knows the importance of a fight. He never starts a fight only for him to flinch later. When he took photos of CP0's agents willing to sell them to Morgans, which resulted in one of the agents attacking him, he proudly got up from the attack and continued what he started. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own laughter style: \"Apapapa\" ()", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Worst Generation, Apoo is a fearsome pirate who, with his crew, was able to survive the Grand Line's first half and ultimately enter the New World. Over the timeskip, his bounty rose from 198,000,000 (the sixth highest among the Eleven Supernovas of his generation) to 350,000,000, indicating his great strength. Despite his eccentric looks and demeanor, Apoo has proven himself quite competent and no-nonsense in battle, especially with his peculiar yet dangerous Devil Fruit ability. Using it pre-timeskip on the Sabaody Archipelago, he was able to land two effective surprise attacks on (though failed to actually harm) Marine Admiral Kizaru when none of the other Supernovas involved in the battle could even touch him. Post-timeskip on Onigashima, Apoo was able to injure both Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro in succession, leaving the former briefly unconscious from a single attack, by capitalizing on their lack of understanding (and knowing how to guard against) his powers. In general, Apoo has been seen effectively holding his own against his fellow members of the Worst Generation, such as X Drake, even with them knowing how to evade his powers. As the former informant of the Beasts Pirates, Apoo held a certain degree of authority in the organization; in particular, he seems to have the ability to command the Numbers, who are known to be extremely difficult to bring under control by other members of the Beasts Pirates."},

His hair is tied in a bushy ponytail in the back, while two thin strands of hair fall over his face. He is always seen wearing a pair of round, black sunglasses. 27 years ago, he wore a long-sleeved blue shirt with white stripes on each sleeve, which was only held closed at the middle with one button. In the anime, he was initially depicted in this outfit with lighter colored hair, silver sunglasses and a purple shirt with a yellow stripe on the collar and down each arm. 26 years ago, he initially wore a yellow t-shirt with two orange blotch-like patterns on the right side, blue pants, and a purple sash. He then wore a purple shirt, orange pants and a pale-yellow sash.", "personality": "Gaban can be very quick to get to the point, as he proposed stopping the rampaging Kozuki Oden early on before the samurai could cause more damage to the crew. He was also the first to voice the crew's dissatisfaction towards Oden after the latter joined the Roger Pirates. Gaban does not seem to care for small talk, cutting Neptune off when he started talking about Shyarly's popularity across Fish-Man Island. As a long-time member of the Roger Pirates, he understands Roger better than most and knows it is pointless to convince him to run from an enemy. Gaban seems to hold his captain to a high standard and tried to stop him from bowing his head to Whitebeard.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gaban appears to have been a prominent figure in terms of strength and authority, as he was shown leading the charge alongside Rayleigh during the crew's last battle with the Whitebeard Pirates.

In addition, he carries a large, striped cane, which he uses to control the Ball Dragon. Like other Birkans, he has small white wings on his back. Eight years ago, he looked the same, except that the rings on his jumpsuit weren't connected to each other.", "personality": "Satori was a playful and silly character, rarely seen without a smile on his face, who moves around largely by hopping and prancing. He notably exhibits this behavior while fighting Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji, pitting their lives against his deadly traps; whether this is out of childish oblivion or calculated sadism and cruelty is not known.

He appeared shadowed in the anime in Episode 954.", "appearance": "Sasaki is a bluespine unicornfish fish-man who stands at just shy of 3.2 meters, with a portly build and light skin. He possesses sharp and slanted, blue eyes underlined by notable creases, a mildly hooked nose and a set of sharp, fanged teeth with two long bottom canines (jutting out even with his mouth closed), as well as a flat chin. His shaggy hair is colored yellowish-green and reaches down to his middle back, with a golden hoop earring visible on both his ears. A black (more grayish in the anime) tattoo is located around his shoulder areas, including the upper arms, chest, and back, with many curved, vane-like shapes bringing on a resemblance to wings. Sasaki's clothes seem a distinct blend of traditional Japanese and a military/dictator's style of attire. On his head is a military cap with a black, low-set visor and a white crown that is extra-wide, puffy, dented breadthwise with the front raised, and split by a lengthwise seam. Above the black bottom edge (spaced from it) runs a black band lined with a row of gold studs, holding in the front a golden badge depicting a double-cross shape (eight-armed, the diagonals less prominent, with a small middle stud). Set below, front and center, is a pair of slender, golden horns that curve upward, lending Sasaki (together with his fangs) a rather demonic look. Otherwise, the man wears a cloak akin to a seaman's, slung on his shoulders with the sleeves hanging back, that has a folded standup collar bearing on each side a simpler version of the hat's badge. The coat has a solid-white coloration over its upper half, which ends around waist level with a downward-facing flame motif, contrasting against the orange-colored rest of the coat. Below, Sasaki's torso is bare, partly showing off the aforesaid tattoo. For lower wear, Sasaki dons a hakama-like article resembling the bottom half of a double-breasted trench coat, which is flame-patterned the same as the cloak (but with the upper half beige-colored instead of white), closed by eight gray buttons, and held up by a golden, buckled belt. Finally, Sasaki sports a pair of brown gloves and grayish-brown, double-toothed geta sandals.", "personality": "Outside of battle, Sasaki is shown to be a rather calm and easygoing man, albeit not above derision and prone to scoff at his equal-ranking peers. Still, he acts cordial toward those he considers friends, like formerly \"Kyoshiro\", but will not tolerate any breach of fidelity; if betrayed, he will aim to ensure the traitor pays a steep price. Even when he knew that his own subordinates had been turned against him against their will due to a Devil Fruit power, Sasaki still proclaimed them as traitors and was willing to personally take them out. An ambitious man, Sasaki seeks to become one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars by claiming a spot from the current ones, causing him to disregard their senior authority. This resolve, according to King, arises from Sasaki's past as captain of his own crew, bearing out on his part a high degree of confidence in his strength, enough for him to look forward to a chance to directly challenge an All-Star. Yet, Sasaki is also prideful in his Tobiroppo status, claiming that his current group is why the Beasts Pirates are as feared as they are. As far as combat is concerned, Sasaki is proud of his ability to become a dinosaur, believing dinosaurs to be the strongest animals that ever existed. Furthermore, when he makes mistakes in battle, Sasaki is too proud to admit as much and will justify his blunders as intentional decisions on his part. This prideful attitude also extends to his enemies, as he became infuriated when Franky ran from him during their fight, calling him shameless. It is implied by Kyoshiro that Sasaki is fond of partying, since the former thought that Sasaki's presence outside the Golden Kagura was uncharacteristic of him; having a fondness for drinking as indicated by his epithet, Sasaki conducted his search for Yamato with a sake bottle in hand. However, the Tobiroppo member sees himself as above drinking with rank and file, expressing his wish to drink with none other than Kaidou.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Sasaki holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, only Kaidou himself and the All-Stars ranked above him; in particular, Sasaki leads the crew's Armored Division. Further, as an ex-pirate captain, Sasaki used to have full command over his own crew at some point. Like the other Tobiroppo, Sasaki is a powerful combatant whose strength makes him potentially worth challenging the All-Stars for their post, something Sasaki seemed confident in his ability to do. He possesses tremendous strength and stamina, which is enhanced by his fish-man heritage. Among the Tobiroppo, he has the third highest bounty at 472,000,000, indicating his threat level. Against Franky, Sasaki was able to hold his own for an extended period of time while his foe piloted his General Franky throughout the fight's duration, keeping his real body secure inside the robot. Though Sasaki was ultimately taken out by two of Franky's strongest attacks back to back, one of which exploited his weak spot as a triceratops, Sasaki was able to force Franky out of the robot with his own final attack, even destroying part of it, despite the mech being tough enough to withstand a point blank missile explosion with no damage. Sasaki's resilience was also commended by Franky, who claimed that Sasaki had survived several finishing moves throughout their fight."},

In fact, he was the only person there who did not fight in the war. He is also prone to complaining, as shown when the Blackbeard Pirates headed to the New World. Despite his complaining and lack of participation, he is shown to be very loyal to Blackbeard. He is shown to be a heavy sleeper as he napped in the daytime during a prison break in Hachinosu.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wolf's abilities have not yet been shown, but he was powerful enough to be contained in Level 6 of Impel Down when caught by the World Government, where even Emporio Ivankov pointed him out as one of the most dangerous prisoners.

After the timeskip, has since become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" that personally guard the Emperor, gaining great authority over their Seventh Ship and everyone on it. As a giant, Wolf ages a lot slower than a human and has immense strength, though he was still defeated by Marine veteran Monkey D. Garp rather quickly. However, this could be becuase he was asleep at the time and was caught off guard. Despite his tremendous size, he is considerably stealthy, able to somehow reach Marineford without being detected until he was right behind the Marine Headquarters building and made himself known.

{"name": "Sakazuki", "episode": "Episode 397", "chapter": "Chapter 278", "year": 2006, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nico Robin in Chapter 319. His real name was revealed in Chapter 397. Formerly known by his admiral alias Akainu.", "appearance": "Sakazuki is an incredibly tall, light-skinned, unusually muscular man (the most muscular of the former admirals and being on par with Sengoku and Garp). He's about as tall as his fellow admirals, with a square-shaped face, very pronounced facial features, and short black hair. He stands at 306cm (10'), making him taller than other massive characters like Jinbe, who is 301cm. He usually wears a standard Marine cap and sports a crimson, double-breasted suit, decorated with what appears to be a pink rose on his left buttonhole. Unlike many high-ranking Marines, he does not wear a tie, but instead leaves his light red colored flower-patterned shirt unbuttoned, showing his muscular neck and part of his tattoo. He wears black gloves and black shoes. The tattoo on the left side of his chest is black (light blue in the anime), containing numerous images of flowers integrated into its design. Sakazuki's tattoo has flame-shaped edges, and it extends from the admiral's left shoulder to his hip, covering part of his back and ribs. He has another, smaller tattoo in the shape of a black sword on his right deltoids and a small part of the biceps. In the anime, his eye color is seen to be brown, and this was also shown in a colored drawing by Eiichiro Oda. In his youth, Sakazuki wore an open red shirt, as well as a set of khaki pants held up with a loosely tied yellow-orange ribbed belt with a silver bullseye shaped buckle, and a pair of red sneakers. He also carried a katana on his back. Twenty-two years ago, at the Ohara Incident, he wore a simple white Marine cap under a dark gray hood that seemed to be a part of a cloak he wore beneath his suit, or Marine coat. Until getting off his chair in order to destroy an incoming iceberg during the Summit War of Marineford, his face was always hidden by the bill of his cap. As a child, Sakazuki still had the grim disposition he retained as an adult. He also wore tattered clothes and carried a dagger. He wore a cap similar to the Marines' cap he would don in the future, except it has the kanji for \"justice\" instead. After the timeskip, as a result of his intense battle with Kuzan at Punk Hazard, the right side of Sakazuki's neck and face are scarred, and a chunk of his right ear is missing. In addition to his injuries, he also grew a mustache and goatee. He has also replaced his trademark red suit for a white one, similar to what Sengoku wore when he was Fleet Admiral; however, Sakazuki still wears the same floral pattern shirt underneath and does not wear his black signature gloves. He continues to wear the standard Marine cap, though unlike his predecessor's, it does not have the life-sized seagull on top. He is also frequently seen smoking a cigar. Later during the Wano Country Arc, he appears to be wearing a darker suit once more, possibly a red one like his pre-timeskip suit.", "personality": "While he is a strong and capable leader who has done well to consolidate the power and prestige of the Marines, Sakazuki would be best categorized as an extremist and highly dogmatic. He is an adamant believer in Absolute Justice and is ruthless in his maintenance of it, his derived motto being \"Thorough Justice\" (, Tetteiteki na Seigi?). He has a stern, dead-serious disposition, is grim, expressionless, and was the most ruthless out of three admirals pre-timeskip. This has given him a very fearsome reputation, but of greater concern is his dogmatism, which may end up making the Marines into a force that is worse than the enemies they hope to eliminate. Despite this disposition, Sakazuki seems to be able to restrain himself at times, having chosen to spare the life of Jewelry Bonney and her crew after they were left beaten and tied by the Blackbeard Pirates for the then-admiral to salvage, and letting his colleague Aokiji leave the Marines after he lost a ten-day duel for the position of fleet admiral. During the Buster Call attack on Ohara, Sakazuki's beliefs led him to go as far as destroying a refugee ship full of innocent people and Marines simply because of the slight possibility that a scholar could be hiding on board, an action that disgusted Vice-Admiral Kuzan (who called him a \"fool\" and an \"idiot\" for overdoing things). Sakazuki's logic was that if even one of the scholars of Ohara had escaped with it, the entire mission would have been a failure. His extremism has given him a borderline, if not outright fanatic demeanor. He is incredibly rigid and absolute in his beliefs, showing little compassion for anyone or anything, and is ruthlessly willing to do whatever it takes to serve his own goals, no matter the cost. He mostly sees the Marines as an extension of himself and his own beliefs, willing to kill those who disagree with him, and showing little if any care for people placed under his charge. While this has made him extremely powerful and feared among pirates, the same fear inspires discontent and loathing by his own men, causing him to lose a very useful and powerful ally in Kuzan because of it. Garp was also enraged that his fanatic obsession for destroying pirates resulted in the death of Ace and the near death of Luffy, though it is unclear if a rift between them has further deepened or caused further dissent among Marines who believe in either's viewpoint. The best example of his absolutism is when he attempted to kill Koby for his plea to stop the war, only to be stopped by the timely arrival of Shanks. His extremism also caused him to bar Admiral Fujitora from ever entering a Marine base due to his prostration in Dressrosa, though it was mostly because Sakazuki could not stand to see his version of justice and honor shamed because his enemies showcased its own failure. Fujitora rightly pointed out that Sakazuki's version of Justice had no credibility or honor in the first place if it was that fragile, which only inflamed Sakazuki's rage further, seeing it as a personal slight. Additionally, he has no tolerance for Marines who desert their posts, to which the only consolation he does offer is that they should not dishonor their families by running away. Caesar Clown also believed that Sakazuki would desire his ideas of mass-murder weapons and inhumane experimentation on prisoners, in contrast to the more pragmatic Sengoku. To Akainu, any Marine who is not willing to fight for justice is not worthy of being called a Marine. Despite all of this, even Sakazuki could not come to kill his former compatriot, Kuzan. As Fleet Admiral, Sakazuki holds immense pride in the name of the Marines. For example, when he learned that Fujitora had let the world know of what transpired in Dressrosa, Sakazuki was furious. His pride is so great he would rather cover up the ordeal to ensure that the Marines are adamant and credible to his doctrine of Absolute Justice. This conceited behavior even led to him yelling at the Five Elders for declaring Doflamingo's resignation from the Warlords of the Sea as a false report, as he knew the world's confusion would damage their trust in the Marines as well as the Marines' reputation. This shows that he does know the value of public trust, but thinks more in terms of the shame losing it brings to the Marines, rather than the morale and good standing of his men. Despite the importance of his position, he found it rather frustrating that it prevented him from entering the battlefield himself. Despite his position as an admiral prior to promotion, Akainu is willing to lie to and deceive his enemies in order to achieve Justice. So far, Akainu's manipulations have been incredibly successful, such as when he managed to deceive Squard through Sengoku's master strategy, or insulting Whitebeard to get Ace angry enough to stop his attempt at escape. He finds people who attempt to interfere with him as nothing more than irritating obstacles. Furthermore, he seems to be unafraid of older legends, as when Whitebeard told his men not to be intimidated by Garp due to the Marine being an old man, Akainu mocked Whitebeard's comment, saying that Whitebeard was also from the same generation as Garp before attacking the Emperor. While other Marines such as Sengoku and Garp share a decent amount of respect for their accomplished enemies, Akainu has no such empathy, instead disparaging them at every chance he gets. Prior to Sengoku making it public, Akainu was one of the few who knew that Luffy was Dragon's son. It is unknown if he has some past relationship with Dragon, or if it was simply common knowledge among the higher-ranking Marines that Dragon is Garp's son. As such, Akainu deems that Luffy's mere existence, due to being Dragon's son, is enough to be a threat to the world and therefore must be eliminated. In fact, Akainu's beliefs about heritage run deep enough that he declares that even if every other pirate escape, he would personally ensure that neither Ace nor Luffy were allowed to leave the war alive due to their bloodlines. This conviction fueled Akainu to the point of actively hunting Luffy himself, even though Blackbeard was destroying Marineford at the time. Sakazuki does not see it as the business of the World Nobles to interfere with the Marines' activities and vice versa. This was proven during his confrontation with the Five Elders, where he disparages them for permitting the Celestial Dragons' CP0 to falsify Donquixote Doflamingo's resignation from the Warlords of the Sea, even questioning whether the Five Elders are the Celestial Dragons' puppets. Surprisingly, Sakazuki can demonstrate sense of caution in regard to battling pirates or causing disturbances in global affairs. This was seen when he did not attempt to attack Shanks when he arrived at Marineford to save Koby. Also, despite Borsalino's request to travel to Wano Country to deal with the possible alliance of the Beasts Pirates and Big Mom Pirates, he declines it citing that Wano's military strength is an unknown factor and they are not within their jurisdiction. However, he considers being Fleet Admiral frustrating when he is forced to wait for the conclusion of the Blackbeard Pirates and Heart Pirates' battle. Akainu also tells his subordinates to not let Rob Lucci fight Luffy until Kizaru arrives at Egghead.", "abilities_and_powers": "As fleet admiral, Sakazuki has total operational command of the Marines, with at present only six direct superiors to answer to: the World Government's Five Elders and Commander-in-Chief. On top of any prior-held authorities as admiral (e.g., issuing special orders like the enactment of a Buster Call on any island he deems a threat, at any time, and granting others such privilege), Sakazuki can now fully lay down the organization's strategy, decide tactics and set policy, discretionally assign and reassign forces to deploy globally in missions (including the admirals), promote or demote the lower ranks, and delegate any such powers as he sees fit; during the two-year timeskip, he exercised his authority to have the Marine Headquarters relocated to the New World as well as institute a global-scale draft. In terms of combat, Sakazuki as the current fleet admiral is among the world's strongest figures, having been held with his fellow admirals as the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\" (i.e., the strongest individual combatants that it can offer, feared by criminals the world over). Sakazuki's background, specifically as a black-hearted extremist, affords him a particularly fearsome repute even by admiral standards, as seen chiefly following the Summit War when Blackbeard, upon learning of Sakazuki's presence aboard a Marine ship meant for negotiations, immediately fled off the island he dwelt on with his crew, noting their unreadiness to face the admiral despite Blackbeard, at that point, having come to wield two of the strongest Devil Fruit powers in existence and bolstered his crew with five of Impel Down's most dangerous and powerful ex-prisoners. During the Summit War, Sakazuki's fighting prowess was well-established against Whitebeard, an Emperor and the world's strongest man, whom the admiral matched up to in a head-to-head confrontation. While Whitebeard managed to gain the upper hand against and delivered a serious blow to Sakazuki in their second clash, the admiral did the same and melted off half of Whitebeard's face in exchange. After being left to fall into a chasm caused by the enraged Emperor's quakes, Sakazuki would soon recover and reenter the battle. Further during the war, Sakazuki proved himself firmly superior to Ace, one of Whitebeard's strongest division commanders despite his young age, effortlessly overpowering Ace in a clash; beforehand, Ace had more or less soundly fended off Aokiji (though in fairness, Sakazuki enjoyed the inherent superiority of his own ability over Ace's, unlike the other admiral). Soon following Whitebeard's rage-fueled onslaught on him, Sakazuki reemerged in what still seemed perfect fighting condition, managing to take down in little time, with utmost ease, a Revolutionary Army commander and deputy commander simultaneously, then another of Whitebeard's commanders. Ultimately, Sakazuki proved to be so unstoppable that not even the likes of Jinbe (a former Warlord of the Sea), both Marco and Vista at once (two of Whitebeard's strongest men), and later (despite Sakazuki's injuries) the collective of most of Whitebeard's commanders (minus Ace and Jozu), alongside some of Whitebeard's subordinate captains and Crocodile (yet another ex-Warlord), could do anything more than slow down the admiral, merely stalling for time in Luffy's escape from him. It took another Emperor, Shanks, to appear and personally stop Sakazuki for him to desist from his pursuit. Ultimately, Sakazuki left the war with no wounds other than those dealt by Whitebeard. Sakazuki would later find his equal in then-fellow admiral Kuzan, their one-on-one duel on Punk Hazard seeing them evenly matched and meeting another blow for blow through most of a ten-day duration; while both men sustained grievous injuries, Sakazuki was the one to prevail and emerge as the victor, with his longtime comrade supposedly left at his mercy."},

However, as the commander of the Happo Army, he is also mindful of and fully dedicated to towards his comrades in arms, and will ruthlessly avenge their defeat. Sai is also compassionate with a very strong sense of honor, even towards his enemies, as when Baby 5 tried to commit suicide (due to his request) he immediately tried to stop her, claiming that was not how he wanted to win. His compassion was shown further when he was enraged at Lao G's insults to Baby 5 and his grandfather. When Pica ruthlessly attacked Baby 5 for treachery, he wasted no time in pushing Baby 5 to safety and taking the full brunt of Pica's attack himself. When Leo tried to save Shirahoshi from Charlos,Sai quickly went to back up the dwarf, showing that he is willing to defy even the World Nobles to help people despite the consequences of doing so. Like many One Piece characters, Sai also has a unique laugh: Kakakaka.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the 13th Commander of the Happo Navy, Sai has authority over all his subordinates and is undoubtfully a powerful fighter. He was able to defeat the Funk Brothers, who are capable of defeating pirates with bounties of over 100 million, with a single kick. He was later able to defeat Lao G, a Donquixote executive who defeated his grandfather easily with a single Haki-embedded kick that shattered the ground around them. Even Chinjao, an ex-pirate with a bounty of over 500 million, acknowledged that Sai had managed to surpass him in strength. After seeing his destructive power even Roronoa Zoro noted his ability and decided to remember his name for the future."},
{"name": "Sabo", "episode": "Episode 583", "chapter": "Chapter 494", "year": 2010, "note": "He was first mentioned by Portgas D. Ace in Chapter 574.", "appearance": "Sabo was a ten-year-old boy at the time of Luffy's flashback, the same age as Ace at that time. He had round eyes, a missing tooth, and short curly blond hair. He wore a large black top hat with a pair of blue goggles wrapped around it, a blue jacket with the sleeves rolled up, a cravat and a pair of light blue cyan shorts held up by a belt with an elaborate flower-design buckle. Before he entered into the Gray Terminal, he was seen with a gentle outfit with a white colored short-sleeved shirt and wearing blue colored shorts as usual. As an adult, Sabo became taller and more muscular. He has matured greatly, with more pronounced facial symmetry and a scar he acquired over his left eye, which was inflicted when Saint Jalmack selfishly blew up the fishing boat Sabo used to set out to sea, leaving him with serious burns and critical injuries. He resembles Luffy enough to allow him to easily deceive opponents as perceptive as Diamante into thinking he was \"Lucy\" by simply wearing the same outfit, although Sabo is still taller than his younger brother. His hair has also grown noticeably longer since his youth, which he styled deliberately to cover up his eye scar. While participating in the final round at the Corrida Colosseum in Luffy's place, he wore Luffy's cape, fake beard, and viking style helmet. In addition, he wore shades to conceal his eyes. He also drew an X-shaped mark on his chest. Later, after the round, he returned to his original outfit, which resembles his old outfit from twelve years ago: a long black jacket with a buckle on the left sleeve, with a blue shirt and vest, a frilled cravat, and a simple belt holding a pair of loosen light-blue pants with black boots (said boots are shown in greater detail in Pirate Warriors 3, to be wrapped with buckles and with cloth bracings). He also wears a pair of brown gloves and the same top hat with goggles over the band.", "personality": "Sabo is devoted to his dreams to the point that he agreed with Ace that the two of them had to kill Luffy so that he could not tell anyone about their treasure, though neither Ace nor Sabo knew how to kill a person nor had any experience, implying some degree of innocence despite their profession. He is very ashamed of being a noble, and even stated that he wished that he had not been born as one. According to Luffy, Sabo is a nicer older brother than Ace. He acknowledged Luffy's powers, and even encouraged his improvement. He helped Ace and Luffy get along when they were fighting, thus being the nice, diplomatic one of the trio. Sabo's dream involves traveling around the world as a pirate. This is in order to write a book containing the story of everything he would see and every place he would visit during his journey. One of the reasons behind all this could be the \"segregation\" that envelopes so much of the Goa Kingdom, a thing that could easily stir a freedom-loving spirit like Sabo's to ask himself what the world was really like outside the walls of High Town, and outside the island itself. However, he was ready to cast aside his dream for the sake of his loved ones. Sabo was loyal to his friends and, in this case his two \"brothers\", to the point that he would give in to the demands of his father, becoming miserable and \"alone\" in order to save both Luffy and Ace. After reawakening his memories, Sabo did not leave the Revolutionary Army to resume his dream as a free-sailing pirate, as he seems to remain convicted to the Army's causes. Despite being the son of a noble, Sabo does not act like a stereotypical noble would act, nor does he consider himself to be a noble. He does not look down on the less fortunate nor does he put on airs about his status. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the citizens of noble birth in Goa Kingdom including his family, who see their status as more important than anything else and will do whatever it takes to raise their social standing or maintain their current status, as well as look down on anyone they consider to be inferior. Sabo rejects these values completely, and even went as far as to say that he feels ashamed of his status as a noble. This can be seen as the reason why he ran away from home and went to live in the Gray Terminal, forfeiting his noble heritage. Since a child becomes a full-fledged noble at the age of eighteen, Sabo intended to leave the Goa Kingdom at the age of seventeen, to escape the idea of being recognized as the thing he hated the most. He even refers to the nobles as \"smelling worse than Trash Mountain, as they are people rotten to the core\". At age 22, Sabo has retained much of his old personality, although he appears to have adapted many mannerisms from Luffy, including his brother's tendency to mispronounce the names of others. Moreover, his tendency to hang up the Den Den Mushi in the middle of a call rather annoys his comrades. He has also displayed an immensely fierce protective streak towards Luffy, to the point where he will disregard everything he is currently doing if he feels that Luffy is in any sort of danger, including his duties in the Revolutionary Army. This is largely contributed by Sabo's inability to save Ace from death before the timeskip, a fact that Sabo still regrets to this very day. This is ironic considering that Ace himself had gained a very similar protective-streak after Sabo's presumed death.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo has command over all lower ranking members, with only one direct superior, Supreme Commander Dragon, to answer to. His bounty of 602,000,000 proves that the World Government views him as an extremely dangerous threat. After the events of the Levely, Sabo is now known as the \"Flame Emperor\", with his reputation having skyrocketed to the point that he is now considered a legend, with his influence said to be even greater than that of his boss Dragon. Even when he had not yet eaten a Devil Fruit, he rose to the position of second-in-command and was able to take on Diamante, a top executive of the Donquixote Pirates, as well as Jesus Burgess, the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates' first ship and one of their strongest members, without any difficulty. After eating the Mera Mera no Mi, his power increased. He took on Admiral Fujitora and came out with only a few bruises, although Sabo suspected the Admiral was holding back. Later, Sabo faced Burgess again and defeated him very easily. According to Ace, who initially planned for Sabo to become his navigator, Sabo also has some experience in navigation."},

He has a curly black mustache and a fluffy gray beard, and wears black shades, which were shattered when Usopp fell on him. Like all other World Nobles, Rosward wears a thick white suit with medal-like knobs and a bubble over his head to prevent himself from breathing the same air as the commoners. His suit included a thick white cape. He also wields a walking cane that is revealed to be a rifle. In Mary Geoise, he is seen carrying a mallet.", "personality": "Rosward is noted to be the most-responsible of his family yet seen; as seen when he scolded his children for their behavior. Though he scolds his children and appears concerned, he is merely maintaining the appearance of their power and acts in a misanthropic, elitist manner almost even more so than his children. Although he has \"never hit his son\", he was livid at Luffy after he assaulted Charlos, for having the gall to directly affront their position. Like his daughter Shalria, he has deep pride in his ancestry. He apparently has a \"Pirate Captain collection\" (which included Devil Dias and Jean Bart), and does nothing to stop or alter the treatment that his children give to others. Rosward has shown to be extremely cruel and brutal as he enjoyed torturingan enslaved Bartholomew Kuma while referring to the latter as a top class slave due to his inability to scream or cry. Like his children, his belief in his untouchable status as a World Noble seems to render him incapable of realizing the danger around him, even when completely obvious. Despite the fact that Luffy brutally punched his son Charlos across the room, Rosward's only reaction is anger, rather than fear of someone who could and would cause him serious harm if provoked, as if he were somehow incapable of being harmed himself. He shot pointlessly at Luffy several times with his cane-rifle until disarmed by Sanji, at which point he apparently realized that the Straw Hats would not be cowed into submission, instead calling for a Marine Admiral to deal with them. Regardless, he still took the threat head-on instead of acting out of cowardly self-preservation, although it's most likely due to his aforementioned belief in his untouchable nature. His pride in the Celestial Dragon heritage is that he despises any of his brethren for not honoring their bloodlines, such as those of the Donquixote Family, specifically Homing and Mjosgard.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a World Noble, Rosward has the authority to act as he pleases without fear of legal repercussion. He also possesses tremendous wealth, having bought a \"Pirate Captain Collection\" of slaves that his daughter can manhandle callously, and his son spending 500,000,000 on a mermaid. He has tremendous political influence, more so than any royalty of the Levely, and the power to summon an Admiral of the Marines in the event he feels his authority alone would not inflict submission. Due to being spoiled by his heritage, Rosward has no fighting skills whatsoever, as he could not hit a stationary Luffy with his firearm even at moderate range, and Sanji easily disarmed him. His endurance and durability was very low, as he was taken out when Usopp fell on top of him."},

His long, darkish hair was an unruly mass, with locks sticking out unevenly behind his head, in every direction. He had slanted eyes and seemingly tended to sport a wide, toothy smile. Rocks' main outfit appeared to have consisted of a high-collared sailor's coat with fringed epaulettes, plus a buttoned shoulder belt.", "personality": "Based on stories of his exploits, Rocks appeared to be an incredibly vicious and ambitious man, having no care as to who he attacked as long as he could garner power for himself and leading his crew to destroy whoever interfered with his ambitions. He was also quite fearless and indiscriminately ruthless, as he had no issue with killing World Nobles or their slaves if it suited his wishes. Rocks' dream was to become the King of the World (, Sekai no ?), and he attacked many locations and left mass destruction in his wake to assert his dominance. He was also very curious about subjects that the World Government had kept hidden, resulting in him dabbling in those subjects.", "abilities_and_powers": "Although Rocks' individual strength and abilities are unknown, he was well-reputed for presiding over a crew of extremely powerful pirates with clashing personalities and a lack of camaraderie, indicating that he was an extremely powerful and charismatic individual. Many of these people would go on to make big names for themselves after the crew's dissolution; \"Whitebeard\" Edward Newgate, \"Big Mom\" Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou \"King of the Beasts\" came to constitute three quarters of the original Four Emperors, widely regarded as the strongest pirate crews in the world during the Golden Age of Piracy. In his time, Xebec was considered to be the most formidable rival of the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, even more so than his then-subordinate Newgate would come to be. He was so fearsome, it took the efforts of both Roger and Monkey D. Garp working together to finally defeat him. Rocks defeat was also what caused Garp to become a legend and to be known as the \"Hero of the Marines\", showing how much of a threat the World Government considered him to be. Kaidou, who by the present has come to be called the \"Strongest Creature\", included Xebec when he listed a very small number of notable figures that were worthy to stand against him in battle, alongside Kozuki Oden, Shanks, Newgate, and Roger, further hinting at Xebec's might and threat. Aside from raw strength, Rocks seemed to be a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, as, through studying many subjects that were considered taboo, he was able to unravel many of the World Government's secrets, which led the Government to decide to erase his name from history following his defeat."},

{"name": "Rob Lucci", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Rob Lucci is a tall and slim, yet muscular man with arched eyebrows and a close-shaved goatee. He has shoulder length wavy black hair that is sometimes tied in a ponytail. When he is not fighting, his pet pigeon Hattori is usually perched quietly on his right shoulder. He has a tattoo of a crossed-out square on each upper arm, as well as five cannonball scars on his back in the shape of the World Government symbol. He was noted to be good looking by some women from Water 7 and Gatherine. He wore a large black top hat with a sepia band until he lost it during his fight with Luffy. As a shipwright, he wore brown trousers with caramel suspenders over a white tank-top and shoes with black toecaps. As an assassin, he wore a two-piece black suit with the sleeves normally rolled up, complete with black leather shoes and a white tie and handkerchief in the breast pocket. When invading Iceburg's mansion he was wearing a bull mask and a light pink robe with thick sleeves and a yellow \"tie\" above. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Lucci is shown with the kanji for \"peace\" (, heiwa?) on his shirt, which possibly suggests that the branch Lucci is holding is an olive branch in tribute to the type of branch held by white doves (in this case Hattori) as a sign of peace. The anime had also portrayed Lucci as a teenager in its rendition of his past story. Though the two portrayals of Lucci are meant to be him, they have different styles to them, mostly because Oda's version was drawn after the anime had already depicted him and not just because they show him at two different ages. Note that Oda did depict the silhouette of thirteen-year-old Lucci from the backside, though only briefly - this most likely is where the anime design for him originates. In CP9's Independent Report, he wore a light spotted shirt with a black coat over his shoulders and had bandages over his forehead and chest from his fight with Luffy and let his hair fall freely. After the timeskip, he wears a blue-white suit with a white coat draped over his shoulders. His beard has also grown longer and has a small ball on the end. As a CP0 agent, he wears a simple mask that covers the top half of his face, with markings that curve beneath the eyes. In One Piece Film: Gold, he wears a little medal on the chest, during the Levely Arc, he wears a purple flower instead. During the Egghead Arc, he wears a medal with a slightly different design.", "personality": "Lucci comes off as a cold, distant, and collected Cipher Pol agent; almost completely sociopathic and amoral of everything around him. A testament to his cold-blooded nature is his brutal assault on his \"friend\" of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9's identities were revealed. He also stated that he felt no true bond with the city of Water 7 which he lived in for five years, and had no concern for his superior Spandam, though he is widely regarded amongst his CP9 colleagues despite his arrogance. During his long undercover period, Lucci remained silent all the time, using Hattori as his preferred method of communication. In spite of his unfriendly looks, shipwright Lucci was polite, humble and tended to call out his fellow shipwrights for questionable conduct, particularly Paulie. Once his mission was completed, Lucci completely abandoned this persona, reverting back to the cold killer attitude that is natural to CP9's agents. Lucci bases his outlook of justice on his personal philosophy that any person or thing that goes against the World Government's interests should be destroyed, but is also evil for being that way. Specifically, he has declared to enforce Absolute Justice in CP9s form of \"Dark Justice\" (, Yami no Seigi?), his motto being \"Necessary Evil\" (, Hitsuy Aku?). As such he is willing go to extreme lengths to fulfill his given mission by any means necessary, believing that CP9's authority to kill to be justified and are unobligated to follow Spandam's ideals as long as they complete their missions efficiently. He also finds it offensive when someone shows weakness around him, as seen when he told the cowardly Marines on a Buster Call ship to shut up, and went as far as to dismiss a new colleague by presumably killing him for being weak. The reason that he killed the five hundred soldiers in his past was due to another belief of his - the belief that weakness is a sin (although he didn't even give them a chance of redemption). Personally, he believes anyone who shows weakness is no better than a criminal. However, it appears that in spite of his stoic and professional appearance, Lucci is far from emotionless or beyond provocation. Beneath his expressionless demeanor, lies tremendous pride and arrogance along with extreme bloodthirst. In the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby, he revealed that he only joined the World Government so he could be legally allowed to kill people; a sentiment which dates back to his childhood. An example of Lucci's lust for violence is when he compromised the mission of bringing Robin to the Gates of Justice, by allowing Monkey D. Luffy to tail him for the sole purpose of having a battle, smirking when Luffy burst through the door. Lucci's violent and cruel nature is also shown when he goes into full-beast mode during battle, in order to attack Luffy more violently. Like his fellow assassin Jabra, Lucci is prone to licking his lips pre-battle, showing a very animalistic side. In and out of combat, Lucci is very sadistic and also seems to derive amusement and gratification from inflicting physical and emotional pain on others. These scenes, along with his anticipation of battle, are the only times where he feels genuinely happy. As an example of his sadism, Lucci once flooded an entire passageway tin an attempt to kill the Straw Hat crew members moving through it, simply because he wanted to eliminate Luffy's chances of having everything, just to anger him. Lucci has a habit of demoralizing and taunting his opponents, which is seen various times during his confrontation with Luffy, where he constantly brought up the possibility of killing Nico Robin. Lastly, while understated initially, it is very clear Lucci's title of the strongest in CP9's history has massively elevated his ego, leading to what appears to be a superiority complex. This pride also means he has a very low tolerance for insults. During his fight with Luffy, Lucci did not pay attention to Usopp until he started insulting him. In addition, he reacts rather violently to anyone calling him a gaki (slang in Japanese for \"kid\" or \"brat\"), responding with a kick and a retort both times after Iceburg and Franky referred to him as such. This is perhaps best exemplified by his reencounter with Luffy at Egghead, where Lucci was eager to fight him again while disregarding Kaku and Stussy's warnings that they needed permission from the World Government to do so due to Luffy's new status. Aside from Lucci's own personal vengeance towards Luffy for defeating him 2 years ago, Lucci cannot accept the fact that a \"mere pirate\" was able to defeat CP9's strongest and ignored all warnings and protocols just so he could battle Luffy one more time. Sometimes, Lucci's pride borders on unfitting childishness as, despite losing once more, he still stubbornly refused to acknowledge Luffy's power or his stature as an Emperor of the Sea despite the latter's victory against Kaidou. Despite all this apparent lack of morality, Lucci has displayed some, if very little, sympathy for those he dubs innocent. When the Candy Pirates were attacking a small village, he quickly dispatched the captain to save the people, though his demonstration of Absolute Justice later prompts him and his comrades to leave. This shows that deep down, he is not completely heartless and is more honorable to the people he respects. Likewise, he shows concern for his pet pigeon Hattori, sending him away when in dangerous situations. Lastly, he expressed gratitude to the doctor who saved his life after his clash with Luffy on Enies Lobby. After the timeskip, Lucci's personality has largely stayed the same, as he condoned Saint Charlos' attempts to claim Shirahoshi as a slave during the Levely. He maintains that the Celestial Dragons are divine and have the right to obtain what they want from normal humans. Still, he is one of the few government agents that is willing to question and delve into the ongoings of the institution, regardless of the dangers of doing so. Lucci also appears to be very honest when he is not under orders to maintain his cover. Even when his enemies had him in cuffs and his only hope of survival was to convince them to release him, he still answered all their questions truthfully without hesitation, even though his answers would have made them want to free him less. That said, this all turned out to be deception from his part, showing that Lucci can be patient and pragmatic in extremely unfavorable situations.", "abilities_and_powers": "As CP9's strongest member, Lucci has had his great power acknowledged even by Bartholomew Kuma of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, who noted that no one could have forseen Lucci's defeat. Even at the tender age of 13, Lucci was already known to be a very capable mass murderer, having killed 500 of a kingdom's soldiers as well as a pirate crew single-handedly. By adulthood, Rob Lucci had become by far the strongest agent in CP9 history, with his Doriki at 4000 (almost twice that of the second strongest agent, Kaku's 2200). Franky remarked that Lucci's strength was levels above the rest of CP9 and that, had it not been for Luffy holding him off with their fight, he was unsure how many of their comrades would have been slaughtered. Since his first known loss to Luffy, Lucci grew more powerful and is now officially part of CP0, which is considered to be the strongest and most exclusive of the Cipher Pols. He also appears to be in a position of authority within CP0, usually giving orders and instruction to other agents. However, he proved to be no match for Luffy after the young pirate become one of the Four Emperors. Because of his reputation, he is a very valuable asset to the World Government, almost to the point of legend. Vice Admiral Onigumo even believed that he could survive a Buster Call attack. Lucci is also a skilled ventriloquist, meaning he is capable of making his voice sound like it is coming from somewhere else, most notably from his pet pigeon Hattori."},
{"name": "Rivers", "episode": "Episode 223", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in the Blue databook.", "appearance": "Rivers is a tall man with a good physique. He wears a white hat with long ear-flaps, a dark-red V-neck shirt with grey trousers and brown boots. When he was younger he wore a white cap very similar to the one he would have as an adult and a blue shirt with green spots and white pants.", "personality": "He feels that Bellamy shouldn't get his hands dirty like people like Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, whom he doesn't consider to be on his level. After Bellamy's defeat, Rivers showed his cowardice, to the point of preventing Sarquiss from facing Luffy and, like the rest, doing nothing when Luffy took all of his captain's gold.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the sniper of the Bellamy pirates, he must be somewhat proficient in using a gun, or another projectile weapon."},
{"name": "Roronoa Zoro", "episode": "Episode 3", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "He was first mentioned by Alvida in Chapter 2.", "appearance": "Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent. Zoro's body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive scar stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired during his loss against the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr. 3's Tokudai Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through unknown means. Zoro's other remarkable feature is his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases him about by calling him \"marimo\" (moss-ball, moss-head in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations) due to its resemblance to one.", "personality": "Zoro usually maintains a very stern, serious, and distanced personality, but often loses his temper in a goofy and exaggerated comical style. It would seem however, that this anger is the only emotion that Zoro often feels comfortable showing. Outside of situations where he feels confident in battle, he tends to smile or laugh the least out of the Straw Hats and rarely fools around with the rest of the crew and likes to distance himself more to sleep or train. In fact, his defeat at the hands of Dracule Mihawk and subsequent vow to Monkey D. Luffy is the only time since his friend Shimotsuki Kuina passed that Zoro has been seen crying in the series. Even in moments that are particularly tough on the crew and would warrant sadness, Zoro chooses to maintain a quiet solemnity rather than outwardly express his emotions. He has been shown to believe to a degree that these emotions can hinder his judgement as a swordsman: when Ohm asked him if he was out for revenge upon discovering Tony Tony Chopper wounded and unconscious, he replied that he does not like to fight for reasons like that. Despite this assertion, though, he cares deeply for his crewmates and wishes to protect them at all costs, telling Ohm that in spite of his preference for fighting without a motivation he can feel one coming on. Although Zoro cares for his crew, he can also come off as a very blunt and cold person, especially when he is trying to get his point across. During the Davy Back Fight, when Chopper was forced to join Foxy's crew after losing an event, Chopper cried and complained, which prompted Zoro to yell at him and stating he was disgraceful. He reprimanded Chopper, reminding it was his choice to join the Straw Hats and compete in the fight and told him to man up and have faith in the crew to win him back. As with the ordeal when Usopp left the crew, Zoro refused to let him come back and even yelled at Nami to shut up when she tried to say otherwise. Zoro lectured the entire crew reminding them Usopp was the one who picked the fight with Luffy and left of his own free will and they cannot let him come back unless he accepts responsibility for his actions and apologizes for his behavior. Zoro also often reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right in the end. This is especially true in regards to strangers, as Zoro rarely shows much trust in others. This was made apparent when Nico Robin joined, and he was the only one to keep his guard up around her due to her being a former enemy. However, over time, he seems to have learned to place his trust in others more, as he agreed with the alliance with Law and believed Hiyori when she revealed her identity to him. Zoro is also very perceptive, something he demonstrates by providing important and logical decisions at critical times and by evaluating the situation from an objective point of view, as he did in Water 7 by evaluating the best way to handle what seemed like Robin's betrayal. And later again when the crew wanted to bring Usopp back after he challenged Luffy to a duel over the Going Merry and lost, saying that they shouldn't pity Usopp. Zoro was the one who noted that Usopp was at fault for leaving the crew of his own accord. Like Nico Robin, Zoro is also easily really sensitive when put into embarrassing situations to where he prefers to object vocally while usually blushing from embarrassment (though Robin usually ignores and lets go of these situations most of the time because of her patience), rather than respond violently like Nami or Sanji. Examples are during the Thriller Bark Arc, Zoro refused to do something stupid like address Franky as \"Bro\", or Franky's later joke technique \"Pirates Docking 6: \"Big Emperor\" where after they disassembled, Zoro felt stupid for agreeing to do it in the first place. In the Dressrosa Arc, Zoro was embarrassed when he had Wicca with him when traveling through town, as trying to communicate with her made the people around them think Zoro was \"talking to himself\" since they couldn't see Wicca due to her small size (though it was revealed at the end of that arc that Dressrosa's citizens were secretly aware of the dwarves' existence). Also, during anime-only events in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, when Zoro was forced to help take care of children, he intended to make sure that the crew or any of the town's residents that knew him personally did not find out about this embarrassing situation, though later was found out by Robin. Zoro does have rare moments of responding violently in these situations, such as choking Chopper during Aqua Laguna for mentioning to Luffy and Nami the embarrassing story of how Zoro got stuck in the chimney of a house which Luffy laughed about (though Luffy was also in a similar situation earlier). He also seems to be partially irreverent, but not seriously so, simply choosing to focus more on his training and what is clearly in front of him than worry about spiritual matters as well as questions about its mysteries that he cannot truly answer. While he is quite indifferent to the gender or/and age of his opponents, many of his adversaries (like Tashigi and Monet) seem to believe he does not take women seriously when in fact it is only because Tashigi reminded him too much of Kuina and that Monet was merely a distraction. When the latter tried to take advantage of this belief, he cut her down without hesitation, only refraining from killing her because she was too weak to even be considered a proper opponent, using a non-Haki strike in lieu of a blunt attack. During his fight with Miss Monday, Zoro did not hesitate to crush her skull with his bare hands to knock her out. It should be noted that he does disagree to a certain extent about using excessive force against women. For example, when Nico Robin was violently electrocuted by Enel, Zoro was extremely ferocious at him, reminding the Birkan that his target is a woman. Like Luffy, Zoro shows little interest or attraction to women. He was not enticed or won over by the beauty or charms of Nami or Robin when they joined, did not peep on the women's bath when Nami and Vivi were bathing, nor does he show interest in overwhelming beauties such as the Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi or Boa Hancock. Zoro seems to rather focus on whatever task is at hand and his own training. Despite this, Zoro has acted flustered around some women, though not in romantic ways. During his childhood, Zoro was seen blushing when Kuina mentioned her figure was beginning to develop. When he first met Tashigi, he was visibly shocked by her strong resemblance to Kuina and whenever he encountered her, he would constantly try to run away unable to face her. This is no longer the case after the timeskip, as he lost his uncomfortable behavior around her and treated her coldly during their fight with Monet and was more irritated when she complained about him carrying her after she passed out. During his interactions with Kozuki Hiyori, Zoro was very startled to wake up seeing her sleeping on top of his chest and tried to explain to Brook that nothing happened, and more so when she playfully asked if he enjoyed it. Though he rarely uses it, Zoro knows various phases of the traditional warrior's battle cry of \"Sunacchi\"; something that he recounts hearing and learning from Shimotsuki Kozaburo in Shimotsuki Village. He's never used it personally however but has told Momonosuke about it to energize the latter in his sword training, saying that it would strengthen his heart when his courage falters.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zoro has devoted his life to becoming the world's strongest swordsman. Even before joining the crew, he was well-renowned for his outstanding abilities and accomplishments in battle. His skills drastically improved after becoming the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates and entering a two-year training period under the \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\", Dracule Mihawk. By the time he met Luffy, Zoro had established himself as a fearsome bounty hunter in the East Blue, so much so that Koby had heard he was a \"demon in the form of a man\". His accomplishments in hunting pirates were significant enough to earn him the epithet of \"Pirate Hunter\", which he remains known for even after becoming a pirate. After his crushing loss to Dracule Mihawk, he vowed never to lose again. Since joining the crew, Zoro has defeated several mighty adversaries (most of whom are fellow swordsmen). Alongside Luffy and Sanji, Zoro is considered one of the Monster Trio (, Kaibutsu San-ningumi?) of the Straw Hats due to his strength. In some instances, he has even been mistaken as the leader of the Straw Hats due to his more extensive reputation; onlookers have also wondered how he could not be the captain after seeing demonstrations of his power. During the crew's journey, Zoro has come to possess some of the most legendary swords in history and has used them to both improve his skills and develop the most devastating attacks. Zoro was the second Straw Hat to receive a bounty, and for much of the crew's existence, his bounty has been the second highest. Zoro was identified as a Super Rookie after obtaining a bounty of over 100,000,000 before reaching the Sabaody Archipelago; he was only one of two non-pirate captains (alongside Killer) of the \"Worst Generation\" to have that distinction. Weaker people are easily intimidated by Zoro, as Koby remarked that he had a \"demonic aura\" at Shells Town even as he was tied up and starved of food for over a week. This ability has held even in the New World, as when Monet came to suddenly realize the degree of power and killing intent Zoro had, she froze in place as Zoro charged her. After Zoro intentionally performed a harmless attack, she then became seized by fear to such a degree that she was unable to reform her Logia body to its normal state. When Zoro gets serious in a battle, he usually dons his black bandanna on his head. Ever since entering the New World, he has rarely been wounded or given a serious challenge, defeating Monet with his sheer strength alone without Haki, frightening her to the point of being unable to control her elemental form. His first genuine challenge was a short confrontation with one of the Admirals, Fujitora, who described his slash attack as ferocious despite being held down by gravitational force. As the first showcase of his greatly improved strength and skills, Zoro defeated Pica, one of the Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo's top three elite officers, in a couple of moves after slicing apart his colossal stone body and figuring out the nature of his Devil Fruit abilities. Zoro suffered his first serious wound in Wano against Kamazo the Manslayer, albeit because he avoided a surprise assault from Gyukimaru, while still managing to defeat the assassin using a single attack (without Shusui at the time). During the Raid on Onigashima, he faced off against the Emperor Kaidou, famed as the world's strongest Creature, in both his Beast and Human-Beast Forms; wounding him despite the tremendous toughness of his body, then giving him his second scar since Kozuki Oden, earning his acknowledgment. In his battle against King, Kaidou's right-hand man and the Beasts Pirates' head All-Star, Zoro was able to apply advanced Haoshoku Haki and Busoshoku Haki to his three swords, defeating the Lunarian in top condition, despite grievous wounds. Due to these events, his bounty was raised to 1,111,000,000; the second highest among the Straw Hat Pirates, ranking just below his captain, Monkey D. Luffy, who was recognized as an Emperor."},

In his disguise as Ricky, he wears a dark purple (blue in the anime) cape with a skull and crossbones on the back, a black pair of briefs covered by a leather pteruges skirt, a leather chest harness, and a gold (silver in the anime) masked helmet which covers his entire face save for his eyes and features a prominent nose-guard; it also features a flame-like design on it. A crack in this helmet received during his fights in the B Block battle royale revealed that he has a thick brown mustache and beard. Doldo later revealed his identity in the dungeon beneath the Colosseum and is shown to have a beard, mustache and thick eyebrows. A spiky ring of hair goes around the back of his head and he has a single large tuft of hair near his crown. A stitched scar runs from right above his left eyebrow to the top of his head. It was the result of a head injury he received when he first met Kyros.At some point, he received a second scar across the right side of his upper chest and lower neck. While he was king of Dressrosa, he had all his hair, which was still dark colored around the temples. His facial hair and eyebrows also shared the same color. Riku's attire was, at that point, usually covered by a royal mantle.", "personality": "Although the modern public used to revile his name, Doldo, in truth, is an extremely kind, noble, and caring man. When he was king, he cared immensely for his people, as he put the welfare of Dressrosa's citizens first and readily helped countries that were in need. This earned him great respect from monarchs of other countries such as Elizabello II. Upholding the Riku family ancestors' ideas of compassion and pacifism, he desires peace, as he agreed to pay Doflamingo's ransom instead of declaring war against him. He even went as far as bowing down to the citizens, despite his advisers saying it would shame him, showing that he was willing to go beyond a royalty's ethics. However, he recognized that his pacifist ways caused him to be a weak ruler as it consequently resulted in the immense suffering of countless Dressrosa citizens and the death of his own daughter Scarlett. Thus, Doldo had no intentions of ever returning to the throne. After Doflamingo's downfall, however, the people of Dressrosa unanimously elected him to be their king again, wanting peace above all else. Doldo is also a very proud man.

As a gladiator, she wore a yellow scale armor bikini, with a turquoise paludamentum, as well as a ridge helmet, a pair of greaves and gloves, ahigh-heeled armor, and a necklace. The helmet got damaged during Hakuba's assault and was missing the visor's middle piece in the second round. It was completely shattered after Diamante bashed her over the head with a club. She carried a large sword and shield. She discarded the shield before entering the D Block battle royale. She is considered extremely attractive and beautifulby the other gladiators. When a fan asked whether Rebecca wears underwear underneath her gladiator loincloth, Oda answered that he had an idea, but refused to give an actual answer. Underneath her helmet, her braid splits off into two strands starting at her temples. Before the Corrida Colosseum tournament started, she wore a short and simple white dress, a yellow pearl necklace and brown sandals. After Donquixote Doflamingo was defeated and she briefly regained her status as a princess, she was seen wearing a light-colored dress with frills at the bottom, almost identical to the one her mother wore.

She has dark green eyes, and her lips are apparently covered with pink lipstick. Like all Shandia, she has two small wings on her back. Raki's outfit consists of a light purple cleavage revealing tunic with a darker pattern that exposes her stomach, and light-red pants, reminiscent of the ones worn by Native Americans, that are open on the inside of her legs. She also has matching colored Skate-type Wavers she wears into battle. After the end of the Skypiea Arc, she wears a more casual version of her outfit. Since her childhood, Raki, like many Shandia, has usually stayed barefoot instead of wearing shoes; however, Raki does use them sometimes, such as having on a pair of black flats six years prior to her first appearance. Following the events of the Skypiea Arc, Raki starts wearing shoes on a common basis, using a pair with the outfit she had on at the end of the Skypiea Arc when on a walk with her close friends. After two years, she has two pieces of hair tied on the top of her head instead of one. She also wears the same sleeveless shirt as Conis with a face with wings on it.", "personality": "Raki is a brave, kind-hearted Shandia woman who likes to make others happy. According to Wyper however, she worries over small things (such as Aisa's bag of Vearth) when she should be focused on the bigger goals (such as winning back their homeland so they never have to fight for just one bag of Vearth ever again).", "abilities_and_powers": "She uses a rifle as her weapon of choice, and she was seen carrying a small shield on her left arm. Like the other Shandia, she can use Jet Skis quite proficiently for in-air transportation. Raki is also quite resistant, as she took a mighty electricity-based attack from Enel and was still able to stand up later."},
{"name": "Raizo", "episode": "Episode 817", "chapter": "Chapter 768", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was first mentioned by Kanjuro in Chapter 803.", "appearance": "Raizo is a very large man, standing at 311cm (10ft). He is also quite disproportionately wide, with his head being nearly the same width as the rest of his body. He has exceptionally pronounced cheekbones and a long, square jaw with rounded teeth. He also has thick and lightning-shaped black eyebrows as well as a crescent moon-shaped scar on his forehead that was given to him by King. He has been noted to look rather older and ugly, with no woman being attracted to him, and the prisoners in Udon were not sure he had time traveled as they could easily believe he had aged 20 years since the last time they saw him. Raizo possesses short black hair that includes a small spike at the top of his head; the hair is also partitioned into six tendrils on the sides shaped like antennae. He bears the Kozuki Family crest somewhere on his body. For clothing, Raizo wears a light blue kimono whose inner edges are lined by orange stripes dotted with dark blue polka dots. He also wears a green obi tied in a bowtie around his waist, a dark yellow-scaled undershirt and pants under his kimono, a purple nio-dasuki on his back, and a pair of sandals on his feet. He also wears two diamond-shaped appendages on his back whose colors alternate between light and dark blue; this apparatus appears to function as a kite. In the past one to two decades of his life, Raizo was much smaller and his six hair appendages were shorter and shaped more like spikes.", "personality": "Raizo is a serious, honorable, and kindhearted man who cares greatly about his comrades and the people he serves. He will work tirelessly to aid his group's objectives and has no issue with risking his life; on the flip side, he absolutely hates the idea of people risking their lives to protect him. This was shown on Zou when he was devastated to see the Mokomo Dukedom residents injured protecting him from Jack, and said he would rather they turn him in rather than continue facing danger. Raizo has a tendency to become very emotional when overcome by strong feelings, both good and bad, and will often bawl heavily. He will not hesitate to show people just how much he cares about or is grateful for them. Raizo cares greatly about the samurai code of loyalty, and although he detests Kurozumi Orochi, he did commend his rival ninja Fukurokuju for remaining loyal to the shogun. Raizo has demonstrated himself to be quite diligent and prepared, a necessity for his profession. During the preparation period for the assault on Onigashima, Raizo was effective in formulating and executing strategies to increase the alliance's numbers, and also kept tabs on potential unresolved issues such as a lack of weapons to arm their allies with. He is not rash and will wait for the most opportune time to execute his plans, even if it takes several days. The only time Raizo was shown lapsing in his attentiveness while infiltrating enemy territory was when he reunited with his old comrade Kawamatsu in the Prisoner Mine, which resulted in him being spotted by the Beasts Pirates when the cart he was hiding behind moved. Even in emotional moments Raizo does not lapse in his judgement, as when Oden seemingly appeared before them in the present day, Raizo was one of the few Scabbards to doubt it was actually him, using logic to explain his doubt even though he wished that Oden was indeed still alive. Raizo takes his profession seriously and does not like to showcase his skills just for performance. However, he eventually relented with the Straw Hat Pirates when he saw them sullen after his refusal. Despite claiming to not partake in such an activity, Raizo has been shown adopting the stereotypical ninja verbal tic \"nin-nin\" when caught up in thrilling action during ninja duties. He has also been shown referring to simple actions like hugs as ninjutsu techniques. Raizo wishes to have a romantic relationship with a kunoichi, and his inability to attract women is something he is very self-conscious and depressed about. When he was younger, a rejection by a kunoichi drove him to leave the service of the Kozuki Oniwabanshu and live in despair as a vagabond in Udon for some time. Over a decade later, he was shown bemoaning his master Oden finding a wife while he had no such luck.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his massive size, Raizo is capable of carrying normal-sized humans on his head and shoulders with no issue. Despite his size, he is extremely fast, being capable of leaping off the walls of the Executive Tower in Udon too rapidly for any of the guards to keep up with. Additionally, he is fast enough to be able to hide with only the assistance of a smoke ball, even in large, crowded spaces. He has enough endurance to after recovering in a short time from battling Kaidou, Raizo was able to function normally. He also outlast Fukurokuju when they were both on fire despite being lit up first."},

Due to him eating a SMILE, he grew a rabbit face on his chin, with the rabbit's head doubling as his beard, rabbit ears framing his face from both sides, and a large rabbit tail on his back. His hair is shaped like horns worn by most Gifters. He wears a light green shirt, green pants, a brown and orange vest, and brown boots.", "personality": "Rabbitman is very loyal to his crew. He is also dedicated to maintaining the social order of Wano, as he tried to prevent the residents of Okobore Town from eating clean food.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about Rabbitman's abilities, but he has enough authority in Kuri to demand the retrieval of the food supply from Okobore Town."},
{"name": "Raideen", "episode": "Episode 866", "chapter": "Chapter 836", "year": 2017, "note": "", "appearance": "Raideen was a giant with light hair which stuck out from the sides of his helmet, which was a warrior's helmet with eyepieces which obscured his eyes. He wore a striped button-down shirt with much of the top unbuttoned, as well as a dark coat lined with light fur.", "personality": "Raideen cares greatly about maintaining Elbaf's warrior roots, aspiring to train his students for greatness. His passion for Hajrudin's training earned him praise from the heroes of the giants, Jorul and Jarul.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a giant, Raideen likely possessed a tremendous amount of physical strength. He possesses at least decent skill in combat, as he trained Hajrudin in it and was shown overpowering him in a duel, although Hajrudin was a young child at the time."},

When Kid managed to significantly injure Big Mom with Punk Corna Dio, Quincy cheered him on."},
{"name": "Queen", "episode": "Episode 925", "chapter": "Chapter 918", "year": 2018, "note": "He first appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 920.", "appearance": "Queen is a massive, round-figured man (evidently obese but claiming otherwise) with light skin. At a towering 612cm tall, he is a mere centimeter shorter than his fellow All-Star King. Similar to Jack, Queen is built top-heavy, with thick, tapering arms yet, compared to his upper self, smallish legs. After being drained of his fluids by Ryokugyu, he became much skinnier. His head is hunched, undistinguished from his neck due to its plumpness, with a small face. His eyes are hidden by sunglasses with blue lenses and gray, oval rims, which instead of having temples are strapped on by black tapes that go around his head in such a way as to form an X both on his forehead and occiput. Queen has no visible eyebrows, a small hook nose, and his small mouth, sporting navy lipstick, always smokes a big cigar. His hair is blond: a thick, queue-like braid through eight ties, with a stinger-shaped ending tuft, comes out the back of his head, which is otherwise bald. Additionally, he dons a Fu Manchu mustache whose tendrils widen as they droop to his chest. A stitched scar runs curvilinear from his right chest up to the shoulder. On Queen's upper right arm is a black (dark blue in the anime) tattoo consisting of his crew's Jolly Roger above his name in block capitals. Queen's left arm, up to the shoulder, is cybernetic in gray and golden color, composed of metallic rings, bolted plating, wiring, and even a small pressure gauge, with the corresponding hand covered in an orange glove, but was later destroyed by Sanji during the Raid on Onigashima. Queen wears large, very high-waisted overalls that uniformly reach just below the chest, are thickly, vertically striped black-and-white, and held up by suspenders connecting with 8-shaped, golden clasps on the frontal top edge; a piece of cloth striped the same is integrated into his metal arm. As for footwear, Queen has simple, brown ankle boots. As a child, he was chubby and shaved his hair to a buzzcut. He wore dark overalls and a pair of goggles on his forehead. During his time in MADS over 20 years ago, he was thin and had no facial hair. His hair was seemingly dyed, and styled in a mohawk-like hairstyle. He had sunglasses and multi-part earrings. He wore a light short-sleeved shirt which he kept open, trousers with vertical stripes, a belt, and dark gloves. Over time, he put on more and more weight, grew out his moustache, started braiding his hair into a queue, and mechanized his left arm. 20 years ago, he had a shorter, pencil-style mustache.", "personality": "Living up to his position as an All-Star, Queen prides himself as being a lively entertainer amongst the crew, including performing his signature funky songs and dances to rally his subordinates. Being extremely dramatic, he tends to treat his position as his own personal show, as seen when he told Babanuki to make an official ranking of the current issues at Udon. He can also be rather vain while performing, as he proudly proclaimed his fat as mere muscle and how he would be much more attractive if he was not voluntarily this large. At the time of being assaulted by Ryokugyu, he protested the loss of his corporal volume. Queen is also extremely arrogant with immense pride in himself and his crew as he considered the Beasts Pirates to be the strongest and the Pleasure and Waiter members of his crew to be useless dead weight due to their lack of artificial Zoan Devil Fruit powers making them incapable of being actual use to the crew itself. He also despises people who criticizes him and his actions such as his fellow All Star King due to his ego as an All Star of the Beasts Pirates, as he took twisted pride in using his viruses to hurt people including his own subordinates. Queen also considered Chopper's actions of saving infected members of the Beasts Pirates to be unnecessary, and even tried to kill Chopper out of annoyance for lecturing him with his medical ethics. Queen is extremely sadistic with an obsessive penchant for blood sports and execution games as a form of entertainment for himself and his crew, believing that the time it takes for a battle to conclude combined with the number of fighters is what determines the level of excitement in combat. To this end, Queen is fair to some extent, allowing Luffy to fight in the Great Sumo Inferno without being restricted by the Seastone cuffs. However, his execution games are nevertheless intended to be inescapable and unwinnable. He is also willing to add sadistic rules such as keeping Kid and Kamazo submerged in water until Luffy and Hyogoro die in the ring. He also has no qualms toying with the lives of his subordinates such as the Pleasures and Waiters for his own enjoyment. Despite having an inflated ego, Queen has a habit of losing his composure in light of an urgent situation. This was seen on Onigashima, when the Nine Red Scabbards suddenly showed up on the Live Stage to attack Kaidou, with a shocked Queen wondering where they came from. He is also shown not to be fearless as he was terrified upon seeing the change in Big Mom once she regained her memory. After Big Mom abruptly fell asleep, Queen took extreme precautions to restrain the sleeping Emperor and escort her to Onigashima as quickly as possible. However, this caused him to overlook the fact that Luffy was free of his collar and of the threat he now represented to Udon. His cowardice is evident during Kaidou's brawl with Big Mom, when Queen told his subordinates not to cower only for them to accuse him of making excuses to leave Onigashima. Like King, Queen is extremely rude and critical of his crewmates, as he was quick to deride his fellow All-Stars and call them names. He and King seem to have a mutual sense of disdain for Jack, as they are quick to gang up on him when in the same room. He also used derogatory language when addressing his subordinates in Prisoner Mine. According to Daifugo, Queen's hobbies are building weapons and viruses. As a scientist, Queen is extremely proud of his scientific talents, as he flaunts his personal cybernetic modifications, which he claims to be superior to Vegapunk's, in battle. He also enjoys proving his scientific superiority, as he demanded that Sanji use his Raid Suit against him to allow him to compete his own technology against Germa's. Queen also has a fondness for beautiful women, as he was seen ogling a picture of Komurasaki, and he appears to frequent the Red-Light District for prostitutes. His subordinates believed that he would go berserk and take his anger out on them if he found out that Komurasaki was dead. Queen is a glutton who is extremely fond of oshiruko, claiming it is just as important to him as the air he breathes. He is adamant in his refusal to share with anyone. When Queen does not get his daily fill of oshiruko, he becomes easily irritable and even murderous. Queen's love for oshiruko is so immense, that he is willing to fight the Emperor Big Mom to prevent her from stealing his oshiruko. Queen has interjected the word \"Excite\" (, Ekisaito?) into his sentences. The Japanese word for his epithet, \"Plague\", is \"Ekisai\" (?). The Viz translation retains the pun, with Queen saying phrases like \"I'm plagued with excitement!\". Like many other characters, Queen has his own distinct laugh, \"Muhahaha\" (, Muhahaha?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates, Queen has great authority over his crew just below his Governor-General. He formerly had the highest authority over Udon, a region in Wano Country, and oversaw proceedings at the Prisoner Mine, where all the Shinuchi who maintained the facility reported directly to him. In terms of battle prowess, Queen is one of the Beasts Pirates' strongest warriors, implied to be the strongest after Kaidou and King, holding a bounty of 1,320,000,000 that illustrates his fearsome reputation. Queen is a veteran pirate, having been part of the Beasts Pirates for at least 20 years and was already considered among its strongest members even then. Like the other All-Stars, he is hailed as a \"calamity\" for his destructiveness, having earned the moniker of \"The Plague\" due to his use of extremely potent manufactured viruses. In fact, had it not been for the efforts of Tony Tony Chopper, the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates, the thousands of warriors fighting on the Live Floor of the Skull Dome would have all been wiped out after being infected by just one of his artificial viruses. In the midst of combat, Queen exhibits extraordinary fighting skills, as he (alongside King), was able to battle Marco the Phoenix, the former right hand of the Emperor Whitebeard, until the latter's exhaustion, and emerged from the fight with superficial injuries, before engaging a large group of enemies. As a further testament to his power, Chopper, in his strongest form, the Monster Point, was utterly helpless before Queen, being quickly overwhelmed when the All-Star decided to take the fight seriously, and being unable to inflict any substantial damage on him during a time span of at least twenty minutes."},

His arms, hands, and legs were composed of bendable metal rods.", "personality": "Being Vegapunk's \"wisdom\" satellite, Pythagoras has shown to be calm and highly interested in observing the performances of Vegapunk's inventions. It is devoted to recording data from these tests and examining the potential scientific implications, and can grow very excited when situations arise that provide exceptional data. It also tends to resort to peaceful solutions, as it was trying to reason with the CP0 agents that were sent to kill Vegapunk and his satellites, trying to create excuses for them not to land on Egghead. It even advised Lilith not to make things worse when she got angry at their repeated requests for permission to dock, knowing impulsive reactions could lead to them just coming to the island anyway.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a satellite of Vegapunk, Pythagoras has been a contributor to the genius scientist's numerous technological developments. Pythagoras is extremely intelligent, being capable of drawing a large number of theories and conclusions just by witnessing Vegapunk's inventions in action; when observing one of the Seraphim in combat, Pythagoras quickly made observations regarding potential Lineage Factor traits.

Unfortunately for him and his men, however, the commodore underestimated the pirate's abilities, possibly out of overconfidence in the Marines. He was shown to practice a somewhat refined version of justice, caring for not only the evacuation of the survivors from Arlong's reign, but also destroying the Arlong pirates altogether for their crimes. Unlike Nezumi, he appeared not in the least bit willing to negotiate with Arlong.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a commodore of the 77th branch, Pudding Pudding had command over the base and lower ranking Marines.

While sleeping, Prometheus does not exude any sun rays nor light, instead appearing a mere orb with a face floating in midair. When he was initially described by Pound, he had a fierier appearance and was surrounded by fireballs rather than sunrays. His facial features consisted of only slanted, pupilless eyes and a mouth. He took this appearance when joining with Big Mom to attack the Thousand Sunny. Prometheus is very similar in appearance to his predecessor created by Carmel, Pandora, down to having a second more fireball-like appearance - though Prometheus lacks eyelashes, has a smaller face compared to his body, and tends to have forehead lines when smiling.", "personality": "Prometheus is very loyal to Big Mom and will come to her when she summons him. He also cares about the safety of the citizens in Totto Land and may even question Big Mom and beg her to cease if he sees her tantrums are causing harm to others. However, due to being a homie, he can never physically go against Big Mom due to fearing her powerful soul as all homies do. Loyal to Big Mom, Prometheus would not hesitate to execute any traitors in cold blood, as he brutally incinerated Kingbaum while callously causing heavy casualties among other homies nearby. Prometheus has little faith in his fellow special homie Zeus, and repeatedly called him back and then scolded him when Zeus was lured into abandoning Big Mom to eat Nami's clouds. Prometheus seems to overall think lowly of Zeus, considering him a useless deadweight that only serves to drag Big Mom down, and eventually convinced her to replace him with a new thundercloud homie, Hera, whom Prometheus wanted as a girlfriend, but to his chagrin, she rejected him. Prometheus showed no regret at Zeus being disposed of by Linlin and Hera. Prior to fighting Brook, Prometheus had never been injured. Thus, when receiving a wound, he became very shocked and distressed at the pain.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prometheus is far more powerful than normal homies, being made from a fragment of Big Mom's very own soul. This gives the sun a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the Yomi Yomi no Mi's user. However, Prometheus is still vulnerable to being injured by the user of the fruit. Being made of fire, he is immune to almost all physical attacks, even ones imbued with Busoshoku Haki (since he has no substantial body beneath his intangible effect), but can be harmed by water. However, due to his size, it will take a large quantity of water to just slow him down. Prometheus can also be cut by the fire-cutting blade ability of Foxfire Style, and he expressed pain from the attack. As a sun, Prometheus can fly, and is able to produce incredibly powerful flames and explosions, strong enough to harm Vinsmoke Reiju while she was wearing a flame-resistant Raid Suit. When combining powers with Zeus, they can create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms. Prometheus can also attack by growing in size to gigantic proportions, dwarfing even the enormous Kingbaum, and falling down on his opponents, burning everything in a large radius around him to cinders. However, while Prometheus is in his gigantic size, he moves more sluggishly. Though very powerful, Prometheus's flames can be overpowered by those generated by the user of the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix, due to their special properties. He has the ability to sense Napoleon's whereabouts. Prometheus can also serve as Big Mom's mode of transportation, if Zeus is not available, and can become a part of Big Mom's hair, where he has the ability to burn anything he comes into contact with. Big Mom can also use Prometheus's flames to set Napoleon's blade alight in order to increase his attack power. Similar to Zeus' lightning-eating habits, Prometheus needs to eat fire to regain his strength."},

He wears a fur coat, an open shirt revealing his torso, a pair of dark pants and a Marine cap with an oversized bill. He also wears rings on each of the four fingers on his right hand. During his debut in the cover story, he wore his fur coat draped over his shoulders. In subsequent appearances in the Egghead Arc, he wears it normally with his arms through the sleeves.", "personality": "Grus is a patient, reasonable individual who obeys the usual Marine protocols and avoids unnecessary recklessness, regardless if others attempt to pressure him into action.

{"name": "Pound", "episode": "Episode 831", "chapter": "Chapter 792", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 835.", "appearance": "Pound is a very big man, with his head alone being twice the height of Carrot and significantly wider. He is shown to be much bigger and taller than even Oven who is 492cm tall. However, his head is the same size as the rest of his body, making him appear to be a giant when only his head is in view, and his legs are extremely disproportionately short. He has long, wavy light pink hair tied into a ponytail on top, a long and thin mustache, and a stubbly beard. His face is shaped like a pear, and he has rather small eyes which contrast with his very large nose and mouth. He wears a frilly light blue suit and dark pants that are tattered due to him being buried, and only has a shoe on his right foot. 26 years ago, Pound still had a stubble on his lip and wore a crown, an accessory that Big Mom's husbands are allowed to wear until she discards them.", "personality": "Pound has various quirks that can seem very weird to those who meet him, as he buried himself in the ground because he likes it and frequently talks about his craving for apple juice. He maintains a neutral attitude around those he meets and will often speak to them normally despite whatever is happening to them, not seeming to pay any mind to outside conflicts due to not wanting to get involved in them, though he can sometimes place his conviction in people he takes a liking to. He has a habit of speaking his mind, which can annoy those around him. He can be caring and brave. At the Seducing Woods, he attacked Brle when rescuing Nami. Unlike Linlin, he truly loves his daughters and did not hesitate to charge at Oven when he was threatening Chiffon. According to Big Mom, he was extremely stubborn and persistent in seeing his daughters no matter how many times he had been kicked out by Linlin and that conviction was enough for Chiffon and Lola to finally believe him to be their father. Content with having the chance to see Chiffon, Pound faced the prospect of death with a smile on his face. He cried with happiness at the sight of his grandson waving at him and seeing his daughter happy and safe.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pound has no fighting skills, however, his size alone is enough to intimidate others. Despite not being a fighter, Pound has shown a certain degree of durability, as he took a beating from someone as powerful as Oven and remained conscious. He was briefly unable to move due to his injuries, but recovered quickly enough to thwart Oven's attempt to prevent the Nostra Castello's escape from Cacao Island. Due to his large size, Pound has sufficient strength to use a large club to send two members of the Big Mom Pirates flying and enough leg strength to jump a far distance towards Oven in a single leap in the anime. In addition to being strong, Pound is also quite durable. He was able to withstand being pierced in the head by Randolph's spear while only feeling slight pain, most likely due to the large size of his head. He also managed to survive Oven's attempt on his life. He also has great eyesight, as he could identify and recognize his daughter Chiffon from a very far distance. Similarly, he could clearly see his grandson Pez from miles away."},

{"name": "Portgas D. Ace", "episode": "Episode 154", "chapter": "Chapter 91", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Ace was a tall muscular young man with curly black hair. Although they were not blood related, Ace looked remarkably like his foster brother, Luffy. However, Ace was more serious looking than Luffy's lighthearted design, and was also taller and more muscular. He also sported rather childish freckles (inherited from his mother) and tended to make a skeptical facial expression by raising his left eyebrow. Interestingly, his facial features were almost akin to his biological father Gol D. Roger in his youth without his mustache. Ace's tattoos were among his most remarkable, trademark features. He had a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbolpurple bones formed in a cross behind a purple skull with a white mustachethat he described as his pride and joy. Ace had another tattoo on his upper left bicep that spells \"ASCE\" vertically. The \"S\" crossed out is a tribute to Sabo as that's his jolly roger. On the cover of Chapter 596 indeed, Ace's tattoo is written as \"ACE\" instead of the original \"ASCE\" as the cover is a \"what if\" image of Ace, Luffy, and Sabo together as adults with the former being known to be alive. Ace wore an open-front shirt until he received Whitebeard's tattoo - afterwards, he stopped wearing anything over his upper body except when on winter or desert islands due to the weather requirements. He wore black boots, black knee-length shorts with an eyelet-studded orange belt, and a blue pouch belted around his left leg. He also wore a short second belt with a large red \"A\" on the silver buckle over his right hip, but left it unfastened and threaded the free end along the back of his shorts. A dagger in a green sheath hung at his left hip. On Ace's left arm, he wore a Log Pose and a red and white striped bracelet around his wrist, an orange elbow guard, and his \"ASCE\" tattoo. He wore a red beaded necklace and an orange hat with two blue smileys, one frowning and one smiling, and a string of red beads sitting above the rim. Two long orange side straps hung down sides of his hat and met at a large medallion of a bull's skull with orange tassels. Unfortunately, Ace lost his trademark hat, which he already had when he began his journey as a pirate, on Banaro Island as a result of his duel with Blackbeard. His knife was also apparently confiscated, as he no longer had it in his next appearance as a prisoner at Impel Down. The tattoo upon his back that he took so much pride in was later destroyed by the same blow that eventually led to his death. However, at his grave, Ace's hat and knife were placed at his tombstoneeither they were retrieved, or they were duplicates in Ace's possession. During the ending credits in the second movie, Clockwork Island Adventure, previews of upcoming characters from the Baroque Works Saga were featured. Ace was also included amongst the many characters, but while his clothes were almost identical, he boasted a very different color scheme to the one he was given in his official appearance in the anime. As a child, Ace is shown to have often worn t-shirts with two-kanji phrases on the front (such as \"innocence\" and \"violence\"). On some occasions they are linked to the scene in which they were worn, like \"independence\" when the three brothers built their own tree house to live in. He often wore knee-length shorts and a black elbow guard on his left arm. Ace was always seen wearing dark brown, flat, slipper-like shoes, and in the winter, he wore a green cardigan over his normal clothes. Upon leaving Dawn Island at the age of 17, he wore an outfit identical to the one he wore when he first met Whitebeard; however, he was less muscular than he eventually grew to be and had rounder, more childlike facial features.", "personality": "Ace was much more intelligent, polite, and generally, more bearable than Luffy, which prompted the Straw Hat Pirates to question whether he was truly related to their captain. While several people who knew Gol D. Roger noted Luffy is quite similar to the late Pirate King, Whitebeard himself claimed that Ace's personality was not at all like his father's. It seems that among the very few things the brothers shared was their recklessness as pirates (and their near-bottomless stomachs). In addition, Ace liked to party as much as his brother does. When he boarded Buggy's ship, he was drawn by the smell of food and decided to enjoy himself while he was there. Ace could be a bit inappropriate though as he once used a woman's skirt to wipe his face while he was dining at Spice Bean in Arabasta. There were two running gags about Ace. The first was his rather extreme narcolepsy. He tended to randomly fall asleep while eating and conversing, leaving strangers around him wondering if he had died. This was first seen in Arabasta when they thought he died in the middle of eating. The second was that he did a \"dine and dash\" routine wherever he went. This went back to his younger days with Sabo and Luffy, when they would often dine and dash in the city of Goa, and carried over to adulthood, as shown on three occasions when he was on Drum Island, Arabasta, and Lulusia Kingdom. Ace was also shown to be quite impulsive, much like his younger brother, as he too would make hasty decisions and, in some cases, neglect listening to reason. This was shown that shortly prior to setting out to hunt Blackbeard for killing Thatch. Whitebeard insisted that Ace should not go after him, yet Ace, despite his immense loyalty and respect for his captain, ignored his warnings and went off to find his former subordinate. Another, albeit more humorous example, was in his mini-story, where during his hunt for Blackbeard, he mistook a man named Dr. Blackbeard for his target, due to coincidentally having a similar name and appearance to Teach. Rather than check to see if he found the man he was looking for, Ace jumped to conclusions too soon and attacked the doctor on sight. It was by then Ace realized too late that he had the wrong man, which got him into a lot of trouble with the villagers. His \"politeness\" is due to Makino's teaching after Ace asked her how to introduce himself to Shanks (being his brother's savior). Before that, Ace was rather cold and rude to anyone he was not familiar with. As the son of Roger, he lived in his shadow and is to date the first D. depicted to truly question his own right to exist, while displaying the fewest commonly seen D. related traits. Ace seemed to have lifelong problems dealing with his parentage, even after denouncing Gol D. Roger and accepting Whitebeard as his only father. This was in direct contrast to Luffy, who accepted his father's identity immediately upon learning it and did not seem to care when he was told how dangerous of a man he was. However, Luffy did not grow up with knowledge of the identity (or even the existence) of his father. Ace believed that it was natural if he were to really die as nobody in the world wanted the son of the devil (Roger) to live. This caused him to be surprised and shocked that Whitebeard would easily accept him in his crew despite him being the son of Whitebeard's rival and that the entire Whitebeard Pirates' crew and allies and Luffy would risk their lives in order to save him. Ace commented upon his own death that he had never sought fame or fortune - all he had wanted was the answer to his lifelong question of whether or not he should have been born, as this was the only thing preventing him from dying with no regrets as he and Luffy had vowed to do so and the fact he had a younger brother to look out for. Ace's only regret was that he would not live to see Luffy achieve his dream, which he believed Luffy undoubtedly would accomplish as he was his little brother. Benn Beckman of the Red Hair Pirates described Ace's personality to be naiver than his appearance would suggest. He compared Ace's characteristics to be more aligned with the Revolutionary Army's, considering his personal vendetta against the world denying his existence. Ace is described to be more of a fighter than a Pirate, making Beckman think Ace is unfit to be captain of a fleet. Ace had a tendency to never back down from a fight, saying that he would never run once facing an enemy. Also like his father and brother, Ace was confident and fearless when confronting his opponents even when they were extremely powerful people such as Whitebeard or admirals like Aokiji or Akainu, though like Luffy, he could also underestimate his opponents. When Blackbeard demonstrated the power of the Yami Yami no Mi, Ace was unfazed, not viewing it as a threat to himself and only showed shock and fear when Teach used his power to grab him and cancel his Devil Fruit powers. He also tried to kill Whitebeard at least a hundred times despite the massive difference in strength between them and each of his attempts failing miserably. Because of this, some people believed that Ace had a death wish, but in truth, he wanted to prevent the people he cared for from getting hurt. Dadan stated that he inherited this tendency from his father despite loathing him. While Ace emerged victorious over enemies he refused to run from, such as Porchemy and Bluejam, his stubbornness hurt him on a number of occasions, particularly when he refused to back down against Blackbeard or Admiral Akainu. Ace was also easily provoked by and became violent towards anyone who insulted or harmed people close to him. In one of Garp's conversations with Curly Dadan, this was revealed to be a trait of Roger as well. During his childhood, Ace had a tendency to severely injure anyone who insulted Roger, though he himself disliked his biological father. After hearing about Sabo's presumed death at the hands of a World Noble, Ace quickly became bent on killing the Noble and Dadan had to pin Ace down and tie him to a tree to stop him. Ace's temper got the better of him, especially in cases when Whitebeard, proclaimed by Ace to be his only father, was insulted. Believing that this was the case when Blackbeard broke the iron rule of the Whitebeard Pirates and fled after murdering a crewmate, Ace pursued his traitorous subordinate despite his crewmates' efforts and even Whitebeard's orders to stop him. Ace later came to see that his stubbornness had gotten him into the ordeal of being scheduled for execution. Even though he managed to escape death on the scaffold thanks to the pirates' and Luffy's efforts at Marineford and was well on his way to freedom, Admiral Akainu got to him by insulting Whitebeard. Ace quickly turned back to face him, ignoring his crewmates' warnings to not become angered over Akainu's provocations. Unwilling to let him get away of speaking ill of Whitebeard, Ace attacked him out of fury only to have his arm burned by Akainu's Devil Fruit powers. Akainu then took the opportunity to attack Luffy on the sideline, leading Ace to jump in, sacrificing his life to shield Luffy from the attack. While saying his last words, Ace sadly admitted to Luffy that he (Ace) wasted away all of his efforts to rescue him. Although Ace follows the creed of loyalty towards those close to him, such as taking the excessive effort to rescue Luffy from Bluejam or hunting down Teach to avenge Thatch, he was not above using underhanded methods to win a fight at times. Noted examples included trying to stab Whitebeard in his sleep or chopping him down with an axe from behind. Alongside his loyalty is Ace does not judge people by their appearance and race, but by their character, as he took in both Ganryu (a Longarm) and Wallace (a Fish-Man) into his crew while society had shunned both of them.", "abilities_and_powers": "As commander of the 2nd division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Ace had authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. In addition, as one of the top commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, he was one of the strongest and most highly regarded pirates on board under Whitebeard himself. At one point, while being captain of the Spade Pirates, he was even asked to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea but refused. Ace was strong enough to be acknowledged by the Emperors Shanks and Blackbeard, with the former saying he had earned his spot as Whitebeard's 2nd division commander and the latter wishing Ace had joined his crew and emphasizing how his own formidable crew was nowhere near strong enough to combat Ace at the time, speaking volumes about Ace's strength. Luffy commented on how he never defeated Ace in a single fight, despite Luffy already having the power of the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Ace did not consume the Mera Mera no Mi until after he left: Luffy was surprised by Ace's new power when Ace stopped Smoker from capturing him in Nanohana). Ace was trained by Garp, who had hoped to turn him into a fine Marine, and possibly Dadan, the two of whom were responsible for training Luffy to the level of power he held before becoming a pirate. Ace also held a fearsome reputation. It was revealed that Ace received an invitation to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea while he was still captain of the Spade Pirates, though he refused the offer, which had subsequently raised his bounty over 100,000,000 and attracted even more attention to him across the New World. He had defeated Doma, a notorious New World pirate, and his pirate crew all on his own, which is what got him recommended for his current post as the Whitebeard Pirates' 2nd division commander. Due to Ace's prestige and heritage, the World Government not only granted Blackbeard the position of Warlord for successfully defeating and capturing Ace but also imprisoned Ace in Level 6 of Impel Down, a secret level reserved for the world's most dangerous and brutal criminals. His overall reputation and abilities had earned him a bounty of 550,000,000 prior to his capture and death. According to Sengoku, Ace had especially immense potential, described that it was Ace's rapid rise in power and fame that made the World Government realize he was son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He went on to say that in time, Ace could potentially become the next Pirate King if he continued on, which was the most important reason why the World Government was willing to start a war with Whitebeard. Chinjao himself said that Ace showed the most potential among the new generation pirates, and that his death was a good thing for the Marines. He was also a capable navigator, as he was seen wearing a Log Pose on his left wrist, while traveling from island to island in search of Luffy and Blackbeard on a simple raft. This also shows he was a skilled tracker. Ace's willpower was strong enough to withstand Shanks' outburst of Haoshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Pickles", "episode": "Episode 309", "chapter": "Chapter 210", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Pickles is a large, husky man that typically wears green schemed clothes. He haslong arms and short legs in comparison to his body. He also has a hippo-like face. On his shoulders, he typically wears round shoulder pauldrons. In size, Pickles is larger than Hamburg and smaller than Big Pan.", "personality": "Pickles has a lustful attitude toward strong opponents, getting excited when Foxy selects him and his team, the Groggy Monsters, to compete in the Groggy Ring. He is also very impatient, yelling at his opponents for taking to long to pick their ball-man. While he finds arguing annoying, he is amused when his opponents are unable to work well together. He is quite cocky abouthis and his team's abilities, and he quickly becomes nervous when a strong opponent catches him off guard. Pickles lacks respect for his opponents, as he is willing to cheat against them to win (a standard behavior for the Foxy Pirates). He never openly acknowledges his own cheating and rather celebrates his own victories despite his use of foul play. He seems to enjoy hurting his opponents, smirking and laughing when he and his team viciously assaulted Sanji and Zoro during their match. When Pickles revealed his swords against Zoro and Sanji, he mockingly laughed and sang about slicing them up, demonstrating his devious nature. Like the rest of the Groggy Monsters, Pickles is a bit dumb and tends to laugh regularly with little reason. He, however, seems to be the smartest and strongest of the three, and was defeated last by Zoro and Sanji. When his crew was defeated in a Davy Back Fight by the Straw Hat Pirates, Pickles was mature and respectful of their victory. He seemed prepared for a new challenge when the Straw Hat Pirates were deciding who to pick for their crew, and he was shocked and appalled like the rest of his crew by their decision to take their Jolly Roger and replace it with Luffy's drawing.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pickles' specialty is tackling and spinning. He is capable of tackling down opponents as well as spinning at great speeds. While he is a formidable opponent by himself, he is made more formidable when teamed up with his teammates, Hamburg and Big Pan. Together they are capable of performing team combinations that often overwhelm their opponents. In the special, Adventure of Nebulandia, Pickles fights with his fists. However, his use of this combat style is non-canon."},

He's solid red on the sides of his head, the back of his head, and on his horn-like ears. He also has bandages wrapped around his torso. He has a tab face, with a yellow beak. When in his hybrid bird-horse form, he transforms into a horse with wings that maintain the pink body with red polka dot design, but with white feathers. His face also elongates to that of a horse's. In a way, he is supposed to resemble a Pegasus.", "personality": "As Gan Fall's pet and stead, he is very loyal to his master, going as far as to bite anyone who talks bad about him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pierre ate the Uma Uma no Mi, a Zoan-class Devil Fruit which allows him to turn into a full horse. This is supposed to allow Gan Fall to ride Pierre and travel in the skies, but as noted by the Straw Hat crew, since Pierre is already able to carry Gan Fall in his original giant bird form his power seems quite useless aside from the aesthetic effect. However, Pierre can use his powers as a horse offensively (albeit for comedic effects), by using his horse teeth to bite the head of anyone who's talking bad about his master in front of him."},
{"name": "Pica", "episode": "Episode 700", "chapter": "Chapter 629", "year": 2013, "note": "His name was revealed by Wicca in Chapter 722.", "appearance": "Pica is an extremely broad, tall, intimidating and muscular man. It is shown in a flashback that even as a nine-year-old child he possessed a similar hulking frame, while also wearing a silvery metal chainmail headguard and a pale yellow knights helmet, in addition to a white sleeveless t-shirt and black pants, that he would have until adulthood. By the age of 24, he had replaced his makeshift armor from childhood to real golden armor and took to wearing black gloves. His hair is long and lavender, wavy and light, which hangs down to his shoulders. It appears that under his mask, he has a straight mustache. His eyes are yellow. The most distinctive features on his body are his shoulders, which have three (previously two) spikes protruding out of each shoulder blade that appears to be part of his actual flesh; his shoulder grew to this point since he was wearing shoulder guards of such shape since puberty, thus causing them to shape like so. He is considerably taller than normal people, appearing as tall as Trebol and Diamante. There is a tattoo of a (black in the manga, purple in the anime) spade on the front side of both his shoulders. He wears a yellow-gold spiked helmet with a narrow four-pointed star on the front with a spade on the top point; the star covers his eyes in a visor-like fashion. Ten years ago, he wore dark gauntlets and white bandages on both of his hands that go up halfway to his shoulders. He also wears a metallic belt with a black spade emblem with a light-colored outline on the front attached by chains in a manner resembling suspenders, albeit with chains wrapping around his hips and from front-to-back instead around his body, over a pteruges skirt in the manga. In the anime they are golden-yellow colored. Underneath his pteruges is a pair of dark underwear. He also wears a pair of light-colored greaves, and a large pair of black gloves (golden-yellow in the anime) that reaches up to his forearms. His most recent appearance also shows him wearing a light-colored spade shaped armored chest plate with the spade symbol attached by light-colored leather straps and a metal chain in-between the light-colored leather straps at the top, with armor plating stretched and wrapped around his sides, and black and white armbands (light-brown and yellow gold in the anime) just around his elbows. Of all the elite officers of the Donquixote Pirates, he is the most muscular and with the biggest and widest arms, hands and fingers, which are adorned with black gloves (purple in the anime) that reach up to his forearms. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Pica is shown with a large frame, wearing only a small vest which exposed his chest, tattered shorts, and wore no shoes.", "personality": "Pica seems to be a quiet individual, likely due to his surprisingly high pitched voice for his size. He is extremely sensitive about his voice, and in the event he does speak and is laughed at, he gets extremely upset, going as far as to brutally murder people for it. He also has some pride in his sword, as he was offended just as easily when Zoro insulted is laugh. He is very loyal to Doflamingo as he abandoned his battle with Zoro to protect Doflamingo after the Warlord's string puppet was decapitated by Kyros. He also considers his crew as his family, as he set out personally to seek out the enemies who threaten their safety. Likewise, he firmly believes Doflamingo is the rightful king of Dressrosa and the country belongs to the family. Pica is also dishonest with wounded gladiators, attacking them indiscriminately. However, as seen when Machvise ran from Pica's large scale attack after Luffy angered the latter, there are times where his anger gets the better of him and he may neglect the safety of his family. Also, he did not hesitate to insult Diamante for losing to Kyros, while not even bothering to give Baby 5 a chance to explain anything before attacking her for assumed treason. He believes strongly in his Devil Fruit abilities, saying that he alone would be enough to defeat the enemies in Dressrosa and prevent them from getting to Doflamingo. He openly said that three or three hundred people made no difference to him. He is also confident in his Haki claiming Zoro would be unable to cut him after he imbued his entire body with it. This arrogance led him to underestimating Zoro, who defeated him with his own Haki. Like many One Piece characters, Pica has a distinct laugh: \"Pikkya-pikkya-pikkyarara\", something he's also sensitive about.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pica occupies the Spade seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Pica Army, with Gladius, Buffalo, and Baby 5 (before her defection), all of whom specialized as an assault squad, as his subordinates. Even as a 9-year-old, Pica was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Trebol and Diamante, all of whom were children, as well as possessing knowledge of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki are qualified to become king. At 30 years old, Pica, along with Trebol and Diamante, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Viola also expressed worry during multiple instances regarding the interference of Pica in Luffy, Zoro, and Viola's entering of the royal palace, which further suggests Pica's might. Pica himself was confident that he alone was all that was necessary to put an end to the Straw Hats and former Colosseum fighters."},

He, like the rest of the crew, calls her beautiful simply to avoid her Iron Mace.", "abilities_and_powers": "Peppoko wielded a sword against Luffy that was broken by him.

Like most of the Heart Pirates, he wears a beige overall, with their Jolly Roger displayed on the back and the chest pocket, as well as brown boots. He wears a black cap with a yellow brim, a red pompon on top and his name displayed on the front. His appearance after the timeskip is pretty much the same as before except the red pompomhas now been replaced with a decoration that looks like a young emperor penguin, probably as a reference to his name. In Wano, he wore a light blue yukata with the Heart Pirates' jolly roger on each side of the chest. He also carries a sword athis side.", "personality": "Like Shachi, he likes women and is loyal to his captain, Law. As a teenager, he was a bully who was prone to mocking people and picking fights.", "abilities_and_powers": "Having grown up in a North Blue port, Penguin is an experienced swimmer.

{"name": "Perona", "episode": "Episode 443", "chapter": "Chapter 338", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Perona is a short young woman with unusually big, round eyes, and she has long, light pink hair that she keeps tied into two pigtails with black and white flower hairpins. She wears a red crown with a black cross on her head, as well as red lipstick and a thick layer of black eyeliner. Her white long-sleeved three different black heart shapes shirt was short enough to expose her belly.She wears a red mini cape with a pink ribbon on front. Her black and white striped tights completely cover her legs, and she wears a mini-skirt and a red and gold belt with a heart belt buckle, as well as red buckled boots. She usually keeps her toes pointing inwards in a pigeon-toed manner and carried around a red parasol shaped like a cute version of a mini devil prior to her battle with Usopp. As a child, Perona carried the same parasol and wore the same crown and hairpins but wore her hair in much thicker pigtails and wore a simple, knee-length red dress with a white wave pattern and dots around its center, as well as smaller red boots. She also carried a ghost doll around on a leash and was accompanied by a bear named Kumae. When first meeting Hogback ten years prior to her encounter with the Straw Hat Pirates, Perona wore the same crown, but the rest of her outfit was not clearly visible, though she seemed to be wearing a similar dress. After the two-year timeskip, Perona has a more mature look than before, wearing a long black strapless dress with lavender frills, red high heeled boots and a big black top hat with white floral decor. She has a pink bat tattoo on her left bicep and a watch on her left wrist and wears pink nail polish on her fingernails. She still has her signature parasol, and also carries a stuffed animal resembling Kumashi with her. Additionally, she now wears her hair in multiple spiral braids on the back of her head. While reading about the Straw Hats' actions on Dressrosa and resulting new bounties, she wore a collared shirt with short, ruffled sleeves and a short dark tie hung loosely around her neck. She wore short frilly skirt witha line of crosses. She had short boots with bows on the front. She also had a large straw hat with a bow and large crown on top of it.", "personality": "Perona has a very young, childlike and immature personality; frequently acting selfishly and on her own whims. She dislikes people telling her what to do and disobeying her will. Despite this, she is normally loyal to Gecko Moria and apparently sees him as a father-like role model, as she was crying to rejoin him after being sent to Kuraigana Island. After Zoro appeared on Kuraigana as well, she tended to his wounds, displaying a willingness to befriend even those she formerly knew as a foe and demonstrating that she can be kind to others, despite her normally cruel demeanor. She is very fond of cute things and will only allow someone to work for her if they are cute. Her dream is to create a kingdom where all the cute things in the world have been turned into zombie animals that obey only her. She dislikes Kumashi because, although he is cute in appearance, his voice is not, and thus she prefers him to just be quiet. Her desire for cute things gives her a slightly childish outlook on some issues. She is somewhat playful during combat, threatening to crush Usopp's heart when she was in her ghost form, which nearly caused Usopp to die from fear, and shortly afterward merely laughing it off when revealing that she could not do so. Perona has katsaridaphobia, a fear of cockroaches, to the point of screaming and crying when Usopp covered her with fake ones. She is also somewhat naive, having watched Usopp seemingly lift a 10-ton hammer without questioning whether or not his feat was genuine, and shortly afterward passing out from fear when he attacked her with it, despite not actually being harmed. She is very confident in her Devil Fruit powers being able to defeat anyone. Even when confronted by the powerful and dreaded Warlord of the Sea Bartholomew Kuma, after initially being frozen with fear, Perona quickly regained her confidence and proclaimed that she would defeat him. She is also quite stubborn about using them in combat, having continued to use her Negative Hollows against Usopp even after they proved useless due to his negativity because she believed that his immunity was a fluke. After the timeskip, she has become more mature, although she still carries a teddy bear around, indicating that she is still obsessed with cuteness to some degree. She displayed a grateful side, as she tearfully thanked Dracule Mihawk for letting her stay on his island. Like many others, Perona has her own unique laugh, which uses the word Horo (e.g., \"Horo-horo-horo-horo-horo!\"); this is based on the name of her Devil Fruit, the Horo Horo no Mi.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being formerly one of the Mysterious Four, Perona had a number of zombies under her command prior to her defection from Thriller Bark. Her ex-crewmate, Doctor Hogback, acknowledges her value under Moria's employment.

He also shares Krieg's belief of using any means to achieve victory, even if it means playing dirty.

His upper body is covered with intricate tattoos, green on his chest, and red on his arms. He wears pants that have lighter colored stripes around his waist and on the top of the legs, and standard shoes. During the travel on the Rocketman, he was seen wearing an unbuttoned, brightly colored sleeveless shirt and carried a pair of katanas on his back. After the timeskip his appearance is nearly the same, but his mustache is thinner and straighter and the part of his hair sticking up is bigger and more conical. When he learns about Franky's new bounty, the part of his hair sticking up consists of four small parts. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In One Piece Film: Red, he retains his appearance from before the timeskip, despite the movie taking place after it. Concludes non-canon section.", "personality": "Lulu seems to take his work very seriously and he cares very much for both his fellow co-workers and employer.

He was willing to protect Vivi from Miss All-Sunday, regardless of how powerful she was. He has also shown strong loyalty to Arabasta, as he selflessly sacrificed himself to save the country from the exploding time bomb Crocodile had set. Pell appears to have a soft side, gently conversing with Vivi as a child when she asked about his role as a guardian, and using his Devil Fruit abilities to give her a ride.

He often holds his fists up in a confrontational manner and hangs his tongue out of the side of his mouth.Despite having large paws for hands, his feet are evidently small enough to fit into the small boots he wears. He wears a pink suit, black sunglasses, a silver earring on his left ear, a sword on his right hip, and wears black high-heeled boots with white ruffled brims.He also wears a salmon-colored dress shirt underneath his suit jacket. Five years ago, he wore the same outfit as his current appearance but with a white inner shirt.

He also has a liking for chocolate, and is willing to admit that to people. He carries around a list of bounties on wanted people such as pirates and takes note of the people he has seen on bounty posters, as seen when he took the time to look up Caribou even when the latter was about to fire at him with a Gatling gun. He acknowledges that merely possessing a Logia-type Devil Fruit does not make the user invincible, commenting that anyone who thinks so will have a swift downfall. He has some level of pride in his own Devil Fruit abilities, as he expressed mild disappointment that Luffy did not react to his fruit's defensive capabilities being likened to diamond. He also has a strong attachment to his former home as shown when he offered to let the Straw Hats go when he found out they saved the Mink Tribe from Jack. He was even willing to lie to Big Mom to help them. He was also willing to capture his own crewmate Charlotte Brle in order to honor Pedro's sacrifice for the Straw Hats.

While grumpy with a ferocious temper, Pekoms genuinely cares for the people he is close to, as shown when he broke down crying when Pedro was almost killed by Big Mom's life span absorption powers.

He gave up his left eye to Big Mom during his time as a pirate captain, and afterwards covered his scar with his hair. He also had a torn left ear. Upon entering Totto Land, Pedro donned a dress shirt with floral-like frills down the middle, a dark cape with the same frills on the edge, and a large dark hat which partially obscures his face. When meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, he wore a green suit with a black shirt and a red ascot along with a green fedora.", "personality": "Pedro was extremely loyal to whomever he follows, and was often overly eager to use violence to help his allies during tense situations without waiting for discussion. As a Guardian, he was willing to lay down his life in order to defend the Whale Forest against intruders, though he admitted that he and the rest of the Guardians are a bit too sensitive to intruders, and would call off an attack if asked to do so. However, when not on duty as a Guardian, Pedro could be very cautious and distrusting toward strangers, quickly preparing to use force against anyone he feels may be a threat to him and his friends even if they seem to be friendly, as demonstrated during his first encounter with Charlotte Pudding. He seemed to like standing in trees and other high places, as fitting for his nickname, and was sometimes intense when he got up close to people. According to Tamago, Pedro used to highly prioritize his own survival when he was a pirate captain. He willingly gave up his left eye in order to prove to Big Mom that he needed to return to Zou alive and witness \"the dawn of the world\". Pedro believed this dream has come to fruition with the Straw Hats, so he was fine with dying as soon as his obligations to the Straw Hats were fulfilled. As a result, he became a rather reckless fighter willing to go great lengths against enemies due to his lack of regard for his own safety. He was also very perceptive and cautious; he was the only member of the Sanji Retrieval Team to be suspicious of Charlotte Pudding's motives due to her connection to Big Mom, which was later proven correct. He also berated Carrot for stowing away on the journey to Totto Land, reminding her of the danger they were heading into.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Guardians, Pedro had command over them, though his position and authority were below those of Nekomamushi. He also had full command over the Nox Pirates as their captain until they were defeated and dissolved. Nonetheless, the World Government acknowledged his strength and threat as a pirate, enough to have a 382,000,000 bounty placed on his head. Having traveled through the seas in search of Poneglyphs, Pedro was experienced and knowledgeable of various facts, such as the geography of Totto Land and the hierarchy and powers of the Big Mom Pirates.

His hair is blond and slicked back on his head while wearing a pair of orange goggles on top. These goggles were cracked on the right side for the second half of the Water 7 arc and the duration of the Enies Lobby arc as a result of his fight with Rob Lucci and Kaku. He is quite muscular, and his attire is completed by a yellow T-shirt, with white concentric circles in the middle of it, a belt around his waist with a little bag attached to it, and a pair of loose trousers tucked inside his boots.

He apparently enjoys gambling, as he has many debts to pay off and is often pursued by debt-collectors. When he is first introduced, he tries to steal two suitcases full of money from Luffy to pay off his gambling debts. Though he is thwarted by Lucci and pulled back on land by his ear and gives back the suitcases, he asks for 10% of the cash if Luffy really wanted to thank him, shortly before being knocked over the head by Lucci with a hammer.

He sometimes feigns an understanding attitude, as he recognized that it was the fault of the Lulusia Kingdom royalty and the Marines that Lulusia Kingdom was left unprotected, but his only real care is for treasure, as he hit a woman after finding out what treasure the Lulusia Kingdom held. Peachbeard is also very expressive and quick to shock and anger, as he vocally expressed his bewilderment at the presence of four Revolutionary Army commanders on Lulusia Kingdom as well as their personalities and abilities.

His brand is quite popular and well known, as some citizens of Fish-Man Islanders suspected King Neptune's invitation to the Straw Hat Pirate's was due to them being acquainted with Pappag.

Indeed, cameos of his name have appeared scattered throughout the series in both katakana and romaji script.", "personality": "Little has been established about Pandaman's personality in canon - save, perhaps, for his cowardice in constantly fleeing from debt collectors.

He has sharp and angular, green eyes set under slightly heavy, hairless brow ridges, as well as a pair of small, upward-curving horns on the sides of his head (similar to, but smaller than Ulti's). A tattoo of his name in block capitals (dark-cyan with light-green outlines) frontally occupies his upper body, in a right-to-left tilt upward: the \"P\" being on his right biceps, \"AGE\" across his chest, and \"1\" on his left deltopectoral groove. Like his sister, Page One dons a mask over his lower face up to the nose, split down the middle into a white (right) and black (left) half, as well as a laterally horned bucket hat (matching the horns beneath) that like the mask is bicolored: white on the right and green on the left. Otherwise, for clothes, the man sports a nearly ankle-length cape held closed by a single yellow cord below its standup collar, colored white on its outside and light-purple on its inside, with a darker-purple hem. Under said cape, he wears a white-colored shirt with long, cuffed sleeves, a point collar, and a gray necktie. His hands are kept in gray (black in the manga), tight-fitting gloves that reach below the elbows, mostly hidden by said sleeves. Above his waistline is a green (dark-blue in the manga) abdominal wrap, frontally held together by brown, double-crisscrossed lacing.

Tucked into them above is a half-skirt piece colored the same, hanging down over the upper backside of his legs, with a brown belt visible that bears a golden skull buckle. The pants are tucked into a high-shafted boots of a similar tone (a darker green in the anime) as the pants.", "personality": "Around peers and superiors, Page One tends to display a rather serious and reserved, if slightly meek, disposition, driven to follow objectives with a single-minded and no-nonsense approach while not rejoining to insults leveled at him by his fellow Tobiroppo. He is usually the first to be exasperated at his sister Ulti's quirky antics, especially so should they devolve into disrespect toward higher authorities, and is flustered by her childish displays of affection for him. Yet, when in combat, Page One shows himself fully confident in his power, if not disposed to arrogance, and has been seen with a wilder, more thuggish side to him. Believing that anyone rebelling against the administration of Wano should be made an example of, he has no qualms about a powerful pirate like him being sent to deal with such a matter. He was willing to use the hunt for a single defiant food vendor in Sanji as an excuse to destroy and devour the contents of multiple unrelated food stands in the Flower Capital, telling their owners to scream for the offender to show himself if they wanted the destruction to cease. Therewhile, the man exhibited a degree of gluttony, gorging on soba noodles from the shops he wrongly attacked and at one point deciding to attack a fruit shop just because he felt like snacking on fruit.

He even told him, almost outright, that one of the reasons behind Sterry's adoption was so that the family could have another child in case Sabo failed the family in the future, as well as stated that a child's happiness should come from pleasing their parents. This shows that he does not have very much faith, if any, in his son's success.

Her golden blonde hair was partially held up in two loops, much like her daughter Shirahoshi only shorter, by an orange headpiece. She also had green eyes (blue in the anime), thick eyelashes, and wore pink lipstick. She was usually seen wearing a very long white kimono with a cream-colored carp-scale design along the hem and a sash around her shoulders that floated behind her head much like her children.", "personality": "Otohime was very open-minded as she tried to promote friendship between fish-men and humans. She stated how despite having different morphology, they share the same sun. She claimed that Fish-Men and merfolk shouldn't judge all humans by the few that come to Fish-Man Island, kidnap and sell them to slavery. Due to her Kenbunshoku Haki abilities, she believed that distance was the closure of a person's heart and so long as distance separates the person's heart from others there will always be a barrier between them and the humans. But this same barrier was not just between humans and themselves, but between their own people also. This is why she preferred to visit the people directly and speak to them face-to-face, rather than have a speech prepared ahead and have it relayed to the people on her behalf, to prevent a distance between the royal family and their subjects. Being extremely compassionate, Otohime was very devoted to the welfare of her people since she disregarded her own injuries (as she was weaker than normal Fish-Men/merfolk) while acting for the greater good, personally taking care of a simple matter of stopping a burglar, despite her subjects claiming that they had it under control. Her devotion made her popular with the Fish-Man Island citizens. She was also very encouraging and influential, as she told a burglar that she believed he could turn his life around, prompting him to turn over a new leaf and surrendering to the authorities. Despite all this, it was not enough to get many citizens to sign her petition for inter-species relationship improvement. Even though she hardly had any success, she remained persistent and would never stop believing in co-existence. She was also very bold and courageous, accompanying a World Noble to the surface in order to prove to her people that the surface shouldn't be feared, despite the Noble that showed extreme cruelty and ungratefulness. She appeared to be very moody, going from being angry, to sorrowful, to hopeful in just a matter of minutes. She was also somewhat compulsive and peculiar, as she thought that a child should never have snot hanging from one nostril, going as far as slapping the said child for it and then apologizing, but that it is perfectly acceptable if snot is hanging from both. However, this did not seem to apply to her own children, at least not Shirahoshi (though she was just a baby at the time). There was one occasion when she was emotionally stressed, she consumed vast amounts of alcohol in sorrow and berated the island over the broadcast radio, all while intoxicated. As part of her immense desire to strengthen the bonds between humanity and fish folks, Otohime was also very merciful and kind, and did not hate anyone despite whatever offense they have made. She further tried to have others to let go of their hatred, believing that it should not be passed onto the next generation; while she understood the Sun Pirates for hating Mjosgard, she tried to persuade them to forgive him and not let the children around inherit such hatred. Even when she was shot by Hody Jones, she did not hate him and pleaded her children to not hate him either.

With the combination of these Dials and his Mantra, Ohm is extremely powerful in combat and can use his weaponry to take out most opponents with relative ease, including being able to briefly spar equally with Gan Fall and greatly challenge the powerful swordsman Roronoa Zoro in their sparring match. Ohm is also a \"skybreeder\" who is extremely proficient in training animals, as evidenced by his giant dog Holy, whom he has trained in hand-to-hand combat to an exceptionally human-like degree. Holy is a powerful fighter and will fight alongside his master on command, substantially increasing Ohm's threat to opponents."},

Oimo does not take kindly to enemies threatening his friends or mocking him, but his rage can cause him to act rashly, such as when he tried to hit the Franky Family standing on Kashii's body and ended up striking Kashii instead. Oimo was even willing to devote 100 years of his life to working for the World Government just to save his two captains from imprisonment, and when he thought he had failed in this duty, he wept bitterly. After allying with the Franky Family and Galley-La Company, Oimo and Kashii were even willing to risk themselves for them, as shown when they took the brunt of the Buster Call's fire to keep their allies out of harm's way. Oimo is very confident in his power as a giant and has no issue with using excessive force against smaller opponents. He takes the pride and customs of Elbaf extremely seriously, viewing Dorry and Brogy's duel to the death as natural and nearly becoming very angry at Usopp when briefly under the impression that the pirate was mocking the giants' pride. Like Kashii, Oimo does not take kindly to being deceived, and so immediately turned against the World Government after finding out they had lied to put them in service.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a giant from Elbaf and a former member of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Oimo is a very powerful warrior. Together with Kashii, he guarded the main gate to Enies Lobby without fail for 50 years.

After defecting against the World Government, Oimo and Kashii quickly became a fearsome threat against the legions of guards and soldiers in Enies Lobby, although they were eventually subdued by the guards' vast numbers and tied up. Oimo and Kashii have a notable degree of seafaring skill, as they were able to navigate the treacherous New World on their way to find Dorry and Brogy, although they ended up being captured by the Marines."},

{"name": "Oars", "episode": "Episode 456", "chapter": "Chapter 350", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Oars is an extremely large, red-skinned, skull-faced zombie who is more than four times the size of an average giant; his sheer size caused Roronoa Zoro and Franky to mistake his body for a large wall upon encountering it up close. Oars has two large horns and long yellow hair that flows from his head to his back. His upper teeth are squared, while his lower teeth are pointed with long canines. He is missing his right eye, and his left arm has \"SZ-900\" tattooed on it, \"SZ\" representing \"Special Zombie\" and \"900\" being his zombie classification number. Like other zombies, he is completely stitched up, save for a small portion of his upper right pectoral area that has decayed to reveal ribs and a moldering section of his right deltoid. Oars's right arm has been replaced entirely by Hogback, but the joint where his original arm had been connected was not and retains severe signs of frostbite. A blue cloth is stitched across the middle of his stomach; this is actually a curtain that opens up and leads to a compartment located where his digestive system should be. This is a cockpit where Oars's master, Gecko Moria, can sit and watch Oars battle or aid him with his own powers. Apart from the various bandages covering his limbs, Oars wears only a large black loin cloth adorned by three gigantic skulls and a large cross pattern in front strapped onto a rope holding it up.", "personality": "Oars's personality in life is largely unknown, though Hogback implies that he was a ferocious beast hailing from a clan of giants who were especially evil; Oars, in particular, was well known and feared. However, Oars was also very dense, given Chopper's assessment that he ended up dying not from old age or injuries sustained in battle, but by walking around in an extremely cold environment wearing only his loincloth. Due to being implanted with Luffy's shadow, Oars inherited several of Luffy's personality traits, including Luffy's desire to become the Pirate King. Oars is also unable to tell that Usopp and Sogeking are actually one and the same, but thinks Sanji and his badly-drawn bounty poster look exactly alike. He also retains Luffy's excitability, becoming shocked when he learned that the Straw Hats could not complete Pirate Docking Six due to Robin refusing to take part in it, and shares Luffy's carnivorous nature, having been distracted by being told that there was a large pile of meat to his right. Oars also remembered certain things about Luffy's abilities; he found that it was weird that he did not stretch when using Gomu Gomu no Pistol and found stretching to feel familiar when Moria later helped him do so.", "abilities_and_powers": "In life, Oars was an extremely strong beast, having been given the epithet \"Continent Puller\" due to his sheer power; with Luffy's shadow animating him as a zombie, he retains his enormous strength, allowing him to perform feats of incredible strength like destroying enormous chains restraining his body simple by standing up, shattering a large portion of a thick steel freezer with a single punch, easily moving the massive rudder of Thriller Bark by himself, defeating all the General Zombies at once with a barrage of punches, and breaking a tower off its foundation to use as a weapon, while his sheer size and weight grant his attacks enough power to effortlessly destroy large buildings. Despite his massive size, Oars is surprisingly fast, having launched a surprise attack on the General Zombies by quickly leaping into the air before they could restrain him and later avoided several attacks from the Straw Hat Pirates with his speed and reflexes. In addition, his body is incredibly durable; simply disabling his already damaged right arm required multiple powerful and concentrated attacks from the Straw Hat Pirates.However, according to Chopper, even Oars was not resilient enough to withstand extreme cold without proper clothing, which was the cause of his death. Due to having Luffy's shadow within him, Oars can perform some of Luffy's Devil Fruit-based techniques, namely Gomu Gomu no Pistol, Gomu Gomu no Gatling, Gomu Gomu no Kane, Gomu Gomu no Kama (notably, Oars simply sweeps a single arm at his opponent instead of clotheslining them when using this technique due to his size and inability to stretch), Gomu Gomu no Kazan, Gomu Gomu no Muchi, Gomu Gomu no Yari, Gomu Gomu no Ono, Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, Gomu Gomu no Stamp, Gomu Gomu no Rifle, and Gomu Gomu no Bullet; he also has his own technique called Gomu Gomu no Shirimochi (, Gomu Gomu no Shirimochi?, literally meaning \"Rubber Rubber Butt Stomp\"), where he leaps into the air before crushing his opponents with his large rear end. However, Oars cannot stretch his limbs like Luffy does due to not actually possessing the powers of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, though this usually does not matter due to the tremendous reach of his arms. With the aid of Gecko Moria's Kage Kakumei, Oars can stretch his limbs like Luffy does, increasing both the power and range of his attacks, as well as contort his body in ways that Luffy cannot, such as becoming a sphere for the attack Oars Ball (, zu Bru?); despite this, Oars's body still does not possess the other attributes of Luffy's rubbermost notably, he is still susceptible to attacks that Luffy can normally withstand without injury, such as blunt-force blows and lightning. Since Oars is a zombie, he is immune to pain; this allowed him to withstand and get up from the Straw Hat Pirates' attacks time after time with seemingly no limit to his stamina or how much damage he could endure, eventually requiring Luffy to completely shatter his spine. However, he still instinctively flinched when he was harmed until he fully comprehended his immunity to pain. Chopper also points out that since Oars cannot feel pain, he will not know which parts of his body are damaged. Like any living being, if his bones and nerves are badly damaged or destroyed, Oars cannot move."},

Nola has yellow eyes with narrowed black pupils, and in its mouth it has a set of four long fangs in addition to a long forked tongue.

If time goes by without the bell ringing, Nola will become sullen and even weep out of sadness. Nola will be very friendly to people who ring the bell, acting much like a pet. Being separated from people it cares for will make the snake just as sad and upset as not hearing the bell, and Nola will not forget the people it loses even after centuries have passed. After 400 years of not hearing the sound of the bell, Nola became a vicious predator feared by those who stepped foot on Upper Yard. If Nola saw a human, it would relentlessly pursue them with the intent of consuming them whole. However, when the bell was finally rung at the end of the Skypiea-Shandia war four centuries after the Shandia's arrival, Nola was overjoyed to the point of dancing for multiple days nonstop, and became friendly to the Skypieans and current generation of Shandia. If it feels pain, Nola will cry out and wildly rampage around, threatening the trees and structures around it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Thanks to its large size, Nola is capable of swallowing humans and even buildings whole, and can cause large-scale destruction to any structure it makes contact with. When the snake slammed headfirst into base of the immensely large Giant Jack at high speed after the beanstalk had been slightly weakened by Zoro, the force was strong enough to slightly tilt it. Despite Nola's size, the snake can move very quickly, making it very difficult for its prey to elude it. Nola's scales are extremely tough and durable, as Wyper was unable to damage it even with multiple blasts of his powerful Burn Bazooka. However, a large thunderbolt from Enel proved powerful enough to knock Nola unconscious. Nola can transmit venom through its fangs; the venom is powerful enough to instantly corrode trees."},

He also tends to shout his words out for no reason, including a habit of shouting his own name at random times, being followed by his whale shouting \"Hoe\". Neptune sometimes mispronounces people's names, as he refers to Zoro as \"Zori\". He appears to be easy-going, absent minded, and carefree as he was scolded by his ministers for leaving the castle on a whim on more than one occasion. He has a tendency to finish most of his his sentences with the word \"jamon\". However, he can be serious when the situation demands it, as he intended to capture the Straw Hat Pirates when they were wrongly accused of kidnapping mermaids, though Neptune did not think it was fair to arrest them based on a prediction made by Madam Shyarly, and merely wanted to capture the crew rather than arrest them for a precaution. In addition to being fair, while in his youth he would kill others for revenge, in the present he has shown to be very merciful, as he allowed the human slaves of the New Fish-Man Pirates to leave and let the lower Fish-Man subordinates to do penal work under the watch of the army. He dotes on his only daughter Shirahoshi, and worries about her immensely. He provided several extreme but necessary security measures to protect her from Vander Decken IX, and even attempted to beg the Straw Hats to rush to her aid when he thought that his daughter is in danger. Neptune apparently acknowledges the value of sacrifice, as he decided that he would rather risk his daughter's safety in the hands of strangers than in Decken's captivity. He gets quite upset when he hears that Shirahoshi is upset and gets very emotional when she is in danger as shown when he burst into tears when Shirahoshi was supposedly kidnapped and when Decken went after her. Neptune is also partially perceptive as he correctly guessed that Luffy snuck Shirahoshi out of Hard-Shell Tower by stuffing her inside Megalo, even though everyone else thought this was a bizarre idea. However, he can jump to conclusions when he stopped suspecting Luffy after Vander Decken IX appeared in the palace and quickly accused Decken of kidnapping Shirahoshi. He stated when his wife died, that even if the person who killed his wife was unarmed he would have torn them apart. However, moments later he noted Otohime would not approve of a revenge attack and though he would only have listened to those words because it came from her, he still could not understand why he could not bring himself to tear that person apart. He did not understand how the events led to the people of Fish-Man Island and humans hating each other. He however, wanted to end the cycle of hate between humans, he noted due to his past as a soldier he could not be a candidate for causing such a thing as he would only cause the opposite of his intentions to happen. He understood how the circle continued though, that children who witness darkness only continue the dark path that has caused their problems, but time could heal those scars and pain. Neptune is well aware of the Void Century and poneglyphs, as well as the dangerous potential they pose to the world. Despite doting on his daughter, he knew she is the incarnation of the deadly ancient weapon, Poseidon, and fears of her power having fully awakened. He was also shocked and seemingly slightly frightened that Nico Robin is able to read about Joy Boy in the Sea Forest's poneglyph, but trusted her enough to tell her about the history in detail when she asked. Like many other characters in the series, he appears to have a unique laugh: Hoh hoh hoh hoh.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king, he has royal authority over the entire Ryugu Kingdom. His lone presence outside the palace is enough to cause a panic. He seems to have an uncommon ability for a merman as he is able to communicate with whales; normally, they can only do so with regular fish. He uses that ability to call his pet whale, Hoe, when he needs him. He has a strong sense of danger. In the anime, he could quickly understand Zoro's strength and refrained his men from taking Zoro head on. He immediately took caution right after the New Fish-Man Pirates took Energy Steroids. He's also fully aware of the existence of Haki as he commented on Otohime's Kenbunshoku Haki skills."},
{"name": "Nekomamushi", "episode": "Episode 809", "chapter": "Chapter 756", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Nekomamushi is a large, yellow feline mink with dark brown stripes, sharp teeth, claws, and a very thick striped tail. He has wild, bushy blonde hair resembling a lion's mane running around his neck and down his back, and there is a scar running from the left side of his forehead down to his cheek. His outfit consists of a large robe decorated with circles, a haramaki around his waist, sandals, a light-colored shirt, and pants. In addition, he frequently smokes a kiseru. Like all the retainers of the Kozuki Family, Nekomamushi bears the family crest somewhere on his body. While being tortured by Jack, he lost his left hand and part of his left forearm due to several members of the Beasts Pirates spearing them off. At some point before his arrival at Onigashima, Nekomamushi replaced his lost hand with a prosthetic double-barreled gun.", "personality": "Nekomamushi takes great pride in his status as one of the Mokomo Dukedom's rulers alongside Inuarashi, having proclaimed the country to be his when the night came during his first encounter with Jack. Unlike his former friend Inuarashi, Nekomamushi is aggressive and merciless; Inuarashi has described him as an \"obstinate and stubborn imbecile\", comparing him to Jack himself, and he is completely willing to damage the historical Mokomo Dukedom while fighting, referring to doing so as a \"minor detail\". Nekomamushi can be stubborn even when not angry, as demonstrated when he kept ignoring Tony Tony Chopper's orders to recuperate in order to have fun. He does not like to be ordered around, having claimed that he went to bed of his own volition rather than on Chopper's orders while being treated by the doctor, and describes himself as a \"freedom-loving man\"; in spite of his bravado, however, he is afraid of needles. Despite his stubborn, sometimes abrasive behavior, Nekomamushi genuinely cares for his friends and fellow minks; he took care of Bepo and the other Heart Pirates when they arrived on Zou and did not expect them to help him defend the Mokomo Dukedom against the Beasts Pirates, though he was impressed when they decided to do so anyway. Additionally, while being tortured by Jack and his men, Nekomamushi convinced the Beasts Pirates to aim their spears at him instead of at his incapacitated fellow minks. He is also firmly loyal and possesses an incredibly strong will, having absolutely refused to reveal that Raizo was on Zou despite extensive torture at the hands of Jack, even when he lost his arm, and was fully willing to risk the kingdom's destruction in order to protect his friend. His loyalty to his allies means that he will treat anyone who tries to harm them viciously, having claimed he will devour any intruders he finds. Nekomamushi has many feline behaviors that can sometimes get the better of him; he likes to lick his paws, play with balls and cat toys, and eat catnip. Unlike most cats, however, he loves taking baths and eating lasagna. Like many others, Nekomamushi has his own unique laugh: \"Goronyanya\". \"Nya\" is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a cat's meow, and \"goro\" may come from \"gorogoro\", the Japanese onomatopoeia for purring.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the former two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Nekomamushi held a large amount of influence over the Mink Tribe, with the highest authority during nighttime. As the Guardian of the Whale Forest and the commander of the Guardians, Nekomamushi had full control over the forest's inhabitants, before he stepped down from his position. Nekomamushi is equal in power to his daytime counterpart and friend Inuarashi, which caused all of their battles to end in stalemates. Nekomamushi fought evenly against Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, before the latter poisoned him with Caesar Clown's Koro gas. Even while Nekomamushi was recovering from severe injuries, Sanji confidently left the protection of his comrades from the Fire Tank Pirates to him, while Capone Bege felt wary of facing him and called him a monster. During the raid on Onigashima, his Sulong-enhanced attacks were capable of injuring the Emperor Kaidou, who had assumed his Beast Form. As a former pirate, Nekomamushi is an able seaman with enough navigational skill to lead a crew formed from his Guardians through the New World. In the anime, Nekomamushi also knows how to make Vivre Cards."},
{"name": "Nefertari Vivi", "episode": "Episode 103", "chapter": "Chapter 62", "year": 1999, "note": "Her real name was revealed by Mr.5 in Chapter 110.", "appearance": "Vivi is a young woman of medium height with long wavy light blue hair, with two locks hanging down, one on either side of her head, which started out at about chin-length but were past her shoulders by her last appearance before the timeskip. According to her father, Vivi holds a strong resemblance to her mother. She most often wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, and brown eyes. She has a slender body but tends to wear less-revealing clothing than Nami and Robin do. Vivi has been seen wearing several different high heeled shoes, including white high heel boots, white high heel sandals, and blue wedges. Though she is a princess, she rarely wore clothing that would suggest her royal status while traveling with the Straw Hats, although she started to do so more regularly after her coming-of-age speech. After the timeskip, she wears her hair down but held back by a clip, and it seems a bit shorter than before. Like most female characters since the timeskip, her hourglass figure has become more pronounced. A notable facet of her appearance is that when she was a member of Baroque Works, she seemed to have been drawn in a slightly different way. While playing the role of Miss Wednesday, she looked older, and her facial features were much more angular. She wore her ponytail in a very high position until she was attacked by Miss Valentine, where a few strands of her hair were slashed off with her hair bead. It was only after her true identity was revealed that she was drawn to look more like a teenage girl, with slightly bigger/rounder facial features and a less shapely body. This was more noticeable in the anime than the manga, as the animators drew her in such a different way that she could almost be mistaken for another character. As a child, she had shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail. During the Reverse Mountain and Whisky Peak Arcs, she wears a shirt with dark blue and white circles (light blue and dark blue stripes in the anime), shorts fastened with a belt, and a white coat. During the Little Garden Arc, she wears a light green long-sleeve shirt with blue lines, white shorts, and white boots. At the beginning of the Drum Island Arc, she exchanges the shirt she wore in Little Garden for a maroon sweatshirt. Once they arrive in a cold climate zone, she begins to wear warm clothing, wearing a white coat with pink shoulder pads, long blue pants, and yellow gloves. During the Arabasta Arc, Vivi had several different outfits: During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she wears a light pink shirt with dark pink lines and figures, a white skirt, and purple high-heeled sandals. Durning the Post-War Arc, she wears a white dress. Two years later, when she attends the Levely, she wears a long-sleeved pink dress, with gold accessories at the waist and arms, a cape, red on the outside and dark blue on the inside, and white high heel pumps. When she arrived at Levely, she took off her cape. During the Egghead Arc, after being taken in by Morgans, she wears clothes lent to her by a female journalist from the World Economy News Paper, consisting of a sleeveless ruffle top, a long skirt and high-heeled sandals.", "personality": "Vivi does not fit the stereotype of a needy and authoritative princess, never demanding any special attention or prioritizing herself above others. In fact, she usually puts the needs of others far above her own and is hesitant to rely on others or ask for help with her own problems. In particular, she places an enormous value on the citizens of her country and the lives of her friends. Vivi's selfless nature could be seen especially when she asked the Straw Hats to make a detour to get medical help for Nami instead of continuing straight to Arabasta, even though she knew her country was in a state of emergency. This selflessness applies to herself as shown when in a precarious of being kidnapped by CP0 and possibly made into a slave, Vivi was more worried for her friend Shirahoshi who was being targeted by a World Noble. She is also extremely brave and determined, going up against powerful enemies for her friends' sake, even when clearly outmatched. Her selflessness and sense of responsibility push her to carry her country's burden. She is slow to anger and quick to forgive but fiercely loyal to her friends, her family, and her country. Because of this loyalty and bravery, she is willing to make virtually any sacrifice, such as when she was willing to allow her feet to be cut off to escape Mr. 3's candle prison. Vivi can stay calm in bad situation and act quickly when she sees a way out. As a member of Arabasta's royal family, she loves her country and is willing to do anything to protect it, even infiltrating a vast criminal organization. She does not mind doing tasks that seem unsuitable for a princess, such as washing dishes. Vivi grew up knowing that she was responsible for the well-being of her country. As such, she developed impressive skills as a diplomat. Even as a child, she understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years: when slapped by Wapol, she apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy to not attack the villagers and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. During arguments, Vivi has a hard time coming up with insults and usually ends up saying something of little offense. She has a habit of giving people nicknames, calling Zoro \"Mr. Bushido\", for example. She also has a habit of biting her bottom lip when she is worried. Despite her kind and earnest nature, she can be deceptive when necessary. At age fourteen, she was able to infiltrate Baroque Works and, over the course of two years, quickly rose to frontier agent status without anybody realizing her true identity. A running gag throughout much of the Arabasta Arc was that Vivi constantly forgot to warn the Straw Hats about various dangers of the desert, such as giant scorpions and lizards, until after they appeared. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji quickly dispatched any threatening creatures but berated her for her inability to remember such things beforehand. Vivi is also self-conscious about her lack of physical strength. After being nearly eaten alive by one Bananawani, she witnessed Luffy and Zoro defeated a group of them easily, causing Vivi to wail to Usopp about not being able to handle even one. After the timeskip, it is shown that her time with the Straw Hats have changed her, as Vivi's adventurous side from her times as a pirate showed itself when she was about to head to Mary Geoise for Levely. She apparently misses her time on the sea, as she felt reminiscent from the breeze from the salty ocean. She even jumped down from the mast of the ship, worrying those around her who were not with her during her time as a pirate. Vivi will not hesitate to stand up for someone whom she just befriended as she spoke out against Charlos' attempt to enslave Shirahoshi. When Neptune expressed his disgust at the World Noble's actions and went on to attack him, saying he would never bring his kind to the surface again, Vivi was brought to tears, saying that not all humans are like the World Nobles. Being fair-minded and honest person, Vivi expressed her dislike of the World Economy News Paper due to their lack of journalistic integrity, especially when the president, Morgans, falsified a story where Luffy took Vegapunk hostage while waging war against the Marines, which Vivi knew Luffy would never do.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a princess, Vivi has a great deal of authority in her country. She has a natural skill in diplomacy. This was clear even as a child, as Vivi understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years during her childhood trip to the Levely. When she was slapped by Wapol, she quickly apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When meeting the Straw Hats, she managed to persuade Zoro and Nami into protecting her from the Baroque Works agents after her cover was blown, and even persuaded Nami against charging her for their protection. When traveling with the Straw Hats, she even showed an impressive, and almost comedic amount of skill in keeping the more childish members of the crew (Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper) as well as Karoo, focused, calm, and motivated during their travels together. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers back and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. In the aftermath of the battle against Baroque Works, Vivi even managed to persuade the royal guards and rebels of her country to ultimately stop fighting and killing one another, effectively ending the needless civil war that was started by Crocodile. Vivi has proven herself to be a very capable spy and has shown great skill in stealth and other clandestine skills as well. This was proven clearly as Vivi was extremely good at moving about undetected, having established herself as a single digit member of Baroque Works for two years before her identity was compromised and she returned to Arabasta completely unnoticed by the citizens. Her actions as a spy were completely unnoticed by the Marines, the World Government, and even the Warlord of the Sea Crocodile for more than two years until her cover was finally blown by Miss All Sunday. Since leaving the Straw Hats, she seems to have managed to maintain her role as a princess, all the while successfully keeping both her past as a Baroque Works agent and a companion of a pirate crew secret from the Marines and the World Government."},

Nangi has round eyes, light skin, a wide nose, short, curly, green hair with a matching beard, and a small pair of horns on his head. On his lower body he dons an enormous tiger pelt, which in the anime is depicted as having been fashioned into a pair of shorts.", "personality": "Nangi is loyal to the Beasts Pirates, as he joined the forces that went out to confront Kaidou's attackers.

He is very loyal to Big Mom, as shown when he instantly went to attack a disturbance in Big Mom's room along with Zeus and Prometheus. He cares about Sweet City and its well-being, as he tried to stop Big Mom from destroying it in one of her craving-induced rampages. When in his blade form, Napoleon displays a more aggressive personality, threatening to bisect Jinbe and encouraging Big Mom's rampage. As with Prometheus, Napoleon sees Zeus being a liability to the crew for his constant failures and setbacks, and showed no regret at Zeus being disposed of by Linlin and Hera. However, without Big Mom, Napoleon displays a far meeker personality. While Big Mom was amnesiac, he remained quiet, only reawakening when Big Mom regained her memories, saying that the reason he did not say anything up to that point was because he was shy around strangers. Similarly, when he was attacked and separated from Big Mom by Killer, Napoleon fearfully pleaded to be left alone, claiming to just be \"a regular sword\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Being made from a fragment of Big Mom's very own soul, Napoleon is far more powerful than regular homies.

He also wore black shoes and a necklace. After the timeskip he grew a mustache, his beard had turned completely gray, andonly half of his hair was still dark. His sideburns were gray but the upper half of the back and top were black. He wore a lighter colored robe and coat and no longer wore his necklace.", "personality": "Cobra was a fair man, who cared for his kingdom and people even after their rebellion, knowing their misled coup was still only rooted in a desire to preserve the welfare of the Arabastan people. He was loyal to the line of Arabastan kings and the Dynasty, and was willing to face death to prevent Crocodile from seizing the throne. Yet, as a testament to his character, this loyalty to the monarchy is superseded by the compassion toward his subjects and he placed their survival and welfare ahead of his own, even willing to allow the occupation and possible destruction of his capital city if it meant preventing the bloodshed of his people, seeing the lives of his citizens as the true heart of his kingdom. Overall, he was objective, able to look ahead to the future and not make impulsive decisions. This was shown clearly when Koza demands that he use Dance Powder to assuage the difficulties of the current drought, and Cobra explained that other countries need rain and hoarding it themselves is not a true solution. He still remained humble, and he even bowed before the Straw Hats in the bathhouse for helping his daughter, justifying it by saying that without his clothes, he did not have his status as a king, and was doing it as a father. In addition, he was charitable, paying to support the citizens of Koza's village out of the royal family's living expenses without hesitation. Like most of the bearers of the Will of D., Cobra isnt afraid of death as he was ready to give his life to protect Sabo and pass the legacy of D. He tried to raise his daughter humbly and somewhat as a normal child, as he was not overly upset whenanother childgot into a physical fight with Vivi, as well as letting Vivi simply refer to him as \"dad\". He let Vivi have a lot of freedom as a child and play with commoner children. However, he still worried a lot about her and often sneaked after her to check if she was doing okay. Like most fathers, he also wanted what he thinks is best for his daughter and tried to persuade Vivi into finding a husband before he passed away from his illness, but Cobra's words fell on deaf ears as Vivi told him to send the suitors away, still wishing to remain a free spirit like the Straw Hats. Vivi also berated her father on using his illness as an excuse for her to marry. He also appeared to have a mischievous side, telling the Straw Hats where the women's baths were so they could peep at Nami and his daughter.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king of Arabasta, a member of the World Government, Cobra had full authority over his subjects and was allowed to attend the Levely. In addition to his royal authority over all of Arabasta's troops, Cobra was a reasonably athletic man in his youth, enough to help Igaram fight members of Agotogi's gang hand-to-hand. Though apparently lacking any formal combat training, he even exercised a \"technique\" known as the King Chop (, Kingu Choppu?) on subjects who annoyed him, up to and including his own ministers. By the time of Operation Utopia, he had become infirm enough to be easily manhandled by Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas (as well as Miss All-Sunday). At the same time, he still possessed enough stamina to survive being crucified through the elbows for several hours.

{"name": "Nico Robin", "episode": "Episode 114", "chapter": "Chapter 67", "year": 1999, "note": "Her real name was revealed by Crocodile in Chapter 177.", "appearance": "Nico Robin is a tall, slender young woman with shoulder-length black hair and eyes that have dark, wide pupils (her eyes are depicted to be brown in the manga as well as the tenth and twelfth movies; while in the anime, her eyes are depicted to be blue cerulean). She also has a long, thin, and defined nose. In the anime, Robin's skin tone has a slightly darker tan unlike in manga-colored artworks where it is lighter. Robin also resembles her mother greatly, with the exception of her hair color and style as well as having a slightly darker skin tone than her. Robin's limbs are very long, especially her legs, contributing greatly to both her fighting capabilities (given the nature of her powers) and overall height.", "abilities_and_powers": "At a young age, Robin acquired a bounty of 79,000,000 for having the ability to read Poneglyphs, which told of the Void Century. Her ability to read the Poneglyphs is by far her most dangerous quality, and the World Government considers her a huge threat because of this. This has also made her a vital target for those who understand the significance of the Poneglyphs, mainly for those who want to gain control of the Ancient Weapons and/or the means to find Laugh Tale, including Crocodile of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Kaidou and Big Mom of the Four Emperors and the Five Elders of the World Government. She was branded as being considerably powerful, and supposedly sinking six Buster Call warships with her Devil Fruit powers. This was all a lie fabricated by the government: those ships were actually destroyed by Jaguar D. Saul while helping Robin escape the destruction of Ohara. Due to her having to spend her life on the run from multiple organizations, mostly the Marines and the World Government, Robin had developed into a strong and resourceful woman. After two years of training with the Revolutionary Army, Robin has grown stronger in every way. Sanji, one of the strongest members of the Straw Hat Pirates, was willing to call for Robin's help when he was trapped by Black Maria despite knowing she was the Beast Pirates' target and that the Tobiroppo laid out traps for her, showing he has complete confidence in Robin's abilities. His faith was proven to be well-placed when Robin defeated Black Maria. After the Raid on Onigashima, Robin's bounty was increased to 930,000,000, the fifth highest among the crew, making her one of the most dangerous members of the Straw Hat Pirates in the eyes of the World Government.", "personality": "Out of all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates, Robin is the most serene and has rarely been seen to act comically.She approaches life and the world at large in a calm and collected manner and is overall one of the least emotional members of the crew. She treats Luffy with more respect than the most of the crew,even when he acts impulsively, to the point where she will smile and laugh at his antics rather than berate him.Together withZoro, she is one of the members that support Luffy's decisions unconditionally. When the crew is sailing, Robin is usually reading andinvestigating data from the places they visit.She is very wise and very patient in everything.Robin does not play a specific role in the ship, but she can foresee what can be found somewhere and that (in her own words), is of advantage to others.Luffy considers her a very intelligent member. Through her heritage on the island of scholars, Robin is an archaeologist and historian who seeks the comfort and freedom to study the mysteries of the world. She is the quieter, more reserved crew member, rarely having outbursts of emotions (occasional exceptions being sweat drops, and when she cried out to Luffy and the Straw Hats from the Tower of Justice during the Enies Lobby Arc). She even appears calm while speaking ominously around her crewmates. She has an \"adult charm\" about her, as stated by Sanji. Being described as the \"mother\" by Oda, she in kind has shown maternal care for younger characters like Chopper, Momonosuke, and Toko. Being an archeologist, Robin is highly passionate about the world's history and uncovering the mysteries of its past. As such, she does not tolerate people who regard history as meaningless or destroy objects of historical significance. She became furious at Yama because he destroyed valuable artifacts from Shandora, and swiftly defeated him after. She shows little interest in the Ancient Weapons that individuals such as Crocodile and Spandam seek. However, she might be the only one who is able to awaken them."},

{"name": "Nami", "episode": "Episode 8", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "Her name was revealed in Chapter 9.", "appearance": "Nami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Many characters seem to consider her to be an attractive woman.[citation needed] She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mre, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew. Her overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature four-letter words, such as \"Gold\" or \"EVIL\", similar to a shirt that Bell-mre once wore that had \"MACE\" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by her sister, Nojiko. After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head may form into a messy cowlick. She wears a strap around her thigh with three slots in it which she keeps each pole of her bo staff and later the Clima-Tact in.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being the assigned navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami is responsible for evaluating the direction that the ship goes as they sail further into the sea. Nami also tends to act as the crew's de facto treasurer, managing the crew's money and allocating spending money whenever they arrive at a new location. Nami is an accomplished and agile polearm user. Knowing she lacks the raw strength of most of her crewmembers she uses her cunning and specially designed weapons to combat opponents who are her physical superiors. While she tries to avoid combat as much as possible, when the need arises Nami gives her all in battle and has defeated some fearsome fighters. Despite being one of the weakest members of the crew, Nami nonetheless possesses a strong enough will to be able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki just like the rest of her crewmates.", "personality": "Along with Nico Robin, Usopp, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, and Franky, Nami is one of the smartest of the Straw Hats. And according to an SBS from volume 8 (1999), Oda said that \"of all the characters introduced so far in One Piece\" Nami was the third smartest character in the East Blue (the first is Benn Beckman of the Red Hair Pirates, the 2nd being Captain Kuro). Though given how few characters were introduced and properly developed at that time, that quote should be taken with a grain of salt. At the beginning of the series, Nami despised all pirates. She viewed them as universally evil after losing someone close to her to pirates, only changing her mind after she met Luffy (although Nami still reminds Luffy that not all pirates are like him). Before her view on pirates changed, she was perfectly fine with giving a captive Luffy up to Buggy but refused to kill him when asked by Buggy to do so, as she could not bring herself to stoop to their level. Nami has been deeply affected by her adoptive mother's death and Arlong's enslavement and imprisonment of her. She remembers vividly of the abuse she suffered such as one of Arlong's crewmates refusing to feed her as well as the pain and exhaustion on the streets from stealing money in an attempt to buy back the village from Arlong. Upon failing to do so, Nami was utterly distraught and when Genzo and rest of the villages went to die for her, Nami took the knife she was holding and madly stabbed her shoulder before Luffy stopped her. Her experiences left Nami with many painful memories, that she has since then successfully buried but Nami still retained a fear and distrust of the Fish-Men race as a whole until she learned the painful history of human cruelty towards Fish-Men. By the time the crew reached Fish-Man Island, she was willing to give Fish-Men a chance and even befriends some of them while claiming she solely held a grudge against Arlong. Nami is also disbelieving in myths and legends, as she dismissed Devil Fruits as myths, disbelieved the existence of Skypiea, and was dubious over claims of a connection between Sanji and the \"mythical evil army\", Germa 66. Ironically, all these legends were proven true to her when she saw Buggy's Bara Bara no Mi in action, when Robin insisted that the Log Pose pointing at Skypiea was proof of its existence, and when Pekoms confirmed Germa and Sanji's history together. Nami was shocked to see and hear that she was wrong but slowly accepted the unbelievable things in front of her. Nami can be seen ordering the crew to lift the mast or draw the sails. If she deems an island dangerous, she will often try to convince Luffy (usually along with Usopp and Chopper) to not go there but will nonetheless follow Luffy's orders when he demands so. She seems like a coward, but she has been referred to by multiple people being a \"bold woman.\" Usually, she is called that when she stands up for her crew and what she believes to be right. She is aware of the dangers they face every day and has a much better understanding of the world and its more dangerous individuals (e.g., the Seven Warlords of the Sea) than most of her crew does, though lacks Robin's knowledge on some of its other powerful figures (e.g., the Marine Admirals) and organizations (e.g., the Four Emperors). She can be devilish and cunning at times, and if she feels like it will even give her fights to Luffy, Zoro or Sanji. She is the only one among the crew to be visibly concerned and upset whenever their bounties go up, something the others usually react to with indifference or even joy. After the two-year timeskip, she now appears calmer in more daunting situations, most notably when the fake Nami held a gun to her head, implying she has become fairly confident in her abilities. It seems this confidence is paradoxical however, as Nami herself states she isn't weak, but she is a \"scaredy-cat\". True to her word, she and Usopp became extremely confident they could take down Baby 5 and Buffalo, once the threat of their retaliation was no longer a factor. Nami is still prone to panic in the face of imminent danger (shown during the descent to Fish-Man Island and Sanji's declaration that he would counterattack the Big Mom ship), and her love of money causes her to resort to her old antics of hitting the male crew members. She still has an extremely high tolerance for alcohol during celebrations. As shown in Jaya, Nami appears to be terrified of bugs and spiders. She screamed and panicked when Usopp pointed out a tarantula crawling up her back and remained scared for the rest of the hunt for the South Bird as more insects emerged. This phobia was shown again in an anime filler scene in the Whole Cake Island Arc where the Sanji Retrieval Team battled against the giant ants. While the rest of the team fought the creatures, Nami elected to just run away from them, saying she could not stand it. From time to time, Nami enjoys casual and leisurely activities, and the most common of these is reclining in a deck chair, often to sunbathe, read, or relax under the shade of a parasol umbrella. Nami sometimes sits in her chair after taking a swim in the Thousand Sunny's pool. In fact, the pictures for her wanted posters were taken while she posed next to pools. While she is in her deck chair, she may be accompanied by Robin or presented a refreshing snack or drink by Sanji, but she does not take kindly to the rest of the crew's rambunctious antics on the ship, which tend to disturb her as she relaxes. She will also not hesitate to strip down or outright discard pieces of an outfit if it is hindering her in times of danger, such as ripping the hem of her already ruined dancer's dress to flee from Zala, pulling off her shirt to dive into a Milky Road, and wriggling out of her denim jacket after Kumadori had pinned her down by her denim jacket and was about to strike her with a deadly blow. Nami has shown dismay at clothes she is particularly fond of being ruined, angrily striking Luffy when she saw her jacket torn up when she lent it to him in the Drum Island Arc. Likewise, she will even tear apart someone else's clothes if she has to, not hesitating to shred an unconscious Kalifa's clothes after their battle to find a potential key to Robin's Seastone cuffs in the Enies Lobby Arc. In the Whole Cake Island Arc, when her clothes were burned off by Jinbe, Nami wasted no time stripping a nearby prisoner of his clothes. Nami is also willing to borrow other people's clothes, such as borrowing Sanji's jacket to wear at the end of the Little Garden Arc after Usopp's plan to save her, Vivi, and Zoro had burned her shirt, leaving her with a black bra on, until she could get a replacement shirt after returning to the Going Merry. Nami is easily surprised and shocked by the more outlandish things in the series, yelling at the crew when they don't seem as concerned as her. Nami even expressed shock at a talking, clothed crocodile, despite traveling around with Chopper and Carrot from the Mink Tribe as Luffy pointed out and said she should be used to things by now. "},

In fact, whenever a big scoop would pop up, he would retain his calm and composure just to get it, despite the chaos and danger the opportunity presents. As the President of the World Economy News Paper, Morgans takes utmost pride in his occupation as a journalist and does not tolerate being called otherwise. He is even willing to risk his life on occasion just to take pictures of a newsworthy event. He is not even afraid of incurring an Emperor's wrath upon himself, as seen when he intentionally wrote an article of Big Mom's defeat, knowing full well what consequences that action could do to him. While claiming that he has deep connections with the Germa, he showed no caring concerns for their well-being, as when the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treacherous plot to obliterate Germa's ruling family, Morgans simply found the turn of events to be exciting. He has proven to be an unscrupulous individual, as when Big Mom was dealing with her enemies, Morgans tried to peek into the contents of the Tamatebako and was caught eavesdropping on the events with Du Feld and Stussy. He agreed to create a fake story to cover Stussy's tracks in exchange for seeing the famous sea treasure. He can also be prone to letting his personal biases influence his news stories, as his respect and admiration for Luffy caused him to exaggerate the pirate's accomplishments against Big Mom. Morgans is shown to not care whether anything he publishes in the newspaper is true or not and considers the newspaper a form of entertainment. Morgans has a soft spot for beautiful women, as he was completely captivated by Shirahoshi. This may apply to Vivi as well, as despite the extremely dangerous situation that unfolded at the Levely, Morgans took her in to hide her from the World Government. Morgans has demonstrated impartiality and a commitment to pursuing captivating news stories, regardless of their origin. This was evident when he chose to take in Wapol and Vivi, not out of concern, but just because he was sorely interested in the fact why the two are seeking asylum. Whether he did this out of the goodness of his heart or for his own personal gain, or some mixture of both, remains to be seen. Occasionally, Morgans may incorporate false information and fabrications into his articles to enhance reader engagement. He has a distinct laugh: \"Kuwahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Morgans is in charge of the World Economy News Paper, giving him control over the newspaper and the information it gives to people. He has access to information not available to most people, as demonstrated by his knowledge of Big Mom's recent acquisition of the Tamatebako and of her Soul Pocus technique. Furthermore, as a boss of the Underworld, Morgans has a high degree of power within it. His importance is recognized by Emperor Big Mom, who invited him to a Tea Party. He also has deep bonds with the Germa, and his newspaper incidentally publishes a popular comic strip that features their army as its main antagonists. Morgans does not fight often, but he has considerable combat skills, beating a Cipher Pol agent within seconds. He also possesses great willpower, withstanding a blast of Haoshoku Haki from Big Mom."},

As his epithet suggests, his right hand has been replaced with a huge steel axe, the handle of which is not only bolted through the bones of his forearm, but sticks out where his elbow should be. Like most Marine officers, he wears a large, ornate overcoat. However, this coat notably lacks the usual \"Justice\" (?) insignia, and is completely sleeveless; it is also worn conventionally, instead of being draped over the shoulders like a cape. His trousers bear a striped pattern reminiscent of Marine Bases and battleships. In peacetime, he can often be seen smoking a cigar. As a no-name Marine, Morgan had a cleft chin similar to his sons (though this apparently developed after his youth), and his arms were both whole and a little less muscular, though he still seemed very well-built. During the attack by Captain Kuro, his arm was maimed and his chin shattered, necessitating his future prosthetics. He wore a standard Marine uniform, which was slashed across the front by Kuros signature Cat Claws. After his defeat and arrest, Morgan was put into a standard striped prisoner's uniform, and shackled around the arms and legs. While he eventually rid himself of the shackles, the prisoner's uniform has remained his last known outfit to date.", "personality": "In his youth, Morgan was a brave, tenacious Marine, willing to defy enemies even on the brink of death. In time, however, his success corrupted him until he became a brutal tyrant obsessed with his personal status and glory above all. As such, Morgan's usual demeanor is similar to that of many pirates: ruling chiefly through terror, quick to threaten execution for the slightest defiance, and utterly convinced of his own infallibility. Such is his narcissism that he considered a statue of himself (funded by taxes coerced from Shells Town's citizens) one of his greatest accomplishments. Following his defeat and arrest, Morgan also displayed enough cunning to successfully escape custody. What motives or goals he may have adopted since are unknown. However, he became lax enough to take a nap while sailing away.", "abilities_and_powers": "Even as a recruit, Morgan was notably tougher than average, surviving an onslaught from Captain Kuro that instantly killed dozens of other Marines (though it should be noted that not finishing him was a deliberate choice on Kuro's part). As Captain of the 153rd, Morgan possessed notably more muscle and bulk, enough to easily lift an average-sized man by the neck, as well as complete authority over an entire base of Marine swordsmen and riflemen. While he lost this authority after his arrest, he still maintained enough strength to burst a set of metal shackles from the inside-out. He also possesses some knowledge of Devil Fruits despite their rarity in the East Blue, immediately identifying them as the source of Monkey D. Luffy's rubber body."},

Cricket also shows compassion to the Saruyama Alliance, viewing the two captains as his surrogate sons and jumping to their defense against Bellamy. Cricket was carrying a burden about his ancestor Noland, as he was labeled as a liar and was ridiculed by many because of his relation to Noland which resulted him in setting sail as a pirate. When he came across Jaya by chance, the island that Noland supposedly found the city of gold and the island that so many of Cricket's family members failed in finding, he decided to search for it believing it was fate and stated he is not doing it to clear Noland's name but just fulfilling what he believes is his destiny. Eventually, once he discovered that what his ancestor stated about the city of gold existing was true and the story about him was false, He found peace with his ancestor's legacy and move on to continue onto new dreams.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Saruyama Alliance, Cricket commands two large pirate crews through his proteges, Masira and Shoujou."},

While Noland had tanned skin, Cricket is very pale; while he had brown hair, Cricket is blonde; and while Noland had a roundish nose and pleasant face, Cricket has a small pointed nose and a longish face. His legs were covered by striped blue and white pants, and his feet by standard shoes. Hidden under his coat, he had an orange sash adorned with medal-like pendants. He carried around his sword, a katana with a chestnut-shaped handguard and orange and white hilt-bandaging, on his left hip, in an orange scabbard with a green band on it. On the left side of his chest is a large cross-shaped scar. After his execution, Noland's image was distorted over the years due to the shame that was brought to his name. Since then, whenever someone refers to Noland, the image of an ever smiling idiot is the one that commonly comes into mind. This defacing image is the one often drawn by artists in children's books. His nose is shaped like a spork.", "personality": "The Noland who is depicted in the stories is a grinning fool who often went away on long expeditions only to return with stories that seemed unbelievable.

While lesser sailors would not return or be completely traumatized by even a single trip, Noland and his crew were able to return safely each time. He was also a skilled botanist and doctor, almost single-handedly curing the Shandia village of the tree plague.

{"name": "Monkey D. Garp", "episode": "Episode 92", "chapter": "Chapter 68", "year": 1999, "note": "He is formally introduced in Chapter 432.", "appearance": "Garp is a tall, tanned, broad-chested, muscular old man. He has a beard and a scar over his left eye. In the anime, his eye color is blue, and his hair is gray, whereas in the manga, it is white. Garp and Tsuru are the only two vice admirals to have special shoulder-pads; Garp is golden and blue (black and red in the anime) while Tsuru is purple with white dot whereas the standard color is blue and red. During the Battle of Edd War, Garp's had two black stripes on his epaulettes, and during his appearance at Water 7, it increased to three stripes and by the time of the Marineford War, it increased again to four stripes. The dog mask that Garp initially wore when introduced served to hide his identity as Luffy's grandfather, whose design had appeared in Romance Dawn, Version 2. After their relationship was revealed in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Garp is no longer seen wearing the mask. In his free time or vacation, Garp often wears sandals, a red tropical shirt and light-colored shorts. He sometimes pairs this shirt with black trousers and boots. When visiting Dadan during Luffy's childhood, he sometimes wears his official black suit without wearing his Marine cape. Thirty-eight years ago, Garp's hair was all black and lacked a goatee. He wore a white dress shirt and a red tie. Thirty years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were all black. He wore a dark suit with an orange striped undershirt and a black tie. Twenty-four years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were still black, with sideburns beginning to whiten. He wore a dark double-breasted suit with a white shirt and a red tie. When he was a child and a young man, Garp resembled Luffy, though more muscular than his grandson. As a child, he had light brown hair, wore a tropical button shirt with shorts, and wielded a pipe staff. Garp already had the scar on his left eye in his childhood days. After the timeskip, his appearance has somewhat remained the same though he now wears a dark-colored suit (still white in the anime).", "personality": "Garp is an eccentric but caring man, who is loyal to both his criminal family and the Marine Headquarters, who he has served for decades. He is loud, boisterous, exuberant, and overall acts in a similar manner to his grandson. He has a habit of falling asleep during conversations and can be absent-minded. Luffy's crew noted his apparently hereditary selfishness during Garp's interaction with Luffy in Water 7. Unlike many Marines, Garp does not believe that a person's lineage determines their path. On a similar note, he does not believe that being labeled a criminal necessarily makes someone a bad person. Although Garp wanted his grandsons to become marines, he entrusted their care to a mountain bandit whom he had refused to turn over for prosecution. Garp believes that throwing children into harsh conditions will ultimately make them strong, and has no problem striking children to drive home a point. Despite this, Garp is a supportive person. When Ace asked Garp whether he should have been born, Garp replies that Ace will find the answer if he continues living. When Momousagi mentioned Luffy being targeted by two Emperors, Garp did not express much concern about it. Although Garp will ultimately comply with Marine HQ's most serious orders, he highly values his freedom and family. Often to a point where he bends the rules to accommodate these values. He initially refused to capture Luffy in Water 7 until explicitly ordered to do so. Despite fulfilling his duties, Garp has a Moral Code to follow, which according to Sengoku is the main reason why Garp refused the promotion as an Admiral multiple times, as his code dictates that it is not his duty to protect Celestial Dragons. Additionally, Garp is generally amused by Luffy's exploits as a pirate, and only seriously laments both of his grandsons' choices to become pirates after Ace is captured. He ultimately allowed Luffy to hit him due to valuing his family more than his duty as a Marine during the war at Marineford. He even seemed ready to defend them when Akainu executed Ace and was on the verge of killing Luffy. Like Luffy, Garp is extremely blunt and honest when talking to people as seen when he openly badmouthed Sterry, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, unafraid of the consequences. He considers the Celestial Dragons scumbags and is not afraid of expressing this vocally. The main reason he refused to become an admiral is because he does not want to be their direct subordinate. On one occasion, he also blurted out Monkey D. Dragon's name in front of Luffy, his friends, and his subordinates without any consideration at Water 7. When he realized he should not have said that he just simply laughed it off, asking those who heard to forget about it. Garp believes in the potential of youth and sees it as a Marine's duty to protect the future. This is the first lesson he teaches to Marine recruits, even telling them in a situation where they have to choose between saving a old man and a baby; they should leave the old man behind on the dangerous island and save the baby because the old man doesn't have much time left while the baby and them have a whole future ahead of them. While his fellow Marine instructor told him never to repeat this lesson, Garp stood by it. He would display his commitment to this by launching a rescue mission to save Koby after he was taken to Hachinosu by Blackbeard, declaring Koby the future of the Marines. At the end of the raid, he showed his faith in Koby, Prince Grus and Helmeppo by entrusting them to save the Marine ship from Avalo Pizarro's attack while he stayed behind to allow to them to escape, calling all of them the \"future of the Marines\". When Garp prepares to fight seriously, he often removes his Marine coat or a suit jacket. Like his grandson, Garp is extremely fond of food, especially donuts, rice crackers and meat. Garp has his own laughter style: Bwahaha or Wahaha.", "abilities_and_powers": "Garp is considered a living legend and is one of the strongest marines of all time. In his heyday he was famous for cornering Gol D. Roger many times, as he was one of the very few people capable of fighting the Pirate King. In fact, Roger states that he and Garp had almost killed each other many times throughout their battles. Due to his incredible power and popularity, Garp was offered the rank of admiral several times throughout his life but refused the promotion every time. As a testament to his strength, together with Roger he fought and defeated the Rocks Pirates, one of the strongest pirate crews in history that featured Roger's most formidable rival, Rocks D. Xebec; three future Emperors, Edward Newgate, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou; and other legendary pirates such as Shiki the Golden Lion. This tremendous feat earned Garp the title of Hero of the Marines. His power and reputation are so immense, that Cross Guild has given him a bounty of 3,000,000,000, the same bounty as an Admiral. As another testament to his sheer power, Garp defeated and nearly killed Don Chinjao in the past with a single punch, whose bounty was worth 542,000,000 in his prime and was said to be able to split a continent with a headbutt, this earned him the epithet, Garp the Fist. Chinjao himself said that during that time, all the pirates saw Garp as a \"Devil\" to them. Even at the ripe age of 76, he was shown to be able to easily strike down Marco the Phoenix, Whitebeard's right hand, which was something that both Kizaru and Akainu seemed unable to do. In fact, during the War after Ace's death, Akainu would possibly have been killed by a furious Garp had Sengoku not restrained him. Whereas it took Akainu 10 days to barely defeat Aokiji, Garp was able to easily overpower the latter in moments. During the raid on Hachinosu, he battled his former student, Kuzan, and the other Titanic Captains present thereSanjuan Wolf, Shiryu, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shotall at once and more than hold his own before he was ultimately overwhelmed. Although, this was after the Marines completed their mission to recuse Koby and Garp chose to stay behind to cover their escape. Similarly, when it was revealed worldwide that Luffy is Garp's grandson, Luffy's fame rose based on that fact, as Demaro Black attempted to use that as one of the strong points in his impersonation of Luffy. Charlotte Linlin referenced Garp when Luffy challenged her. He has merits and influence great enough to make even the World Nobles do not dare to get rid of him despite his rebellious personality. Jaygarcia Saturn of the Five Elders remarked how Luffy's record is understandable, being Garp's grandson."},

Luffy", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his nickname \"Straw Hat Luffy\"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. He wears blue shorts with cuffs, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Four Emperors, and at the young age of 19, Luffy is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, holding the greatest authority over a mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous members, many of whom are extremely powerful in their own right. Luffy has a tremendous amount of influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with their lives, despite his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it. He is also one of twelve pirates who have been dubbed as the \"Worst Generation\", a group of individuals who have become infamous for the bold and major actions they have committed against the World Government, and all have bounties of over 100,000,000. Indirectly, he also has claim over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, a massive fleet consisting of seven powerful New World crews numbering 5640 people in total, who all swore to serve under him of their own will and come to assist him whenever he may need them. The scope of Luffy's authority was considered by the World Government to be close to on par with the Four Emperors, the four most powerful and influential pirates in the world, and the press dubbed Luffy the \"Fifth Emperor\" as a result. However, Luffy officially became an Emperor after defeating one of the previous Emperors, Kaidou, and his meteoric rise in status (in over two years) caused panic around the world; he currently holds a bounty of 3,000,000,000, which is currently the lowest Emperor bounty and equals the bounties of two of his fellow Worst Generation membersKid and Law. His bounty is only surpassed by the bounties of the former Emperors Whitebeard, Big Mom, Kaidou, fellow Emperors Shanks, Blackbeard and Buggy, former Warlord Mihawk and the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger himself. Luffy is a fierce and formidable combatant who can invent extremely creative fighting techniques even during intense battles and has gone through harsh and rigorous training ever since he was a child. He has been taught by two legendary figures, his grandfather Monkey D. Garp, the \"Hero of the Marines\", and Silvers Rayleigh, the retired first mate of the Pirate King's crew. Despite acting goofy and eccentric most of the time, Luffy has proven to be a natural born leader. Luffy has exhibited his threat most notably by invading all three of the World Government's main strongholds in Paradise: he defeated over a thousand Marines on Enies Lobby by himself and took down two CP9 agentsBlueno, and Rob Lucci, with the invasion ultimately resulting in the destruction of Enies Lobby via Buster Call; he infiltrated the great prison Impel Down and orchestrated the only mass breakout in its history; he invaded Marine Headquarters during the Summit War of Marineford and greatly aided the Whitebeard Pirates in their ultimately unsuccessful effort to rescue Portgas D. Ace from execution. One of Luffy's greatest qualities is that he can become massively more powerful in an unthinkably short amount of time. To the amazement of friend and foe alike, Luffy has continuously defeated people who are renowned throughout the seas for their incredible strength and skill. Luffy has also significantly threatened the balance of the Three Great Powers by defeating three members of the Seven Warlords of the SeaCrocodile, Gecko Moria, Donquixote Doflamingoand allying with three others, which caused Jinbe to defect from his position and Trafalgar Law to lose his. The World Government also views Luffy to be a grave threat simply because he is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army. Despite his ever-growing list of accomplishments in battle, Luffy continues to be frequently underestimated by opponents due to his appearance, age and disposition. These traits have often proved to be an advantage for him, as it gives him leeway toward options opponents would not expect. For example, Crocodile dismissed Luffy as a greenhorn and left him for dead twice, only for Luffy to recover from his defeats and ultimately claim victory in their third match. Donquixote Doflamingo attempted to trap Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum, expecting him to fall victim to it, only for Luffy to escape and win over the gladiators there to his side. With constantly improving skill in battle combined with his almost unbreakable willpower, Luffy has found ways to defeat increasingly powerful opponents that have blocked his path, all while having been out at sea for less than a year, not including his two-year training on Rusukaina. In the New World, he has contended with the Four Emperors' top officers, having defeated two of the Big Mom Pirates' Sweet Commanders: Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri, seeking to aim further by taking down the Four Emperors themselves, along with the Marine Admirals. During the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy's recently heightened mastery of advanced Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki allowed him to fight on par with Kaidou of the Four Emperors before awakening his Devil Fruit's true power upon suffering a third defeat from a finishing blow, which finally allowed him to emerge victorious against Kaidou in one-on-one combat.", "personality": "Luffy's most dominant traits are his apparent lack of common sense, his utter fearlessness and unwavering belief in himself. He generally marches at the beat of his own drum, unwilling to approach anything in a delicate or nuanced matter. That said, Luffy has a penchant of being able to see through the heart of the matter, often able to accurately call out someone's personal flaws such as Koby's cowardly nature or Kuro's weakness as a pirate. He is profoundly ambitious, frequently declaring he will become the Pirate King and devoting his entire being into being one. Luffy's personality can be described as childlike, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes. He can either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure; or extraordinarily selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect his friends, crew, and family. This childish mentality does not prevent him from often getting to the root of the problem and allowing him to figure out the simplest way of solving it. Shanks has had a profound effect on Luffy's personality, as prior to meeting him, Luffy was arrogant, impatient and extremely prideful. The thought of Shanks being humiliated by Higuma infuriated the young boy, and he recklessly tried to get his revenge. After meeting Shanks and being inspired to become the Pirate King, Luffy eventually grows up to become more like him - opting to become calmer, patient, and avoid letting things get to him. Early on, he would occasionally repeat some of Shanks' lines to other people, like during his first meeting with Usopp. With that said, Luffy is very much his own person and fairly different from Shanks overall. On occasion, he will still lose his cool and get angry, though this aspect of him has lessened considerably since the timeskip. Above all else, Luffy dislikes weak people, though not strictly in a physical sense. He has openly told Koby that he \"hates people like him\" due to Koby's frequent use of phrases of \"it's impossible\" and his cowardly nature. Conversely, he likes people who put in the effort to make something of themselves, despite their limitations, and has come to appreciate Koby after seeing him put his life on the line. He calls out Kuro for complaining about being a pirate, taking less issue with his crimes and more with his desire to escape the life of being a pirate. Luffy frequently expresses wonder of the simplest things, such as hermit crabs, and can be confused by concepts such as that by digging a hole right next to another he may be unintentionally filling the other hole. In addition, during long and complex explanations of something, he immediately calls it magic. He likes monsters and will ask weird creatures to join his crew (as seen in the Thriller Bark Arc, asking a talking tree to join his crew). He has an appalling lack of knowledge for medicine: when Nami had a high fever, he told her to eat cold food and later tried to make Roronoa Zoro better (after battling Bartholomew Kuma) by pouring sake onto him, because Zoro likes sake. When attempting to think up a plan to get off of Amazon Lily, whilst he managed to make some logical sense of where to look, he is seen to strain himself and noted that he is going to feel sick from too much thinking. He is rarely disturbed by violence and bloodshed, as he has fought his whole life. Even the worst battlefields rarely disturb him, except when it involves a friend or relative, as in the case of Ace. Despite his reckless and energetic disposition, Luffy also has a penchant for silent reactions in general. He is seemingly unfazed by the most horrifying sights, such as pirates dying before him, headless men left after Law's attacks or the extreme violence from various devil fruit users in general. He almost never gets irritated with normal people, though there are a few exceptions. Luffy gets irritated at people who have different tastes in food as him, and dislikes it when people try to look at his \"privates.\" He also doesn't seem to like it when people play and stretch with his rubber body while he eats but doesn't have much of an issue with it otherwise. On a more serious note, he is actively annoyed at people who tell him things are \"impossible\" and will even hit people (men or women) who push the issue too far. People who betray their comrades outright disgust him, regardless of how awful said comrades might be. His irritation can extend to his crewmates too, particularly when they whine about the dangers, he tends to put them in, or when they go too far, such as his clash with Usopp. Luffy calls every mixed-appearance creature he finds by whichever creature is its secondary (non-dominant) part. On Gaimon's island, the dog/chicken was referred to as a \"chicken\" when it was mostly a dog, the snake/rabbit a \"rabbit\" even though it was mostly snake, and the pig/lion a \"lion\" even though it was mostly pig. This becomes a running gag: later when he meets Bananawani, he calls them \"bananas with crocodiles attached to them.\" Also, after seeing Pierre transform, he continued to refer to him as a \"horse\" instead of a bird. And related to this running gag, when on Long Ring Long Land island, he called every animal by what he thought they resembled, rather than the actual species they were. Luffy is enthralled by all aspects of pirate life. He was extremely happy when the Straw Hats got their first ship and was ecstatic at the idea of firing cannon balls at rock formations. Luffy likes to sit on the bow of the ship, such as the heads of the Going Merry and the Thousand Sunny, the nose of Rocketman, the head of the right Yuda of the Kuja Pirates' ship or even on top of the front cannon of a captured Marines' ship. Luffy's interest in women is nuanced: Luffy was aroused when Nami stripped yet remained neutral when Hancock did so. In the former case, it was because he was with Usopp at the time, and Usopp (who is someone he shares a close connection to due to their similar age and interests) was clearly a bad influence on his behavior. In general, he has not yet displayed any romantic inclinations or perversions, having nonchalantly refused to marry Lola and Hancock without a second thought. Luffy also has an indifferent behavior towards marriage. While he knows what marriage is, he does not seem to care about the significance of it, as when Sanji was in an arranged marriage with Pudding, he didn't care if he got married and cared more about him returning to the crew. He also did not object to Absalom trying to marry Nami and only commented on how \"brave\" he was to want to marry her. Despite his general disinterest, Luffy has earned the affections of many women along his travels (such as Alvida's admiration, the love of Boa Hancock, etc.), quite a few of whom are royalty.[citation needed] Luffy has shown to admire heroic figures, though he has stated vehemently that he doesn't want to be one, with his primary hang up being that heroes are fundamentally entirely selfless, and Luffy not really identifying that trait. Ironically, many of Luffy's actions are immensely selfless, with his selfishness mainly revolving around his gluttony and his thirst for adventure. This trait leaves everyone he meets with to think he is some kind of hero, but not by his own design. Eventually, he warms up to the idea of being a hero for Fish-Man Island by Jinbe in exchange for receiving lots of meat. Luffy is anextremely heavy sleeper. During the operation to ruin Sanji and Pudding's wedding ceremony, Jinbe could not wake him up even after smacking him several times and yelling directly into his ears. Only after he was presented meat - his favorite food - did he finally wake up. Back at Water 7, Luffy woke up when his grandfather Garp hit him with his \"Fist of Love.\" Luffy has gained a reputation of being a very dangerous person because of his recklessness and even insanity. However, unlike other pirates who have a reputation for being psychotic (like the Killer of the Marines Caribou or Bellamy) due to their unjust violence against civilians or authorities, Luffy gained his reputation for helping his friends and innocents in the face of unjust or evil figures, usually going above and beyond to save them. This often puts him at odds with powerful organizations and pirates of incredible influence and power. When his adoptive older brother, Ace, was killed at Marineford, the mental strain of watching Ace die in his arms caused him to fall into a catatonic state. After waking from this state, Luffy flew into a rage and went on a destructive rampage to vent his grief and anger, in a way that was deeply uncharacteristic of his usual self. Luffy came to the conclusion that he had been too nave, and was weak and unworthy of becoming Pirate King, falling into a state of depression and self-pity. Some encouragement from Jinbe and Rayleigh gave Luffy some renewed courage to continue pursuing his dream, as well as realize that while he may have lost Ace, he still had his precious crew. After the timeskip, he tells Rayleigh that he will be Pirate King, having regained his confidence to fight for his dream. Throughout the series, several characters have stated similarities between Luffy and other D. carriers, whether in personality, words, actions, or presence. So far he is thought to be similar to Jaguar D. Saul by Robin; to Monkey D. Garp by Aokiji, by at least one of the Five Elders, and by his own crew; to Monkey D. Dragon by Emporio Ivankov; to Gol D. Roger by Smoker, Crocus, Kureha, Gan Fall, Shanks, Rayleigh, Kokoro, Shakuyaku and the non-canonical Raoul; and to Portgas D. Ace by Tama and Yamato."},

His horns are also bigger.", "personality": "Merry is a dutiful butler who sees his mistress' well-being the top priority. It was for this reason that he previously saw Usopp as an untrustworthy and negative influence on Kaya, and even threatened him with a gun while declaring him a criminal. Merry is also friendly and loyal with his fellow colleagues whom he trusts, as he was cordial and jovial with Klahadore when regarding Usopp's claim about former being a pirate as ridiculous, while happy with tears when Klahadore found the present that Kaya had prepared for him, considering their mistress' thoughtfulness and perceptiveness. However, when Klahadore revealed his true colors as the pirate Kuro, Merry realized his mistake and affirmed his loyalty to Kaya by screaming for her to run for her life. He was logical to understand that the household was not the only ones in danger, thinking of the well-being of the entire village, and that it would be better to just give Kuro the entire estate and fortune as a negotiation standpoint for sparing their lives (unaware that Kuro required Kaya's death to ensure a smooth transition into a life of peaceful luxury).", "abilities_and_powers": "Though not known to have any combat skill, Merry was durable enough to survive a direct attack from Kuro's Cat Claws.

McGuy cried tragically after the death of Whitebeard.", "abilities_and_powers": "McGuy has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the New World, becoming a subordinate of Whitebeard.

He appears to act seriously, and was initially off-put by, though eventually gained respect for Ace's cheerful nature. He is reliable and anxious at the same time. He enjoys writing and took the opportunity to write a story of his experiences on Ace's crew. If someone mocks his writing, he will respond by portraying them in a bad light and leaving their names out of the story. He also seems to be an avid thinker and planner, as shown when he developed and executed a plan to lead a Marine warship battalion into dangerous waters, and later calmly assessed his situation when he was stuck on the Sabaody Ferris wheel with Marine Ensign Isuka. Like many people, he was negatively prejudiced against the idea of Gol D. Roger having a son, though this changed once he got to know Ace. When he started starving on a desert island, he became willing to kill Ace to steal his food, although quickly came to regret this.", "abilities_and_powers": "Along with Mihar and Skull, Deuce serves as the brains of the Spade Pirates, being capable of forming and executing strategies for the crew. Despite not viewing himself as a capable offensive fighter, he seems to possess decent strength, as he was able to grab hold of Vice Admiral Draw and keep him occupied while Ace was busy without taking lasting injuries, and had also dealt with numerous bounty hunters during the Spade Pirates' voyage - although in the latter case he lamented he was only able to handle his own opponents and wasn't much help to others.

What makes him interesting is he apparently has a tail, although sometimes it cannot be seen. An example of when it clearly can be seen is when Bellamy first tackles him from behind, during the Bellamy Pirates vs. Saruyama Alliance fight, or when he is carrying wood to fix the Going Merry. Masira also has huge arms and some kind of piercing around his wrists. After the timeskip he no longer wears the jumpsuit, but has a shirt with the same design on the front. Other than this he looks the same as before.", "personality": "Masira often acts very serious, but is very silly and not very bright in reality. He is easily angered, notably most of all, by the idea of someone stealing his salvage operations, yet at the same time has a rather friendly disposition, especially if someone shows interest in his salvaging skills (putting a lot of effort to impress observers) or calls him a monkey. He is easily won over with friendship along with his brother when the Straw Hats appear at their home on Jaya Island. Like his brother, he is protective of Cricket who they have come to know as a father figure.

{"name": "Marco", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Marco is a tall, lean, muscular, blond-haired man with a rather sleepy look on his face and some stubble around his chin. He wears an open purple jacket and a light blue sash adorned with an elaborate golden-yellow belt around his waist. He has dark gray knee-long pants and black sandals, and on his left leg he wears what appears to be some sort of straw decoration, in a similar fashion to Arlong. While his chest was bare in his initial appearance, in his subsequent appearances he has the cross and crescent moon mustache symbol that resembles a black silhouette of Whitebeard's Jolly Roger tattooed on it. Robin and Luffy believe that Marco's head looks like a pineapple. Initially in the anime, Marco was given a generic crew member look of a black-haired man with pale skin and different clothes. When he later became more formally recognized in the story, his appearance was changed to what is depicted in the manga, along with his light purple jacket, his black pants and his dark red tattoo. Later, starting with Opening 13 \"One Day\", he was given another color scheme. Once again, his jacket was recolored in a much brighter purple, his pants were made dark blue, his tattoo blue and his skin a little brighter. Marco was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates twenty-two years ago as well. Even at the age of 23, his appearance, for the most part, resembles his present self. As a kid, Marco's signature tuft of hair was curlier. He sported a vertically striped shirt, with black pants, and no shoes. As a teenager, his appearance was not much different. After the timeskip, while working as a doctor on Whitebeard's home island, Marco wears a light button-up shirt as well as a pair of eyeglasses. He also has more facial hair. During the raid on Onigashima, Marco wears his initial attire and retains his eyeglasses.", "personality": "Marco is generally calm and level-headed in the face of adversity or challenge; the only strong emotional moments he has shown so far were directly related to Whitebeard's health (after he was stabbed in the torso by his own subordinate Squard and after his death). When Ace and Whitebeard were killed, Marco and the rest of the Whitebeard Pirates were in tears. In fact, seeing his captain, Whitebeard, get stabbed through the chest by a deceived Squard was enough for Marco to lose his usually unshakable cool-headedness that he immediately flew over to where they were to smash Squard's head against the Moby Dick's figurehead. He also demonstrates himself to be acute at detecting power, able to quickly notice the presence of Red-Haired Shanks' Hashoku Haki before anyone else aboard the Moby Dick as well as the underlying potential of Monkey D. Luffy. He clearly cares for his crew as he warned them to stay back from Shanks' Haki. Having been a member of the Whitebeard Pirates for at least thirty years, Marco has an extremely high degree of experience with exposure and combat inside the treacherous New World. After Whitebeard's and Portgas D. Ace's deaths at Marineford, Marco took the position of commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, highlighting his level of intelligence and suitability in taking up a commanding position. He appears to be somewhat playful, pretending to be hurt from Admiral Kizaru's attack with obvious sarcasm, though he can also quickly become serious. Marco seems to appreciate raw talent, even if it comes from someone whom he had never met before (i.e., Luffy). Because of this and based on the fact that Luffy intercepted Crocodile's attack on Whitebeard, Marco immediately took a liking to him. When he was an apprentice, he appeared to be a cheerful person. He was also encouraging as he cheered on Oden when he came close to passing Whitebeard's test to join the crew. He showed a playful side when he noticed Oden being close to Toki. Like some other characters, Marco has a very particular speech habit, which is a simple tic without meaning, ending his sentences with \"-yoi\" (?): e.g. \"arigat-yoi\" (?, \"thanks-yoi\") or \"mattero-yoi\" (?, \"wait-yoi\").", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former 1st division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Marco held authority over the 1,600 crew members lower-ranked than him, while enjoying particularly deep trust by Whitebeard as his \"right hand\". A veteran of the crew, Marco had been part of it for at least thirty years, from the time of Gol D. Roger in his apprentice days. Following Whitebeard's death, Marco assumed full leadership of the Whitebeard Pirates, their retreat from Marineford seemingly made under his command. Later on, it was he who led the crew into the Payback War against the Blackbeard Pirates, until the crew's subsequent dissolution after the Blackbeard Pirates had defeated them. Marco's status in the world is well-established, not least by his massive bounty of 1,374,000,000. After the war at Marineford, the Five Elders mentioned Marco (only him by name) with the remaining Whitebeard Pirates as one of the few groups left capable of defeating Blackbeard, who at that point was already held to be the chief candidate for succeeding Whitebeard as Emperor. Other Emperors have also expressed their respect for Marco: Shanks on three separate occasions called on him to join his crew, and Big Mom acknowledged Marco's strength by noting that his allegiance to the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance was unbecoming of a man of his caliber. In battle, Marco is shown to be a very powerful combatant. At Marineford he, if only briefly, fought and held his own against each of the three Marine admirals, indicating his capabilities. During the Raid on Onigashima, Marco had a brief, head-on clash with Big Mom on what seemed to be even terms, Marco appearing confident that he could keep the Emperor occupied. When abandoning their confrontation, Big Mom stated that she did not have enough souls to spare on Marco. Later during the raid, Marco effectively held off and overpowered the two All-Stars King and Queen, Kaidou's two strongest combatants with bounties over 1.3 billion, at once; however, Marco did state that fighting the two was difficult for him, and he sustained some light injuries amid the engagement until eventually (if only temporarily) succumbing to exhaustion. Marco is shown to have a strong will, remaining unfazed by the Emperor Shanks' Haoshoku Haki as it was knocking his lower-ranked crewmates unconscious by the dozens."},

This trait was fully confirmed by Kabu, who stated that Mansherry is really kind to everyone. The reason for Leo's misinterpretation is that Mansherry has a huge crush on him, as seen when she reacted happily when he saved her, calling him a knight in shining armor and even blushing when he caught her. However, this did not stop her from punching Leo after he bluntly remarked that she had gained weight; Mansherry shows a typical tsundere attitude toward Leo alone.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a dwarf, she is incredibly fast and much stronger than her size would suggest.

He also wears a yellow sash, like his two older brothers. When he and his family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, he wore a dark shirt.", "personality": "Manboshi is perhaps the most energetic among his brothers. He talks in song, and has a habit of saying \"Akkamanbo\". It appears he can be rather unpredictable, as he asked Ryuboshi to dance with him in the middle of looking for the Straw Hat Pirates. Like Ryuboshi, he sings when he talks, except he does not sing in scale. His habit of singing came from his effort to cheer his sister up to protect the Fish-Man Island from her powers.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince, he has some royal authority granted to him. Along with Fukaboshi and Ryuboshi, Manboshi is one of the three most powerful warriors of the Neptune Army. The Minister of the Right claimed that the Straw Hats would be in trouble if they were confronted by Manboshi and his brothers, however the minister underestimatedthe Straw Hats. Further testament to his strength is when he, along with his brothers, took down the sea beasts that easily defeated the rest of the Neptune Army including the two ministers. The New Fish-Man Pirate officers also had to take at least two Energy Steroids to defeat him and his brothers."},

He has been sporting this hairstyle since his days as a young Marine. He also has a thick scar on the right side of his forehead that did not exist before he enlisted in the Marines. In addition, he has what appear to be three lines at the bottom of each of his eyes, which may be his eyelashes. He sports a Marine coat and shirt that is standard among Marine officers.", "personality": "As a Marine, Makko has a strong sense of justice, and as such, has no patience for failure.

{"name": "Magellan", "episode": "Episode 528", "chapter": "Chapter 425", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Hannyabal in Chapter 526.", "appearance": "Magellan is a large man, about three times the height of a normal human. He has a face that resembles a mandrill, with very sharp teeth and a thick beard. His fingers closely resemble those of the Blue Gorillas. He wears bat wings and horn-like ornaments on his head, the latter of which he can pull out and use as weapons. Underneath those horns, he has short black twintail-styled hair. Overall, Magellan resembles a devil. While most guards wear a white-colored uniform, Magellan wears a black-colored suit with a red shirt underneath. His suit features more buttons than those of his subordinates. Draped over his right shoulder is a piece of rope. He wears what appears to be the standard cap of Impel Down workers. Twenty years ago, while Magellan was still the vice-chief, he had the same attire as he does today, with the exception of the uniform being tan instead of black, and a green shirt. After the timeskip, Magellan still wears the same attire as two years ago. He has gained scars on the left side of his face which cover his cheek and eye. Also, his left wing and his left horn are broken and have been repaired with sheet metal. All these scars and new designs on his appearance are very likely from the near-death experience he gained from the Level 6 inmates escaping. When he was a young child, he was chubby, and his horns were much smaller. He had hairy arms and his fingernails were painted black. He had a light-colored long sleeve shirt with a three headed dragon on it along with light colored shorts and black shoes. He is depicted as watering some flowers. However, they died due to the poison oozing off his arm, showing that he already had his Devil Fruit power as a child.", "personality": "Magellan's biggest quirk is his severe diarrhea brought upon by his frequent consumption of poisoned food. His Devil Fruitability gives him immunity from actually being poisoned, but it does not spare him from diarrhea. As a result, he spends approximately ten hours each day in the bathroom relieving himself and eight hours sleeping; even after suffering such conditions multiple times, he still insists on eating poisoned food. It has been hinted that he is actually agoraphobic and enjoys dark, enclosed spaces. Though he only performs roughly four hours of duty per day as Warden of Impel Down, he still takes his role quite seriously and does not tolerate the prisoners' bad behavior. As he has permission to execute any one of them he sees fit, he shows no hesitation to drench them in his Hydra's lethal poison, as seen with what happened on Level 6 when insulted by prisoners. Magellan also takes great pride in keeping Impel Down's reputation of being impenetrable and inescapable, and felt personally insulted when Monkey D. Luffy became the first to stain that record since Shiki 20 years ago. Despite his demotion, he is still considered the most reliable man of Impel Down. Magellan's pride with Impel Down led him to reject the help of the Marines and any other outsiders, and instead took a risk and released Shiryu to assist him, which turned out to be a critical mistake that nearly cost Magellan his life. Even when he was in a near-death state, Magellan wanted to take responsibility for the Level 6 convicts to the point that he wanted to commit suicide for his failure. Magellan seems to find it amusing whenever someone he does not particularly like gets poisoned or suffocated by his powers, evident when he was seen chuckling at Hannyabal after he sighed a poisonous mist in the latter's direction. While he also does not tolerate Hannyabal's poisonous (the actual term used is punned with the word distant) comments he himself is prone to use them against himself. It is also shown that he is not as emotionally stern as Hannyabal, as he clearly went head over heels for and was easily persuaded by Boa Hancock, while the vice warden remained focused and serious with the crisis they were having. Despite the silly aspects of himself, he is an extremely serious combatant, speaking little and never toying with his opponent. His ruthlessness applies not only to the prisoners, but also to his own men, as seen when he was berating a guard who was accidentally poisoned by his Hydra. He will also not tolerate any of his own men who abuse their power, as he dismissed Shiryu for killing prisoners for fun and had him jailed in Level 6, this intolerance renders Magellan unable to forgive, as even though he accepted Shiryu's assistance, he only postponed the death sentence, rather than retracting it.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former warden of Impel Down, Magellan is a very powerful individual who was in complete control of the prison. However, after the timeskip, with Hannyabal now the warden and Magellan having been demoted to vice warden, his control of the prison is second to Hannyabal. He has both the authority and the ability to execute any of the prisoners within Impel Down as he sees fit. Despite being occupied by intense diarrhea for 10 hours per day, sleeping for another 8 and recessing for another 2, Magellan is still capable of easily coordinating the defense squads of Impel Down in case of a potential break-in or break-out, as well as being fully aware of all the mechanics of the prison's traps. However, since Magellan's work hours are limited by his diarrhea, Shiryu was considered more dangerous. Despite this, he was apparently the one responsible for defeating Shiryu and locking him in Level 6, although it is unknown how it happened. Even Emporio Ivankov, a commander in the Revolutionary Army, was shown to be no match for him, being defeated in no time and very easily. According to Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, Magellan is known to silence even the most ultimate of prisoners. Indeed that all the prisoners are afraid of him. Even two former Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile and Jinbe, were concerned of Magellan's upcoming arrival. He also easily defeated Luffy, who even after using Galdino's wax armor, effectively against the Magellan fruit, was unable to stop him. He also easily dispatched the Warlord of the Sea Blackbeard and his crew in one fell swoop when they first met. However, according to Shiryu, this happened because they underestimated Magellan's strength."},

His signature features are his sideburns that are curved and pointed inwards towards his face and his mouth that is pointed upwards when closed. He wears the standard Marine shirt and cap. In the manga, he wears epaulettes which may serve to differentiate himself in rank as a Chief Petty Officer. In the anime, however, he lacks the epaulettes and so, in terms of uniform, looks no different from a common Marine sailor. During the Summit War of Marineford, he wore a Marine officer's coat over his standard Marine shirt.", "personality": "Mashikaku is somewhat afraid of those with a higher authority than him, as shown when he was afraid of what the higher-ups would say if Smoker disobeyed them, and was also afraid of Smoker when he shouted at him that he did not care.", "abilities_and_powers": "Mashikaku appears to be somewhat strong as he survived the battle against Whitebeard and his allies."},

At the back end of the shell is a tail and a very tiny pair of hindlegs, and the armadillo's head and forelegs, which are both disproportionately small, can also appear at the front of the shell. The shell gives Madilloman significant defensive capabilities, and he can make the armadillo use its head and forelegs to cover and protect his face.

On his chest is the sun tattoo that symbolizes Macro's being once a part of the Sun Pirates. Macro is roughly larger than Hatchan in size. Macro's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his large lower lip and jaw.

He is also very headstrong, as he was ready to fight any Marines who came to the island after Doflamingo supposedly resigned from the Shichibukai. When fighting Hajrudin he has proven himself to be both merciless and cruel, increasing the destructive power of an attack against an opponent who was injured to the point of barely being able to stand.

He has long brown hair and wears a green hat similar to a crown that has one of its points bent. He also wears a green jumper, goggles, beige boots, beige gloves, and a red tie. He usually carries a gun with him. After becoming a pirate, Leo wears a dark-colored pirate coat and a pirate hat with his crew's jolly roger on it. The hat has two feathers on the left side. He also holds a cutlass sword.", "personality": "Leo has a warrior-like personality, which befits his role as the leader of his kingdom's military corps. He follows the laws of his kingdom closely, as he demanded Robin give a weapon or her clothes in exchange for her freedom. He is also trusted by the other dwarves in the kingdom to lead them into battles, and to issue commands and instructions when needed. Like his fellow dwarves, Leo is extremely gullible. However, he appears to possess an additional, humorous measure of obliviousness, as he misinterprets Princess Mansherry's flirtatious behavior towards him as selfishness, meanness, and capriciousness, not realizing that it is actually caused by her feelings of affection towards him. Despite his gullibility, Leo refused to believe Trebol when he said that Usopp lied to them about being a hero. He, like Kin'emon, appears to have little knowledge of Devil Fruits, as he referred to his and Robin's powers as magic. Leo is also righteous as when Charlos tried to enslave Shirahoshi, Leo did not hesitate to come to her defense, showing that he is willing to defy a World Noble.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a dwarf, Leo possesses extreme physical strength, extreme agility, and the ability to cultivate any kind of plant. He seems to be very resilient as he was able to survive an explosion. The fact that he is the chief soldier suggests that his fighting ability is higher than that of the other dwarves. With his speed, he can use a needle in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers to swiftly bind multiple unconscious Donquixote Pirates executives and subordinates of Giolla. At the same time with his strength, skill and quick thinking he was able to defeat Giolla, an officer of the Donquixote Pirates."},

Lassoo is always suffering from some kind of cold that makes him have a running nose and sneeze (which makes him fire cannonballs). It is unknown if this is an actual disease or a side-effect from being an inanimate gun unnaturally absorbing a devil-fruit.", "personality": "He seems to be very loyal to his master, as he did everything he said without question.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a gun that has absorbed a Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund, Lassoo can transform into a dachshund, becoming literally a gun-dog. In turn, Lassoo gains animal sentience and becomes a mobile mortar, increasing efficiency in combat.

He is also very tall, as much so as the majority of his crewmates, and slim. He wears an off-white collared long-sleeve shirt patterned with yellow crosses and navy jumper pants. His most distinguishing accessories are his classic black top hat and red wooden cane, with which he also wears a pair of gold hoop earrings. His lips are abnormally dark red. After becoming the captain of the fifth fleet, he added a new black (white in the anime) cape with feathered collar to his attire.", "personality": "Laffitte lived in West Blue and worked as a sheriff, but was exiled because he was excessively cruel and violent. In contradiction to his past, Laffitte now seems to be a calm and affable individual that is constantly smiling. He apparently did not attempt to assist in fighting alongside his crew when Portgas D. Ace attacked, whistling as he ran away with the rest of the crew to a safe watching distance. When Teach ordered his crew to attack, Laffitte gleefully smiled as he shot Whitebeard to death, and also when Teach used his new-found Gura Gura no Mi to wretched havoc on the already devastated Marineford as Teach taunted the Marines about sinking their Headquarters. Despite being a malevolent pirate, Laffitte has an extremely refined and sophisticated personality, always speaking in a polite and courteous manner even when threatening people such Avalo Pizarro for wanting to replace Teach as captain.

Like the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates, Laffitte believes strongly in luck, fate, and dreams.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former sheriff, Laffitte had authority and power over citizens. However, due to his extreme cruelty, he lost this authority when he was exiled. After the time-skip, he is officially the Captain of the Blackbeard Pirates 5th fleet/ship and part of a group of Ten Titanic Captains that personally guard the Emperor, Blackbeard. Although his combat abilities are unknown, he must be someone very powerful. The fact, that Blackbeard refuses to accept any weakling in his crew, even going so far as to reject Super Rookie Jewelry Bonney with a bounty of 140,000,000, is further testament to Laffite's power. He seems to have confidence in his abilities as he threatened to kill Avalo Pizarro, one of the most powerful criminals in Level 6. He was also quickly recognized by Vice Admiral Tsuru. It was stated during the Marineford Arc that he was able to hypnotize Marines to open the Gates of Justice for him."},

He is bald with veins protruding from his head. He has a beard and wrinkled skin. In his appearances, his eyes have been shadowed out, as they areextremely squinted. His mouth is also shadowed, suggesting that he doesn't have any teeth despite being able to speak and eat. He wears a blue jumpsuit with a white arrow pointing upwards with two blue lightning bolt-like shapes pointing towards his shoulders. The jumpsuit has a belt with the letter \"G\" on the buckle. He also wears white gloves and boots. He wears red tights under his jumpsuit, with blue arrows pointing downward on his legs. As a child, Lao G had a curly patch of hair on his forehead with the front curl resembling a G. He wore a shirt with an arrow pointing upwards that had a \"G\" on it, a sash around his waist, white gloves, and black pants. His eyes were also wide and visible, yet to turn squinted. At age 54, he wore a dark blue bunny-eared hat and had a more muscular body, as well as a black beard trimmed to form a G, and was shown to still have teeth. At age 60, his hair had started to gray and he was becoming pot-bellied. He wore a cap with devilish horns and eyes, gloves, a blue bodysuit with a yellow gold matrix-pattern, what seems to be briefs over it and a belt with the green letter \"G\" as the gold yellow buckle.", "personality": "He is a stern and loyal man, as is seen by hisfollowing Doflamingo's orders to the letter and regarding his captain's orders as absolute. He is very calm and analytical, as he was able to deduce that Doflamingo had an ulterior motive for his supposed abdication. However, despite his calm demeanor, Lao G has a bombastic and brutal side, joyfully showing his techniques against enemies to prove himself as a superior fighter and viciously pummeling his foes with brutal efficiency. In the anime, Lao G takes great pride in his skill, boasting to Sai, a formidable fighter in his own right, that he would need a century's worth of training to defeat him. He also has an odd quirk that makes him emphasize the letter \"G\" in his words and even goes so far as to mimic it with his hands in various ways. Lao G can also be exceptionally cruel as he gleefully mocked Baby 5 for being convenient for the Donquixote Family's purposes due to her desperation to be needed and viciously disposed of Don Chinjao when he was distracted. He seems to be rather senile in his old age, such as when he went back into the elevator that he had just left instead of going to the Toy House. He appears to be far-sighted, as he needed glasses in order to spot Kabu up close. This does not seem to affect his fighting capabilities, however, as he was able to swat Kabu away quickly with minimal effort. He is also hard of hearing. He has his own Laughter Style: \"Fafafafafafa\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Lao G held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members and addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the Corrida Colosseum's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high, despite his age. It is said that when Lao G and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory.This is especially notable, as Lao G is the only one of the officers to lack Devil Fruit powers or fish-man heritage, while boasting the same achievement based on physical skill alone. Doflamingo also trusted him enough to guard the entrance to his factory from the Straw Hats' actions."},
{"name": "Laboon", "episode": "Episode 102", "chapter": "Chapter 62", "year": 1999, "note": "His name was revealed by Crocus in Chapter 103.", "appearance": "Laboon is an extremely large whale, comparable in size to most of the Calm Belt's Sea Kings; his eye alone is several times larger than the Going Merry. His skin is black (blue in the anime), coupled with short fins and a fluked tail. Much of his head is crisscrossed with scars, from his many years of tackling Reverse Mountain. After meeting the Straw Hats, Laboon had a crude replica of their Jolly Roger painted over these scars. His interior contains a complex network of metal chambers and tunnels, installed - presumably by Crocus - to deal with his habit of swallowing ships that challenge or annoy him. The largest of these chambers, built into his stomach, can receive newly-swallowed ships from his esophagus and allow them to leave through a set of gates leading to his blowhole; it also holds an artificial island with a cabin for Crocus to \"vacation\" in. This chamber is \"painted\" with an unknown material that not only resembles the daytime sky (complete with clouds) but apparently produces its own light. 52 years ago, he had rounder teeth and was around the size of a small dinghy, just large enough to carry two or three men. Brook remarked that he looked \"cute\" around this time.", "personality": "Laboon is heavily emotional and surprisingly understanding for a whale. He has both the patience and loyalty of a good friend. He formed strong bonds with the Rumbar Pirates, Crocus (his caretaker), and the Straw Hat Pirates as well. He is also a bit stubborn, as he would not believe the fact that his friends had died, despite Crocus's constant explanation. He would hit the Red Line constantly, completely ignoring Crocus's protests. He also seems to have a bit of a playful nature, as evidenced by Crocus. In his early years, he was a happy little Island Whale who formed a strong bond with the Rumbar Pirates. However, his happiness was shattered and he fell into a deep depression after he was told that they had fled the Grand Line, leaving him behind. His strong will and determination was led by a blind ambition to see his friends again, clinging on to what little hope he had for their safety. Because of this, he tried to break through the Red Line, so that he could get to the West Blue and rejoin his friends. Later, when Luffy fought him and painted the Straw Hat Jolly Roger on his head, Luffy promised to have a rematch when they meet again. Laboon honored this visual promise on his head and stopped bashing into the Red Line so that it would not disappear. His connection with the Rumbar Pirates remained strong even after that, as when Brook joined the Straw Hat Pirates, Laboon was noted to be unusually happy.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to the foremost part of his head, called \"hammer head\", that has spike-like protuberances, Laboon is resistant to most physical damage, and was able to survive daily headbutts against the Red Line for decades (albeit not without medical assistance from Crocus). However, he did react in pain when Luffy slammed the mast of the Going Merry into a fresh wound on his head. Laboon is also able to swallow small-to-medium-sized ships without much difficulty, trapping them inside his stomach. While his stomach acid is mild enough that even an unarmed human can survive brief exposure, lengthy exposure can very much prove fatal. Intellectually, Laboon is highly capable of understanding both human languageand psyches. This is partially due to his \"brain oil\" (sperm oil), mainly used for sensing obstacles or searching for preys, but apparently can also be used to recognize music."},

His real name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 704. His true identity was revealed by Leo in Chapter 739.", "appearance": "Kyros is a large muscular man with long, flowing hair and a pointy, upwards-facing beard. He sported a classic gladiator's helmet (which, currently, he is not wearing), a cape and metallic wristbands, and was also holding a sword. He also possessed a scar on his forehead from his final fight as a gladiator with King Riku and later sacrificed his left leg to help King Riku before he was turned into a toy. As Thunder Soldier, he is a small toy soldier whose body resembles a dark-colored uniform with four buttons. He has a block-shaped head, square eyes with two blush marks painted underneath, a rectangular nose, a small angular mustache, and a hinged mouth. He also has lanky limbs and a wind-up key on his back. He wears a large round hat with the letters \"SOL\" printed on it. He has a small stub where his left leg used to be, and he wears a roller skate on his right foot, which he has trouble balancing on when standing still. He also carries a small toy rifle.", "personality": "In his younger years, he was shown to be a brutal killer, capable of killing in cold blood and even attacking King Riku. However, he did so in revenge for a dear friend, and keeping himself alive. He actually felt guilty and remorseful about his past as a criminal and felt that he was too unclean and unworthy of many things (such as continuing to interact with Scarlett before their marriage or holding his daughter with his bare hands, the latter making his wife calling him weird), while feeling depressed that the world would remember him as a murderer. During his first appearance, he is very defiant of authority as seen when he was yelling at some police officers. He also appears to be proud to be a toy that brings happiness to people, and gets angry when someone says he is serious, although he knows there are times when he has to be and does so without complaint. Because Sugar failed to make a contract with him, Kyros was the only toy who could rebel against the Donquixote Family. As such, he took his duty as the lone toy who is able to rebel against Doflamingo very seriously, having worked diligently with the Dwarves since his time as a toy in order to save the toys and the Dwarves together. He is kind and helpful towards common people. While he appears to enjoy being a toy, he is saddened by the fact that he cannot shed tears or feel the warmth of a person's touch like people can. When he was raising Rebecca as the Thunder Soldier, he tried his best to make her happy and was not above playing dead, striking strange poses or even singing songs in an attempt to make her happy. In addition, he was shown to be very protective of Rebecca as seen when he protected her from kidnappers and wild dogs. On the other hand, he was potentially overprotective of her given that he often punched anyone who made her cry or tried to give her love letters. In battle, Kyros is a very brutal fighter, as after having returned to his human form, he immediately decapitated Doflamingo's duplicate in an instant and broke Buffalo's neck while mowing down anyone who stood in his way. He is also very determined to save those dear to him, as when Doflamingo prepared to kill King Riku, Kyros immediately freed himself from his Seastone shackles by cutting off his own left leg.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kyros has been an accomplished fighter for much of his life. Even at the young age of 15, he was able to kill two people in a fight. He is the strongest fighter to have ever entered the Colosseum, winning 3000 fights while taking only a single hit from \"Ricky\" though he had let his guard down upon recognizing his opponent. He is an extremely proficient combatant, having defeated many powerful challengers, including a giant and a fish-man, which he fought underwater. He was well known enough for even the Warlord Doflamingo to offer him to join his crew, and when Marine Captain Koby first met Kyros, he could immediately tell with his Kenbunshoku Haki that Kyros was very strong. Another testament of his strength is shown in how he single-handedly sank the ships of a pirate crew that had kidnapped Scarlett, whereas all of her other guards were easily defeated; Kyros defeated the entire pirate crew (leaving their vessel in ruins), without so much as getting a scratch on himself or his ward Scarlett. His abilities are also illustrated from the fact that he managed to train Rebecca in combat to a level where she not only gained a reputation for herself as a fighter, but even managed to become the victor in her block, despite being a toy which would obviously impose restrictions when instructing someone in combat."},

Tama has great faith in the Kozuki Family, as she used their name as a threat to those who upset her. However, she can also be careless, as shown when she revealed her allegiance to the Kozuki Family to the Beasts Pirates, drank out of a contaminated river and falling ill in the process, and disregarded her master's warnings not to show her powers in front of others, which caught the attention of Holed'em. Tama speaks with an Edo and a Thoku dialect. She tends to end her sentences in de-yansu (?).

{"name": "Kuzan", "episode": "Episode 303", "chapter": "Chapter 225", "year": 2003, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 318. Better known by his former epithet Aokiji.", "appearance": "Kuzan is an incredibly tall, slim, yet muscular man. At 298cm tall, he is just slightly shorter than the other two admirals pre-timeskip and he is the shortest of the Blackbeard Titanic Captains. He has black, curly hair cut to chin length that fans out at the tips, tanned skin, and an altogether lean, long build. His standard outfit while in the Marines consists of a white buttoned-up vest with standing collar over a long-sleeved navy-blue shirt, with matching white trousers and black dress shoes. This is all rarely accompanied by a matching white suit jacket. He also wears a yellow tie divided geometrically by black lines and a sleep mask on his forehead. During his preparations for the war against Whitebeard, Kuzan had a white Marine admiral's coat (golden epaulettes and for him being the ice user, blue cuffs) draped over him like a cape, as did the other admirals. He was also seen wearing a green and purple sleep mask at all times two years ago from the present timeline. In contrast to Borsalino and Sakazuki, Kuzan is far younger than his colleagues, being less than fifty years old. His looks, combined with his manner, make him appear even younger than he actually is. As a child, Kuzan had a grimace on his face. He wore a dirty light blue shirt and a purple pair of shorts with white stripes. He carried an umbrella tied on his back, a bottle of alcohol and a backpack. Also, his hair was curlier compared to his current hairstyle. In his youth, Kuzan wore a white Marine cap and a shirt. Twenty-two years ago, during the Ohara Incident, Kuzan wore a dark blue bandanna with a white Marine symbol on it, as well as a pair of black round sunglasses, as well as an indigo coat with the Marine emblem on the left chest and the back. This outfit was also what he wore 27 years ago, during the Battle of Edd War. After the timeskip, his attire bears similarities to what he wore in his 20's. He wears a blue bandana that covers most of his hair, leaving only the tips which fan out. He wears a white V-neck shirt with black trousers, as well as an open dark blue green trench coat that extends past his knees. He also now wears black cowboy boots and travels with a knapsack carrying his belongings, along with his old pair of green round sunglasses. Like his rival Sakazuki, he also has grown facial hair, namely, a thin mustache and a beard. After his duel on Punk Hazard, Kuzan received several burn scars spanning from the right side of his neck down to his entire right shoulder and onto his torso. His right hand is also heavily scarred, and he lost part of his left leg, for which he now wears a prosthesis made of ice formed by his Devil Fruit ability. During the Egghead Arc, Kuzan wears a light-colored frilled dress shirt with a cravat, dark pants, and a dark-colored trench coat with a fur collar which he wears draped on his shoulders.", "personality": "Kuzan is a very laid-back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and \"Lazy Justice\" (, Darakekitta Seigi?) (as he describes his motto himself) often leads others to believe he cannot possibly be a marine of such a high ranking, which causes them to underestimate him, making him all the more dangerous (it is unknown whether this is a facade or if he is genuinely lazy). However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action. During the Whitebeard War at Marineford, Aokiji grudgingly shredded his usual lax and friendly nature, for a more ruthless and aggressive personality, repeatedly targeting Whitebeard himself with his Hie Hie no Mi, managing to severely injure \"Diamond\" Jozu and generally hampering any attempts at rescue or escape for the invading pirate fleets. In accordance with the age difference between him and the other pre-timeskip admirals, Kuzan does not refer to himself with \"Washi\" (?), the \"I\" typical for older men but the \"I\" more frequently used by younger men and teens, the rather rough \"Ore\" (?); altogether, his manner of speaking is far more lax than Borsalino's (who is exceedingly polite), containing a lot of ellipses and contractions, yet lacking the rude connotation of Sakazuki's speech, and being far more calm. He tends to begin addressing people with \"excuse me\"/\"I hate to interrupt, but\" (, chotto gomen na?). Aokiji is a compassionate man, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with his ability and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara by providing a small boat while also a trail of ice for her to leave safely even sabotaging the ships that were about to go after her. Despite being a marine, this compassion can even extend to pirates as long as their actions are mostly benevolent. He chose not to arrest or kill Luffy because the young pirate had defeated Crocodile beforehand, thus saving Arabasta from the latter's malevolence. In contrast to his former colleague, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan sometimes tolerates compromises with pirates. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he follows Lazy Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in and does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, even if reluctantly. He froze his former friend Jaguar D. Saul during the Ohara Incident following this reasoning. As a marine, Kuzan was a faithful follower of the World Government. His motto used to be \"Burning/Fired Up Justice\" (, Moeagaru Seigi?) before switching to Lazy Justice. He always tried to follow orders, but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to them. Even as Kuzan followed his orders, he would occasionally exhibit a sense of mercy and honor other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Kuzan has come to realize the depths to which the World Government will sink to accomplish their goals. His relaxed demeanor while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of fleet admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position due to the latter's immense ruthlessness and dueled his fellow admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Sakazuki's command. Having left the Marines and realizing just how truly corrupt the World Government had become after the timeskip, Kuzan became a wanderer. He still cares for his friends, rescuing Smoker from Donquixote Doflamingo's fury during a visit to Punk Hazard. However, Kuzan appears to be now involved in shady dealings with pirates, having joined forces with the Blackbeard Pirates for unknown reasons. Doflamingo was convinced that Kuzan had something planned while Smoker thought the same, as he was aware of Kuzan's involvement in the Underworld. Kuzan reassured Smoker that he had not changed at all, cryptically stating that he could still accomplish things as an independent observer. After joining the Blackbeard Pirates, Kuzan openly expressed he did so because he wishes to begin living for himself instead of for others, perhaps showing some resentment for his time as an enlisted officer and the things he was made to do or prevented from doing. He wanted to take back his personal freedom and live life on his own terms, something Teach sympathized with, and was seen being quite jolly with a somewhat dry sense of humor as they drank together. He has a recurring phrase, \"Arara\", meaning \"Oh, my\", which is frequently used when something surprises him.", "abilities_and_powers": "While an admiral, Kuzan held power over the thousands of lower-ranked Marine personnel, his status being just below Fleet Admiral Sengoku's. He could command fleets, have a say on the overall strategy of the organization, and issue special orders, like the enactment of a Buster Call on any island he deemed a threat or delegate to lower-status government agents the same privilege. With his resignation, of course, came the forfeiture of any such powers. Nonetheless, despite the outward indolence that Kuzan showed in casual situations, holding such a high military office bore out his leadership prowess. Further attesting to these skills as a leader, plus his charisma, is the support Kuzan enjoyed from among subordinate ranks to become fleet admiral following the Summit War, as well as having Sengoku himself personally select him as his successor (as opposed to Akainu's backing coming mainly from governmental dignitaries). As a combatant, Kuzan with his fellow admirals was held as the \"Greatest Military Power\" that the World Government and Marine Headquarters could bring to bear, making him one of the world's strongest people. Being one of the Marines' chiefest assets, his departure had a notably detrimental impact on their force, with one of the Five Elders referencing his \"enormous power\" in his dismay over Kuzan's affiliation with the Blackbeard Pirates. According to Brannew, Kuzan's strength as a Marine \"hero\" was not gifted at birth but rather built up by training, as was the case with Monkey D. Garp. Still, since his early days in the Marines, Kuzan seemed quick to learn everything that instructors would teach him, leading him to start training under Garp as he subsequently rose through the ranks. During Kuzan's time as a vice admiral over two decades ago, his strength was already considered abnormal for someone of his rank, as illustrated by Jaguar D. Saul, an extremely powerful giant who used to be a vice admiral himself, being taken down by Kuzan easily with a mere two attacks, after having fled at Kuzan's mere sight. The first hint given to Kuzan's reputation involved Nico Robin; though arguably the most well-composed of the Straw Hats, she completely panicked and lost her grip in the admiral's presence, this relating to her childhood trauma (despite Kuzan having spared her as a child). During his first encounter with the Straw Hats on Long Ring Long Land, Kuzan effortlessly overwhelmed their top three fighters in a single moment, followed by him incapacitating Robin without her able to retaliate in any measure, and subsequently dealt a swift but crushing defeat to Monkey D. Luffy in a duel that saw the rookie pirate completely at the admiral's mercy, unable to lay so much as a scratch on him (though largely due to having no means to hurt the admiral's Logia form). During the Summit War, Kuzan's power was well-exemplified against the Whitebeard Pirates, with him engaging Whitebeard, the world's strongest pirate, head-to-head and holding his own, albeit briefly until Jozu's interference. He would go on to battle Jozu, one of Whitebeard's most formidable men, and defeat him with relative ease upon exploiting an instant's distraction of his foe, robbing him of an arm and incapacitating him for the total rest of the war. Ultimately, Kuzan himself emerged from the war almost entirely unscathed, with nothing but a small bruise to show for it. Against Akainu, Kuzan would prove his then-fellow admiral's equal in strength. A one-on-one duel between the two saw them meeting one another blow for blow throughout most of the fight, such that it took ten entire days to settle; though Akainu was the one to emerge victorious, both men sustained grievous injuries. Upon encountering the Blackbeard Pirates a year after his fight against Akainu, Kuzan was able to swiftly defeat several of Blackbeard's officers, including the enormous Sanjuan Wolf and other ex-prisoners from Impel Down's Level 6, by freezing them up in a matter of seconds. In the year since joining hands with Blackbeard, Kuzan has become a powerful asset of the Emperor's crew, and with his position of Titanic Captain comes the authority over the Blackbeard Pirates' Tenth Ship. In particular, Kuzan's knowledge of the Marines' inner workings, including the most secretive organization SWORD, provides valuable intel for the crew. In Totto Land, Kuzan managed to ice up and thus defeat Charlotte Cracker, one of Big Mom's strongest commanders with an 860,000,0000 bounty, without coming to harm himself. When he approached Garp face-to-face on Hachinosu, Kuzan began fighting on nearly even grounds against his former mentor who, despite bemoaning his decline in strength, still demonstrated monstrous fighting ability against the many Blackbeard Pirates present on the island, with Garp initially holding the upper hand against the ex-admiral. Ultimately though, with the aid of his fellow Titanic Captains, Kuzan managed to subdue Garp and left him on the ground impaled with a massive icicle, slowly freezing up, even though Garp had been more preoccupied with letting his students escape the island than with defeating the enemy. Aside from combat, Kuzan is shown to have enough navigation skill to be able to traverse the Grand Line seas using a simple bicycle (assisted by his ice powers to create a track by which to cycle on the water)."},
{"name": "Kurozumi Orochi", "episode": "Episode 927", "chapter": "Chapter 921", "year": 2018, "note": "He was first mentioned by Kin'emon in Chapter 818. His name was revealed by Kin'emon in Chapter 909.", "appearance": "Orochi was a rather large man with a big head and stocky build. He appeared to be balding, with his dark purple hair being mostly seen on the sides and back of his head, and he had a long topknot in the back, as well as a thin mustache that sticked upward. His two upper canine teeth were longer than his other teeth and were blunt, remaining so in his Zoan hybrid form. He wore a gold kimono with a fan-shaped pattern on it, a blue robe with flowers on it, and a crown on his head. In his transformed state, the main head was a darker olive green with red scales while the other heads were a lighter shade with yellow scales. Every head had black horns, orange eyebrows, and light purple scales. Each head also had red eyes with blue irises and purple tongues.", "personality": "As one of the last members of the Kurozumi Family, who were disgraced and stripped of their power and authority, Orochi developed an immense greed and thirst for power from an early age due to being forced to live in poverty since birth. When he worked as a servant for Yasuie, Orochi outwardly exhibited a timid and servile attitude, but this was all an act to steal money by preying on the sympathies of others. Orochi was in truth extremely deceptive and dishonorable, bending laws and rules to suit his own needs and never acknowledging promises or deals to those that he viewed as a threat. Having been twisted by the Kurozumi Family's unfair persecution since his childhood, Orochi was an extremely cruel and oppressive tyrant who took joy in making his subjects suffer as revenge for his family's persecution. Under his rule, the people of Wano suffered great famines. The officials under him also harshly enforced his regime, and he collaborated with Kaidou to not only kill Kozuki Oden, but also allowed the Beasts Pirates to turn Wano into a nearly complete wasteland in exchange for borrowing Kaidou's power and protection, disregarding his country and people in favor of his own self-interest. Due to his power and connections, he was completely fearless and arrogant, proclaiming that he did not fear the Celestial Dragons nor the Marines. He even shot a CP0 agent, confident that they could do nothing against him. This arrogance blinded him to the fact that he was in truth just a pawn for Kaidou and that Kaidou only protected him as long as it suited his own interests. Even as Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates turned Wano into a wasteland, Orochi expected that the Flower Capital would remain prosperous and was shocked when Kaidou revealed his intentions of using it to make more factories. He defiantly opposed Kaidou's New Onigashima Project by reprimanding him for his ingratitude, all while clearly forgetting the fact that he had completely relied on Kaidou's power for protection. Although he hated his country, Orochi desired to create an image of him being a heroic and strong ruler with a happy populace. During his reign, he had schools teach propaganda about him being the one to defeat Oden and maintain the country's isolation when, in reality, Kaidou was the one who did those things. When meeting with CP0, he claimed that the citizens around them were happy, although this reality only existed in the wealthy Flower Capital. To give the impoverished citizens the facade of happiness, Orochi put defective SMILE fruits in their food supply to render them unable to express negative emotions. Orochi was an extremely domineering and unreasonable man with absolutely no tolerance to anyone who defied or spoke ill of him, even if it was out of his earshot and in casual discussion. He made those actions a capital crime, which the Gifters enforced. Orochi was petty enough to kill any man, woman or child who offended him, going to any lengths to see them dead (only showing temporary hesitation towards a woman he held feelings for) and refused to take responsibility for the consequences of his own actions, preferring to blame others instead by branding them as criminals. Orochi had an extremely murderous mindset, becoming angry if a target escaped from his wrath and would send countless subordinates or even assassins to deal with individuals he wanted gone, no matter how threatening they may be, as well as those that protect or assist said individuals. The subordinates that fail to uphold his rule are callously discarded from his ranks and then punished accordingly. Orochi was also immensely extravagant and hedonistic, as he loved to hold banquets with luxurious food and drinks accompanied by refined music and dancing. He was picky with his choice of food and extremely wasteful. Moreover, he employed only the finest geisha of Wano, such as Komurasaki, to perform at his banquets. Komurasaki in particular was the main target of Orochi's affections, with the latter wishing to make the former his bride. Orochi's feelings for Komurasaki, however, were very shallow since he only loved her due to beauty. He thought of himself as the only one with the right to have her as a result of his pride and possessiveness. Though arrogant, Orochi avoided being totally overconfident out of fear, as he was a coward by nature. As a highly cautious and attentive man, he took any and all threats to his rule seriously. To this extent, he prohibited the use of weapons and banned all martial arts dojos to deprive any dissidents of the means to incite a rebellion. Orochi also acknowledged the fact that the Nine Red Scabbards and Momonosuke survived, believing his information sources and the fact that their bodies were never found. His warnings about the return of the Kozuki retainers caused many of his complacent servants to view him as a coward, merely overreacting out of fear for Toki's prophecy. Though his servants were often afraid to voice this skepticism out loud, Orochi was aware of the fact that he was thought of as paranoid, but overlooked this due to having the authority to have his commands carried out regardless. Orochi remained resolute in his refusal to release the prisoners in Rasetsu Town despite Yasuie convincing people that everything was a result of Orochi's mistake, going as far as imprisoning their families alongside them if they attempted to protest. Ironically, while he was careful with the Kozuki Family and the rebels, Orochi could be too trustful as he never suspected his subordinate Kyoshiro of being affiliated with either the Kozuki Family or the rebels and never expected Kaidou's betrayal. Despite his usual cautious attitude, Orochi could make rash decisions in the heat of the moment as he was willing to execute Yasuie in a public demonstration, without taking into account the latter's popularity with his citizens and the potential to arouse their dissatisfaction by killing him. According to Hyogoro, despite all the precautions Orochi took to minimize the chances of his own downfall, he had failed to notice the great flaw in his policy of condemning all his dissidents to life imprisonment in Udon, which allowed hatred to breed among tens of thousands of people for over two decades. Having lived in safety and protection for twenty years with the help of the Beast Pirates and his countless subordinates such as the Kyoshiro Family, Mimawarigumi, and the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Orochi sometimes lost all sense of danger. When Zoro attacked him, Orochi was deeply shocked that someone had actually tried to kill him despite his authority and power as the shogun. Orochi's unexpected complacency also led him to miscalculate the distances of the regions of Wano due to having spent all his time in the Flower Capital as he acted too late in stopping the rebels from gathering. After being betrayed by Kaidou and having his delusional pride and glory as the shogun completely insulted and humiliated by the latter taking all of his forces through an ultimatum, with the Mimawarigumi and Orochi Oniwabanshu (with the exception of Fukurokuju) pledging loyalty towards Kaidou instead of punishing the latter for decapitating him, Orochi went insane due to his excessive arrogance and anger, hell bent on taking revenge on his former benefactor for his treachery. He still retained enough reason to know that it was impossible to attack Kaidou himself due to the latter's power thus he resorted to arson, setting fire to Onigashima's residence knowing that it would be impossible for the Beast Pirates to escape due to Kaidou levitating the island, though he seemed to forget the fact he was also trapped on the floating island himself. While he believed he could have safely fled the flying island with Fukurokuju's help, he recklessly started his plan to destroy Onigashima and everyone on before getting off himself. He had a habit of using the phrase \"Don't be reserved!\" (, Kurushnai?), an expression used in historical context by people of high social status in response to their servants. Like other characters, Orochi possessed a unique laugh: \"Gufufufufu\". He also used the variations \"Gufuhahaha\" (?) and \"Guhoho\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As shogun, Orochi had full control over Wano Country and its inhabitants. He had government officials working under him who enforced his rule, and had a group of elite ninja known as the Orochi Oniwabanshu, as well as a squad of samurai known as the Mimawarigumi who served and protected him without question. He also had the backing of Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors, so if he and his subordinates were threatened, Kaidou would hear about it and deal with the threat, which was proven in the past when Kaidou brutally ended a massive rebellion staged by countless samurai led by the daimyos serving the Kozuki Family against Orochi's new rule. He believed that with Kaidou's support, not even the Marines and Celestial Dragons could overthrow him or topple Wano. However, with Kaidou having betrayed and attempted to kill him, Orochi lost much of the power that came from their alliance as well as many of his subordinates. In terms of personal combat, Orochi had very little skills to speak of, having always relied on others to protect him and fight his battles."},
{"name": "Kurozumi Kanjuro", "episode": "Episode 700", "chapter": "Chapter 629", "year": 2013, "note": "His full name was revealed in Chapter 974.", "appearance": "Kanjuro's appearance matched the stereotype of a traditional Kabuki performer. He had bright long red hair down to the floor with the front hair sticking outward and down to his chest, with big lips and blush marks on his cheek in a similar manner to Bentham. He was rather tall, standing at 347cm. He wore a traditional samurai outfit with a ribbon in the middle and zori for footwear. On his back, Kanjuro carried a large brush which he kept in readiness for use with his powers. As a retainer of the Kozuki Family, he bore the crest somewhere on his body.", "personality": "According to Orochi, due to Kanjuro being raised in the theatre, his main purpose in life was to act as someone else. Due to his parents dying during the persecution of his family, Kanjuro wished to avenge them and then die. Kanjuro played the role of a loyal retainer to the Kozuki Family so that he would eventually be killed with them. In his role as a Kozuki retainer, Kanjuro acted quite selflessly, since he encouraged Kin'emon to leave him behind and pursue Momonosuke. Kanjuro was also very calm and level headed, as he reprimanded Shinobu for being too rash in resolving unexpected setbacks. However, there are times where he can act absent-minded, such as when he created a net for the citizens of Dressrosa to climb up the old King's Plateau, not knowing they were aiming to capture Usopp and King Riku. He also fooled around during the escalade of Zunesha's leg and failed to realize that Bariete was falling towards him, hitting Kin'emon and him and making them fall off the elephant. He also acted overzealous at times. For instance, when he realized he put Usopp in danger, he stated he would cut open his own stomach as compensation. However, he quickly decided against such actions when Kin'emon told him not to. However, due to his complete loyalty to the Kurozumi Family, he did not develop any genuine attachment to the Kozuki Family despite all the moments they shared together. Once Orochi ordered him to drop the charade and bring Momonosuke to Onigashima, Kanjuro did so without hesitation, revealing his true identity to those who thought of him as a comrade. He did not show remorse for his actions, even though they caused turmoil to their alliance and emotional pain to the other Nine Red Scabbards, particularly Kin'emon, for betraying their trust and friendship. Upon revealing his true nature, Kanjuro showed to be merciless and sadistic. Before departing for Onigashima, he abducted Momonosuke and attacked the Kozuki samurai. He also taunted his former friend Kawamatsu by threatening to kill Hiyori, and mocked his former allies' attempted revolution. When Momonosuke tried to escape, Kanjuro brutally beat him to the point of unconsciousness and casually handed him over to Orochi and Kaidou justifying himself because the boy had cut his hand, even referring to him as a little brat, thereby ungratefully disregarding the kindness and care Oden and the child had showed him. Even worse, while the Red Scabbards held back on him due to their lingering camaraderie, he showed neither reciprocation nor gratitude as he sadistically created a painted clone of Oden to launch a brutal psychological attack against them, while taunting them of killing Momonosuke despite his own wounds. As a Kozuki retainer, Kanjuro referred to himself with soregashi (?), an archaic personal pronoun used by samurai. After revealing his true loyalties, he switches to ore (?), an informal personal pronoun commonly used by men. Like most other characters in the series, he has a unique Laughter Style: \"Ka, ka, ka\"", "abilities_and_powers": "Kanjuro had immense strength, able to easily carry around and use his giant ink brush without tiring, and could equally clash with Kawamatsu, a fish-man with ten times the physical strength of an average human. By imbuing his brush with Busoshoku Haki, Kanjuro was able to help push back and significantly slow down the contraction speed of Doflamingo's Torikago, along with many other powerful combatants. During his journey through Onigashima, he took down several members of the Beasts Pirates with no effort. Even after being cut down twice with fatal injuries, Kanjuro was still able to continue attacking and drawing, although he would eventually succumb to his wounds."},

Due to her Mane Mane no Mi abilities, she could alter her physical appearance into a number of individuals, two of whom being Kozuki Sukiyaki and Oden.", "personality": "Higurashi believed that those with power decided what was right and wrong, and did not view any attempt to gain power as wrong, even if it involved murder. Thus, she was sympathetic to the Kurozumi Family's first attempt to gain the shogunate, and used deceit to help Orochi take the title. Higurashi was very cunning, and would stop at nothing to get what she wants. She was very cautious, having Orochi gather funds and weaponry well before his rise to power, knowing the benefits of those markets in the long run. When she saw Kozuki Oden humiliate himself on the street of the Flower Capital, she cackled with her family members, enjoying their successes. In battle, she did not follow any code of honor, as she disguised herself as Kozuki Momonosuke and with the help of a Beasts Pirate member, distracted Oden with a hostage situation so Kaidou could get the upper hand.

Fifteen years ago, when he was part of the Sun Pirates, his hair was afro-like.", "personality": "Kuroobi is one of the strictest members in his crew and has always been wary of Nami's supposed allegiance to Arlong. Kuroobis attitude is similar to his captain, as he loathes all humans, but does not share Arlong's care for Nami as he dislikes and distrusts the navigator. He even searched her room for evidence he could use against her. Kuroobi does have respect for other people's strength, as seen with Arlong. Though he did complement Sanji's strength by saying he is above the \"average human\", he still mocked the cook for throwing his life away for one girl. Kuroobi is very cruel and unforgiving, as he sliced up Genzo for protecting Bell-mere for trying to rescue Nami, and later he mocked Sanji, saying he was too \"weak\" to protect Nami and his friends (though Sanji proved this wrong by defeating him). Kuroobi will take every advantage he can get in battle. During the Arlong Park battle, he punched Sanji through a wall when the latter was not focusing on the fight and tried to attack a weakened Zoro from behind. Kuroobi took advantage of Sanjis attempt to save Luffy by diving into the sea and promptly tortured the cook underwater due to his fish-man-enhanced ability while submerged.

During his stay on Gecko Islands, he wore a black suit with two golden markings on it over a white shirt with a curious collar, with spiral-like protrusions on the edges, and a standard black tie. He also sports striped shoes (which he apparently kept from his life as a pirate). He would loosen up the tie and collar on the night before the planned raid on Syrup Village. During his time as a pirate, he wore a standard black captain's coat with a red interior and the Black Cat Pirates' symbol on the epaulets. Under the coat he wore a simple white shirt and a pair of black pants reaching down to his knees along with his trademark shoes. Kuro is always seen wearing round glasses that tend to slip off. Despite requiring Kuro to routinely push them back into place, they are nevertheless his signature belongings, as he rejected a more fitting pair from Kaya. Luffy shattered the lenses with a punch in their fight, while the final headbutt bent the frame.", "personality": "Kuro is an extremely intelligent man (holding the second highest IQ in East Blue, behind only Benn Beckman), whose plans have never failed in the past. He is a master strategist and an accomplished fighter, but he was severely hampered by the fact that he simply did not have the patience to deal with a pirate's life on the run from the Marines. He came to desire a life of luxury and peace, giving up his infamy and name in his attempt to achieve it as he concluded he was not suited to be a pirate. Despite his intellect, he has a tendency to underestimate his opponents based on their seemingly harmless appearance, as he believed that Usopp and the Straw Hat Pirates were no threat, which became his downfall. His confidence in his plans tend to lead him to be reckless as well, as he believed that since the pirate attack was nigh, he saw no reason to restrain himself from his feral instincts by needlessly attacking Merry, thus resulting in the surviving Merry to report to Kaya of Kuro's true intentions. Kuro seems to be very proud of his plans, which had never failed before (hence his nickname, Kuro of a Hundred Plans). True to his epithet in both figurative and literal meaning, he conceived many well thought out plans and would achieve them by all means. When he relived his moments of piracy, he claimed his plans were too great to be wasted on his crew. Because of his pride within his plans, Kuro is intolerant of any failures on his subordinates' part, and would kill them if they were to hinder his plans in any way, even if it was due to bad luck as opposed to incompetence. He valued his plots to perfection, as he refused Kaya's negotiations for leaving the village alone in exchange for handing over the estate and fortune he desired, insisting the attack and her death must occur for the sake of his plan. During the final moments before Luffy defeated him, Kuro lost his composure and screamed at the despair of his precious plan failing. He also seems to like the glasses he wears very much, even though they tend to slip down his nose every so often. He pushes them up with his palms so he does not scratch his face with his Cat Claws, a symbol of remembering his murderous ways. Even after the lens were shattered by Luffy's punch, he kept them on. The glasses are his signature belongings, and, as such, he destroyed the new ones Kaya gave him (though it may be because he simply hated her). Kuro, being selfish and arrogant, is very cruel and diabolical towards everyone else, be they ally or enemy. He held himself in very high regard, having a standard for people no one but himself seemed able to live up to. He felt nothing for the lives of others, willingly sacrificing anyone he needed to achieve his ambitions. During his three years as Kaya's butler, he acted as a benign, trustworthy and well-manneredyet slightly snobbishman who carries a hatred for pirates, and as such, looks down on Usopp. He later admits that, aside from his hatred for Usopp and piracy, how much he despises this pseudo-personality; his hatred of piracy notwithstanding, the true reason is very different than that of his false persona. Kuro has proven himself to be a skilled actor, having created the personality of Klahadore, which was in stark contrast to that of his true persona, Kuro; he managed to maintain his act despite his deep hatred of Kaya and Usopp, enduring them with crocodile tears and verbal taunts, respectively, only revealing himself when he deemed it was no longer necessary. He differentiates his two personalities via his tone of speech: as Klahadore, he uses the formal pronoun \"watashi\" (?) to refer himself, while as Kuro, he uses the more arrogant \"ore\" (?); the anime furthers the two personas by \"Klahadore\" speaking in a lighter and a very formal tone while \"Kuro\" has a deeper and much colder voice. His sudden change in personality induced great fear into Merry and Kaya. Kuro has proven himself to be quite a hypocrite. While discussing his plans regarding Kaya with Jango, Kuro would avoid using the word \"kill\" due to believing it to be barbaric, referring to her planned death as an \"accident\" to make it sound more civilized. Once his true intentions came to light and his patience with his crew waned, Kuro bluntly stated that he would kill, even directing such cruelty to Kaya when she confronted him. He later revealed that he never intended to let his crew leave Gecko Island alive despite his earlier claim that three years of inactivity had softened his heart (hence giving his crew five minutes to redeem themselves). Stating how much he detested piracy due to his belief that they are simply buffoons who robbed and killed out of greed and self-gratification, he has proven himself to be no better due to his plot to take everything away from Kaya while reveling on killing all the villagers. Though able to restrain himself most of the time, to the point of appearing to be a civilized person who abhors senseless violence, deep down Kuro is a very bloodthirsty man, using death and brutality as means to punish any subordinates who failed him or even stand in his way during his attacks; this trait comes to full effect upon seeing a crescent moon, which drives him wild and even he finds it difficult to resist the temptations of violence brought on by the stage of the moon. During his time as an active pirate, he was open about his murderous nature, as his crew feared him for his ruthlessness at all times. On the night of the Marine attack, there was once again a crescent moon, which seems to have been the reason why Kuro was so brutal to the Marines on board. Even after yearning a peaceful life devoid of the needless violence associated with piracy, Kuro still found the sight of a crescent moon an irresistible lure to his old ways, leading him to unnecessarily attack Merry simply to satisfy himself; his habit of pushing his glasses up with his palm instead of his fingers, whether as a pirate or butler, is proof that he has not forgotten his killing methods. His desire for retirement did nothing to curb his enjoyment of killing, as he reveled on the thought of killing Kaya and Usopp for money and revenge, respectively. As a consequence, during the first opening of the anime a red crescent moon can be briefly seen in the scene with Kuro.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kuro is feared by all his subordinates, all of whom obey him out of his well-known ruthlessness to both foes and allies alike. Despite the Nyaban Brothers believing that his skills dulled over the three years as a butler (something he admitted) and trying to kill him, he proved that he was still superior by easily overwhelming them at the tip of his claws. He also considered Zoro as \"soft\" in comparison for not successfully killing Buchi in one strike. Having achieved a bounty of over 10,000,000, Kuro was considered to be one of the more powerful pirates of East Blue's average standard of 3,000,000."},

He wears gloves that cover all fingers but his thumb, and resemble an afro. He has a large black afro on his head, and three small ones on his beard. He is of medium height and normal weight. He wears a shirt that's orange in the middle and white on the sides with light yellow buttons, along with orange shorts. He has hairy legs, and black boots with white laces. Overall, Kuromarimo resembles a boxer.", "personality": "Kuromarimo is selfish and arrogant. He carried out every order Wapol gave him, including capturing the doctors from all over the kingdom. He thought that conscience did not serve the politics of his own kingdom and for this reason, he laughed at hearing Dalton talk about his meeting with Vivi. Despite this, he is extremely loyal to Wapol and worried about him, like when Luffy threw him into the sea. He is a great lover of alcohol, and often encouraged Dalton when both were still officials to have a drink with him instead of addressing problems within the kingdom. Kuromarimo was able to work very well with Chess, since both shared similar characteristics and ideas. Compared to Chess, however, he proved more lenient towards Dalton after his rebellion. In fact, when he went to visit him in prison to persuade him to apologize to Wapol, he merely mistreated him a little.", "abilities_and_powers": "As magistrate and administrator of the Drum Kingdom, Kuromarimo had considerable influence over the king and great authority over the people. He temporarily lost these privileges after he fled with Wapol, only to regain them once he returned home. He also held an important role within the Bliking Pirates."},
{"name": "Kureha", "episode": "Episode 134", "chapter": "Chapter 81", "year": 2000, "note": "Also known as Doctorine.", "appearance": "Kureha is a slender woman whose exceptionally advanced age shows in her well-wrinkled face. She dresses in a style more suited to women one-seventh her age. This includes a navel ring, a shirt that bares her midriff, a purple blazer and purple low-riding pants. She has a pair of small sunglasses that, when they are not over her eyes, she wears on her forehead even when she is using glasses. She wears bracelets and rings on her left hand. In the past, she wore her hair in bunches with pink ties. Her pale yellow shirt had an alternating solid green line and purple dotted line pattern. During the Drum Island Arc, she wore pants with a pink design on the left leg and a blazer with a yellow line along the shoulders and down each arm. She wore a white shirt with a pink cherry blossom on the front and green sleeves and borders. When Dalton informed her of the Straw Hats' bounties after Enies Lobby, her blazer and pants were solid purple. Her blazer had a fur collar and trim, and orange shirt with a thin bull-head silhouette. Her belt buckle had either a sun or flower design on it. After the time skip, she does not look different from two years before. Her blazer had an orange flame pattern along the bottom and on the edge of the right sleeve. Her pants had the same pattern on the left leg. Her shirt had a top hat in front of an X (likely representing Hiriluk and Chopper respectively), which is the symbol of the Isshi-100. She was later seen wearing a shirt with a heart. In the Levely Arc, Kureha wears her blazer and pants, similar to her time skip outfit. She had a white shirt that said WANTED 100, a likely reference to Chopper's bounty.", "personality": "Dr. Kureha has often been called a witch for several reasons. The first is her eccentric treatment of patients, going as far as violently threatening them if they do not follow her orders. The second is her forceful method of checking for injury, for example, deliberately prodding the ailing area, causing her patients pain and then having Chopper knock them out as a form of anesthetic. The next is her age, 'only' 141. The final reason is her reclusive nature. She hates being called \"old\" or a \"hag\" and her response is generally to punch or kick the offender across the room, and often begins conversations by asking if whoever she's speaking to wants to know the secret of her youth. Kureha seems to have a drinking habit, judging by the bottle of plum sake (, umeshu?) that she always keeps close at hand. Kureha is extremely strict when it comes to healthcare, as she reprimanded Chopper for ignorantly poisoning Hiriluk, telling him that a miracle drug to cure all diseases does not exist and that medical knowledge and skills are what is truly necessary to save patients. When Nami stubbornly insisted on leaving despite not having fully recover, Kureha threatened Nami, saying she could only leave if she fully recovered or died. Kureha takes utmost pride in preserving her supreme health and constitution in her prime despite being a centenarian. She would frequently misunderstand people asking her for the secret of her youth during conversations as shown with Nami and later with Wapol at Mary Geoise. Thus, Kureha takes great offense to people calling her old or any term directly related to being called an elderly and would violently assault them in retaliation as shown with Sanji and Luffy. Kureha is also sometimes referred to as being a pirate because she takes whatever she wants as payment for her medical treatments. She apparently likes pickled plums, as stated by Dalton. Despite her cold demeanor, she does have a loving side to her personality, as she considers Chopper a son and was gravely depressed when Dr. Hiriluk died. Kureha also appears to be incredibly thoughtful, carefully deducting Luffy having the initial D would make him a dangerous man, and being able to correctly say the Pirate King's real name as Gol D. Roger rather than Gold Roger. She then showed some familiarity with the Will of D., which made her the first person in the series to mention it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Dr. Kureha possesses genius skills and immense medical knowledge as one of the finest doctors in the world. Her understanding of medicine and the art of healing is exceptional even among the medically advanced doctors of the Drum Kingdom, living well beyond the normal human life expectancy unaided while also retaining an immensely robust health at the same time. She managed to create an antibiotic to cure Nami when she was bitten and infected by the ancient tick, Kestia, which was thought to be extinct, and as such, the cure would be difficult to find. She is also one of the few doctors around the world authorized to use the highly restricted drug, NHC10. She passed on many of her skills and knowledge to Chopper, who became a great doctor in his own right. After establishing a medical academy, she taught and trained at least eighty students who became skilled enough to join the Isshi-20, expanding their members to a hundred under her leadership. She is also extremely good at telling temperatures, deducing Nami's exact temperature simply by poking her forehead with her index finger."},

{"name": "Kumadori", "episode": "Episode 375", "chapter": "Chapter 264", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Kumadori is a very tall man, standing exactly twice Nami's height pre-timeskip. He also has massive hands, a huge mane of pinkish hair, and a right eye that rarely seems to be open. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of mie poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of kabuki actors. Also, in one of the covers of CP9's Independent Report, Kumadori is shown to have four scars: two large ones on his torso and a pair of smaller ones on his left arm. Like other CP9 agents, he wears a black suit, black pants and a black shirt, but he also wore flip flops with green socks, a green tie, and hand guards covering the backs of his hands that were tied around his palm. As a CP-0 agent, he wears the same suit but the only difference is the color being white. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kumadori has been wearing his kabuki-style makeup since his youth and had his left eye closed instead of his right.", "personality": "Kumadori is, overall, an eccentric character, perhaps the most within CP9. He seems to honor the samurai code of honor very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even the faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses Tekkai, unintentionally saving his own life in a rather comical way. He thinks \"real men\" shouldn't cry or give up, which is why he kept fighting, even when confronted against Chopper's monster form. Kumadori also tried to keep Chopper from crying and from giving up because of his ideals. He also seemed to be the most obedient and dutiful of the CP9 agents as he was the only one who intervened to help Spandam while he was attacked by Franky and knocked the cyborg away from his superior, though he also ironically sends Spandam crashing in the process, causing him more injuries. Kumadori resembles a character in kabuki (traditional Japanese theater). He is a very loud character, and often punctuates his sentences with a loud, dramatic \"YOYOI!!\" He has a strange way of speaking, talks rather slowly and tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. He also has a penchant for spouting haiku, even during battles and at other inappropriate times. He often makes references to his \"mother in heaven\", Kumadori Yamanbako, then begins to sob, even while fighting. Before killing his opponents he often asks them to visit his mother in afterlife and tell her that he is okay. He claims her \"divine protection\" is the reason for his failure at committing seppuku. However, according to Oda in SBS Volume 44, his mother is still alive. Kumadori claims to be a sennin (?, a type of hermit in Japanese folklore who can control even their body's autonomic functions, as well as live forever), which explains his ability to suddenly gain or lose weight by controlling the digestion and absorption of food, and the ability to control his hair. He was also fond of his fellow CP9 agents as he helped raise money to pay for Lucci's treatment after his fight with Luffy and enjoyed spending time with his comrades at St. Poplar.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a full-fledged agent of CP9, Kumadori possesses great superhuman strength, with a Doriki of 810. His fighting style consists of combining his martial arts with his staff and bodily manipulation skills to increase versatility and destructive powers. After two years, Kumadori grew stronger as the World Government saw fit to reinstate him and promote him to CP0."},

{"name": "Krieg", "episode": "Episode 45", "chapter": "Chapter 21", "year": 1998, "note": "He was first mentioned by a Marine in Chapter 44. He was formally introduced in Chapter 46.", "appearance": "Krieg is a large, muscular man, with purple-gray hair and distinct sideburns. During his encounter with the Straw Hat Pirates, his hair was clipped short, and a thick layer of gauze wrapped around his scalp (presumably stemming from his injures on the Grand Line, as his wanted poster indicates he once wore his hair long and wild). His attire features many fur-lined elements. The most notable aspect of Krieg's appearance is his golden armor, which is fur-lined like the rest of his attire. Consisting of a full-torso carapace, massive shoulder-plates (each emblazoned with his Jolly Roger), and arm-guards, it is Krieg's main offense and defense against his foes. It is loaded with a variety of weapons. Under those, he has a brown shirt, and his hands are covered by a pair of fur-lined gloves. He has a golden gas mask somewhere inside the armor, to prevent his deadly MH5 gas from affecting him. On casual occasions, his armor and mass is hidden behind regal attire consisting of a fur-lined coat (which seems to become his cape when he reveals his armor) over a yellow vest with black spots-like motifs. Around his thick neck there is a big golden chain. He retains his pants and shoes even after taking off his clothes for battle, due to his armor not covering anything below the waist.", "personality": "Krieg showcases the typical attributes of a militant leader, favoring cruel and oppressive tendencies using a huge arsenal of weapons and overwhelming odds. He is incapable of any sense of honor nor can he be sympathetic for anyone. Krieg is characterized by cruelty, dishonesty, and arrogance. He is confident in his own superiority, despite any failures he might experience, and believes wholeheartedly that his armada and arsenal of weapons can overcome any foe. Even in the face of his obvious inferiority, Krieg refused to accept or learn from his mistake, instead turning to underhanded methods to get by and believing that there was some sort of trick to overcoming such foes. Witnessing Dracule Mihawk's devastatingly powerful swordsmanship, Krieg accused him of simply having a Devil Fruit power. Krieg has also proven to be very hypocritical as he chastises his crew for taking offense to Luffy calling them weak saying only a weakling is offended by words, but becomes angered himself when Luffy directly says he doesn't have what it takes to be King of the Pirates. However, his constant victories and reliance on weapons and odds made him overconfident. His superiority complex makes it very easy for him to lose his temper if his orders are not fulfilled, usually taking it out on his subordinates. This led to his failed attempt to conquer the Grand Line, believing his reputation built on sheer numbers and military weapons were enough to get him by; he suffered an utter defeat when Mihawk almost completely annihilated his entire fleet. Krieg lives up to his nickname, \"Foul Play\", as he believes in winning above all else, and will stoop to any level to achieve it. An example of this was flying a white flag of surrender and posing as Marines to get the drop on them. Due to his philosophy, he considers concepts like pride and sympathy to be pathetic, and will go to any lengths to win, resulting in his willingness to kill subordinates who display such emotions, disregarding their loyalty and strength. He has no attachments to either his crew or his ships, immediately preparing to rebuild his fleet with the various pirate crews scattered in East Blue instead of mourning the loss of his previous one, and plotting to sink his own flagship to get a new one due to the damage it has incurred. His lack of morale led him to ungratefully assault the Baratie when they gave food to him and his starving crew, intending to take over their ship and kill all the chefs who remained. Intolerant of failure and loss, Krieg lost all hold on his composure when Luffy defeated him, and stood up to demand a rematch despite his critical injuries. Krieg keeps his crew together using fear. Despite how mad and ridiculous some of his orders may seem, his crew will follow them out of fear of death, which is another factor that limits their strength. Overall, he rules his crew with draconian might and expects utter obedience for his overbearing demands. However, some members, like Gin, have genuine respect for Krieg, while Pearl shares the belief trickery is the key to victory and survival.", "abilities_and_powers": "Krieg was considered (in military strength) the most powerful pirate in the East Blue and had a terrible reputation for his devious and deceptive tactics in piracy. Although Krieg had a lower bounty than Arlong (especially with the fish-man bribing the Marines to keep it low), his fleet of 50 ships and over 5,000 pirates, combined with active pillaging, forced the Marines to view Krieg as a greater threat in East Blue. Despite this, however, it was commented by Luffy that Krieg's fleet was not all that powerful. They were just using sheer numbers alone to overwhelm their opponents.[citation needed]"},
{"name": "Kozuki Oden", "episode": "Episode 920", "chapter": "Chapter 910", "year": 2016, "note": "He was first mentioned by Kin'emon in Chapter 817. He appeared as a silhouette in Episode 893.", "appearance": "Oden was a large and very muscular man of towering height, standing in at 382cm. He had long, wild hair of black color that was notably gathered into a large, flat, circular plane at the top, and also included a prominent widow's peak and triangular sideburns. He had relatively sharp, black eyes whose inner and outer corners were marked by black jags going down and up respectively, and above a pair of prominent, highly arched eyebrows. He also wore red eyeliner around his eyes, making them look even sharper. He had a mid-sized, slightly hooked nose, a large, expressive mouth, and a broad chin. Even during his late teen years, Oden looked just like a full-grown man. During his journey with the Roger Pirates, he received three scars, one on his leg, one on his arm, and one on his chest. During the five years before his demise, he grew a short goatee. For clothes, Oden typically wore an orange kimono, leaving most of his legs exposed; the kimono had two yellow crescent moon designs on it. Oden also wore a large purple and white nio-dasuki tied around his shoulders that ran down his back. He would often alternate between this and a similar longer kimono, with his nio-dasuki worn as a belt and tied in the front. Oden also wore his swords, Enma and Ame no Habakiri, across his left waist tucked inside an obi belt. While partying with the Whitebeard Pirates, he wore a light-colored shirt, dark colored pants, and a crown on his head.", "personality": "Oden was an extremely brash, confident, carefree, and self-willed man. This motivated him to commit outrageous and violent actions for his own benefit during his youth and adolescence, such as fighting gamblers in a drunken rage, burning down the yakuza casino after being banned from it, and kidnapping women at night to form a harem in the mountains. Similar to his son Momonosuke, Oden was a pervert as a kid as he was regularly roaming the Red Light District at age 6 and spent the castle's money at the pleasure halls, not to mention forming a harem at the age of 15. However, that toned down over the years as he already grew out of that phase by the time, he became an adult. Overall, Oden was known for getting into a significant number of violent fights, and he cared little for the consequences of his actions, as he gladly stood his ground against the yakuza and the loved ones of the women when fighting broke out as a result of the two aforementioned incidents, making Oden a thrill-seeker, as he always loved getting into fights. Although most men were appalled by his actions, his attitude made him very attractive to women, including the ones he kidnapped for his harem, as they stayed with him willingly, even though they were always free to leave. After being sentenced to work in the quarries, Oden became less selfish and started acting to improve the lives of the Flower Capital citizens around him. However, these actions were just as outrageous and ill-thought-out as the ones Oden committed to benefit himself. The most notable example is when he attempted to help out the citizens during a drought by diverting a river into the city, which caused the city to become flooded. Additionally, when a Mountain God attacked the Flower Capital, Oden quickly went to action to try to deal with it and even took responsibility for causing the crisis in order to shift blame from Kin'emon, who caused the incident on accident. Oden seemed to often mean well but acted in ways that were reckless and potentially alienating to those around him. For example, to honor a deceased man he once knew, Oden cooked a pot of oden soup over his cremated remains to \"share one last drink\" with his former friend, much to the dismay of his mourning family members, although Oden then apologized to them for the disturbance. Unlike the other people in Wano, Oden didn't follow its strict rules and always did things to help others in his own way. He didn't care what others thought about him and also never wanted to be thanked whenever he helped others. Although many men blamed Oden for the Mountain God Incident, they secretly envied Oden for his carefree attitude because he's not bound by Wano's strict rules. After being exiled by Sukiyaki, Oden seemed to have found an outlet for his unconventional attempts at heroism, as he was able to bring peace to Kuri and rebuild its infrastructure in only two years. Oden was also extremely adventurous and wanted to illegally set sail away from Wano Country, viewing it as too cramped. In his youth, he viewed this dream as more important than preparing to succeed his father as shogun. In fact, Oden's determination to set sail was so great that he kept trying to do so 38 times by the time he was only 18. When Whitebeard constantly refused and tried to secretly set sail without notifying him, Oden jumped straight into the sea holding onto the Moby Dick by a chain, shocking the Whitebeard Pirates. Thus, Whitebeard imposed him an extremely difficult challenge which Oden readily agreed to accept it as Oden could brave through the harshest weathers and obstacles without flinching. After he officially joined the Whitebeard Pirates, Oden became immensely excited and curious when they arrived at every new island, learning new discoveries which were unknown to Wano, to the point he ended up recklessly throwing himself into danger. After sailing with the Roger Pirates, Oden became more mature and responsible, and decided that he wanted to succeed his father as shogun and open Wano's borders, to prepare for the return of Joy Boy, and because he wanted to change the entire world. Despite having a first bad impression of Orochi, who Oden considered nothing more than a \"creepy weirdo\", when Oden became a daimyo and Orochi frequently came to him and asked to borrow money from him, Oden always obliged despite never being paid back, doing so because he felt sorry for Orochi and out of respect for his relationship with Yasuie; something Denjiro constantly scolded him for. This makes Oden also a rather naive man as he was easily used by Orochi who approached him humbly and used Crocodile tears, which led Kaidou to call him a foolish lord later on, saying that Oden is mighty, but soft, like Gol D. Roger and Edward Newgate. Because Oden was a honorable man who always kept his word, he believed that Orochi would do the same and honor the agreement that Orochi and Kaidou would leave Wano if he humiliated himself for five years to save the hundreds of hostages and stop the kidnappings and killings of the citizens of Wano. Oden was always someone who would take all the burden on his shoulders as he was afraid that his family and the people, he cares about would get hurt if they get involved, especially after he learned that Momonosuke was attacked, and Toki hit by an arrow. Ultimately, that would indirectly allow Orochi to rise to power and turn Wano into a wasteland. Despite his rowdy behavior, Oden was an extremely compassionate man. While at first annoyed by Kin'emon and Denjiro acting as his followers, he still cared for their well-being and took them in. He also took in other people like the orphaned Izou and Kikunojo, the persecuted Kanjuro, and the lonely Raizo. After subduing the criminals and outlaws of Kuri, Oden chose to reform them rather than execute them as criminals. Oden did not tolerate discrimination, considering it a symbol of ignorance. He saved Kawamatsu, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi from being publicly humiliated and tortured, beating up the ones responsible for it. He also saw the three as helpless children rather than monsters and was amazed by their uniqueness. Additionally, Oden willingly gave up on his trial to join the Whitebeard Pirates when he heard Amatsuki Toki calling out for help, choosing to save her even if it meant he could not join their crew, even though he held onto the chain attached to the Moby Dick for nearly 3 full days and was about to pass the test. When Toki got sick and was forced to return to Wano in the middle of their voyage with Roger, Oden wanted to abandon his dream of going to the last island and instead go back to Wano with Toki and their children, so Toki had to threaten to divorce Oden to force him to continue the journey to the last island. When Oden learned how Orochi abused his power and authority as the shogun by enslaving Wano citizens for his tyrannical greed, including executing an innocent man along with his family for defiance, Oden was outraged and did not blame his retainers for attacking Orochi for the injustice he caused, as he personally stormed into the Flower Capital to execute Orochi himself. When Oden learned from Orochi how his family was unjustly persecuted for his grandfather's crimes and Orochi showed Oden a room full of hundreds of hostages to blackmail him, Oden accepted his demands of dancing naked weekly in the Flower Capital as an apology to the Kurozumi Family in exchange for protecting the citizens from Orochi's vengeance, including saving the hundreds of kidnapped citizens that were meant as a tribute to Kaidou. Oden was extraordinarily humble and impartial. Despite being the Daimyo of Kuri and son of the Shogun, as well as the strongest Samurai, Oden referred to everyone as his equal and despite the deeds and sacrifices he performed to help others, he didn't like getting any credit for them. When Ashura was grateful to Oden for showing him how peace looked like, Oden became annoyed, telling Ashura to stop being creepy. Oden cared greatly for his retainers and the citizens of Wano. He saved the Flower Capital and its citizens from the Mountain God despite the fact that the citizens threw stones at him and insulted him when he appeared. When Yasuie informed Oden about the lawless region of Kuri which even Oden's father considers as the \"cancer of Wano\", Oden became interested, travelled there by himself, and defeated every bandit in there in the span of a night, as well as saving all the innocent people who were still living there. He then brought peace to the hellish wasteland that is Kuri, building a village for the citizens to live in, and a Paradise Farm to feed them. Oden also saved Kawamatsu, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi from people who tried to set them on fire, took them in, and fed them, expecting no credit for it. When Oden and his retainers were short on food, Oden even refused to eat just so his retainers don't starve. When Oden was about to pass Whitebeard's test after holding onto a chain attached to the Moby Dick and having faced the many dangers and climates of the New World Ocean with no protection for three days, Oden heard a woman in trouble and let go to save her, willing to abandon his childhood dream for a stranger. After saving her and waking up the next day, Oden was more thankful to her for treating his wounds, not wanting any credit from her for saving her life from a bunch of kidnappers. An ultimate act of loyalty and selflessness, Oden sacrificed his own pride, honor, and reputation for 5 years to protect and save hundreds of hostages, as well as the entire civilization of Wano from Kaidou and Orochi's tyranny. Oden never explained the motivations for his actions to anyone, not even his wife, children, and retainers, willing to take the truth that he did it to protect and save them all, to his grave. The citizens of Wano who treated Oden like scum for those 5 years learned the truth only thanks to Shinobu, who spied on the deal between Oden and Orochi. In the end, Oden sacrificed his own life for his retainers, willing to go through hellish pain by holding up all of 9 of them on a plank for an entire hour while he alone was getting boiled alive in the oil during the Legendary Hour. Oden's favorite food was oden soup, which he cooked to feed his retainers during his journey around Wano and also after becoming the daimyo of Kuri. Oden was even proud to be named after his favorite food, declaring he was born to be boiled like oden soup as he died in a pot of boiling oil. Oden also loved to drink sake, having started drinking alcohol when he was only 8 years old. Like many other people, Oden had a unique laugh: \"Wahahahaha\" (?)", "abilities_and_powers": "As daimyo of Kuri, Oden had a large amount of power and influence over the region before his death. Being a former member of both the Whitebeard Pirates, as a former division commander, and the Roger Pirates, Oden was a tremendously powerful pirate with great influence on both crews. For several years after Oden's death, Whitebeard kept Oden's spot as the 2nd division commander vacant and noted to Portgas D. Ace, the new 2nd division commander, about the importance and significance of his predecessor, calling Ace arrogant for thinking he could take down Kaidou, a man that not even Oden could defeat. In truth, the only reason why Oden lost to Kaidou was because Kurozumi Higurashi distracted him before he could finish Kaidou off. Oden's strength left a great impression on Kaidou who, even 20 years after his death, regards Oden as one of the few people, such as the Emperors Whitebeard and Shanks, the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, and his former captain, capable of fighting him. His influence even extended toward the members of the Mink Tribe on Zou, with the leaders Inuarashi and Nekomamushi being members of the Nine Red Scabbards. The combination of Oden's tremendous combat skills and charisma earned him a significant reputation with his allies and associates, even post-mortem. The Mink Tribe was so loyal toward the Kozuki Family that all of them were willing to die rather than allow even one of Oden's retainers to be captured. Despite his many conflicts with the yakuza of Wano Country over the years, Oden's death greatly impacted its leaders, causing them to stage an unsuccessful rebellion against his killers. His combat prowess was seen at an early age, when he got into massive battles and altercations with powerful samurai and yakuza and survived, causing a high number of casualties over the years. Despite being frequently pursued by authorities in his youth, he was only captured once and eluded capture many times afterwards. One of his most notable feats was his restoration of peace to the formerly lawless Kuri, where he defeated the powerful Ashura Doji and the dangerous criminals who worked under him single-handedly, rounded them up and got them to work under him, including Ashura. Prior to this, he demonstrated vast skill during his time as a laborer by quickly rising to the rank of a chief stonemason in a quarry. As Oden admitted himself, he had no talent in sailing and navigation."},

His full name and true identity revealed in Chapter 817.", "appearance": "Momonosuke heavily resembles his father Oden (something that Shinobu noted), having a similar facial structure as well as the same long and wild mane of black hair (including on the top of his head which was shaven as an 8-year-old). Unlike Oden, Momonosuke's hair is not styled on the top of his head, being unkempt everywhere, and he currently lacks any facial hair. He is quite tall, with Shinobu and his sister Hiyori (who stand at 180 and 170cm respectively) reaching up to around his chest level. He wears a light-colored kimono with the Kozuki Family crest on it as well as a dark cloak lined with crescent moon designs, which is also a Kozuki symbol. In his prior appearance as an 8-year-old, Momonosuke matched the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a topknot and the top of his head shaven. While his unshaven hair was black like his father's, the portions of his hair that were shaven were turquoise like his mother's and sister's. Due to being a child, Momonosuke was quite short. His typical garb was a pink kimono with peach designs on it, matching his name (\"momo\" means \"peach\" in Japanese), as well as a pair of geta. During the Punk Hazard Arc, Momonosuke wore a red scarf and a purple obi.", "personality": "Due to his upbringing as a samurai, Momonosuke has a prideful and stubborn personality, as he was unwilling to communicate with the other kidnapped children. He also refused to eat any of the food or candy they offered him. Ironically, this attitude is what prevented him from getting poisoned by NHC10. Despite his pride, he also cried when he thought Kin'emon had died. Despite his tender age, Momonosuke is extremely dedicated to the samurai code of Bushido such as benevolence, courage, righteousness, and honor. Having immense compassion, Momonosuke cares dearly for the people of Wano and his retainers as well as other strangers. After learning of Caesar's evil intentions to sacrifice his test subjects, he wanted to warn his fellow captive children about it despite the dangers as he stated it will be shame as a samurai to simply run away. Momonosuke also aided the Straw Hats in treating the brutalized mink citizens of Zou. Momonosuke has great courage and selflessness. When Kanjuro ruthlessly attacked the Kozuki samurais, Momonosuke tearfully pleaded Kanjuro to stop. When he was abducted by Kanjuro, Momonosuke pleaded all of the Kozuki allies to continue their raid instead of rescuing him, telling them to prioritize saving Wano Country from Kaidou and Orochi's tyranny over his own safety despite the imminent danger. Momonosuke is proud of his family as he claims that he is the man who will become the Shogun of Wano Country. He also claims that he is not afraid of anything and even threw a fit when Luffy asked him if he is afraid of heights. However, he is terrified of Doflamingo after having witnessed his cruelty. Despite his pride and stubbornness, Momonosuke did not deny his fear of him. Momonosuke gained his acrophobia after being traumatized by Kaidou, who had held him by the throat, threatening to kill him by throwing him off the top of the Kuri Castle. Before that, he was completely fine with heights, having even traveled to and descended from Skypiea. He was able to overcome his acrophobia after biting Kaidou, the original source of his fear. Momonosuke loves his parents dearly and bears immense hatred and resentment towards Kaidou for murdering them. Momonosuke was also utterly frustrated at his powerlessness for not being able to avenge his parents or protecting his retainers. His immaturity and emotional outbursts initially prevented him from assuming authority, but after being spurred on by Luffy, Momonosuke has begun learning to take charge and fulfill his role as the Kozuki Family's leader. Momonosuke is also very sharp for his age as despite desiring to reunite with his sister, he understands the danger of Orochi learning of her whereabouts and thus opted to search for Hiyori after Orochi's defeat. Despite his pride, Momonosuke also has a humble and modest side as he willingly acknowledged his lack of strength and abilities to avenge his parents. Thus, Momonosuke became dedicated to trained relentlessly in order to be strong and overcome his weakness. He is also deeply impressed with Luffy for being able to convince the Udon prisoners to rise up and fight the Beast Pirates oppression, noted that he could never do the same, though was greatly enraged when Luffy agreed with harsh insults. When the Udon Prisoners bowed before him being elated for his safety, Momonosuke had already realized it was because they saw his father's image in him rather himself as a person. Having long realized his weakness and inferiority to his father Oden, Momonosuke also refused to accept his father's heirloom Ame no Habakiri due to believing he is still not capable enough to inherit it and thus asked Hitetsu to continue to hold on to it. Despite his age, he seems quite interested in older women such as Robin and Nami and has used a combination of fake innocence and flattery to get the women to treat him maternally, allowing him to get away with things for which grown men would be considered perverted. While it initially appears he really is just innocent, the look that he gives Kin'emon, Brook, and Sanji makes it clear that he knows what he is doing, clearly showing an extremely perverted nature on his part. His perverted nature is a trait that he inherited from his father who had influenced him while he was a toddler. Since acquiring his Devil Fruit powers, he has a peculiar habit of transforming into his dragon form whenever he is afraid, such as when Doflamingo was approaching the Thousand Sunny or being presented his father's sword Ame no Habakiri.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the heir of the Kozuki Family, Momonosuke has authority over its retainers, the Nine Red Scabbards. Due to this, he is one of the main leaders of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, which would not have formed without him requesting Luffy and Law's assistance as their equal. As two of his retainers are the Mink Kings Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, Momonosuke also has sway over the Mink Tribe, a race of powerful warriors who are very loyal to his clan to the point that they would die for any member or retainer. As the leader of the Wano recruits of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, Momonosuke technically holds authority over said recruits. It was also mainly thanks to his presence that the majority of the Wano recruits from Udon joined the alliance in the first place. However, being still young, he barely uses said authority, entrusting most of it to his loyal retainer Kin'emon. As the current shogun, Momonosuke has complete control over Wano Country. He restored Wano Country back to its former glory by demolishing all of the toxic factories and the wells for good water as well ceasing slavery for good."},

He wore a light-colored kimono and a dark-colored robe which both had various flower patterns on them. In the present day, he possesses a wrinkly face and long white hair that reaches down to his back. In his Hitetsu disguise, he wears a red tengu mask which has an extremely long nose that grows and shrinks constantly. He wears a black jacket with green poofs along its inner edges over a light gray kimono with purple spots on the bottom. He also wears dark blue puffy trousers and extremely tall geta sandals on his feet.", "personality": "Sukiyaki appeared to be a strict and fair ruler, as he was willing to disown and exile his own son, Oden, for his violent actions. He appeared to be exhausted by and ashamed of his son's ways, calling them demonic. However, Shimotsuki Yasuie believed this was simply a sign of Sukiyaki's tough love for his son and a way to get him to mend his ways. Sukiyaki also seemed to appreciate order, as while he was not bold enough to attempt to establish order in Kuri himself due to how violent it was, he rewarded Oden with the title of daimyo when he brought peace to the lawless region. After being deposed and imprisoned, Sukiyaki was filled with great shame upon escaping, believing he had failed the people of Wano. He was so sorrowful over his failure to the point of considering seppuku, and following the Kozuki Family regaining the shogunate under Momonosuke's leadership, Sukiyaki has no intention of revealing his continued survival to his grandchildren or former subjects, even refers his late son and grandchildren with honorifics sama to prevent his true identity from being known to his grandchildren and the Kozuki retainers. Eventually he chose to reveal his true identity to his grandchildren and retainers on the condition that once he passes down his knowledge to his grandson, he will completely go back to his life of seclusion. As Hitetsu, Sukiyaki retained the same strict attitude, but his caring traits were more apparent especially when it came to his ward Tama. Sukiyaki is immensely protective over her and what little resources she has, and so got extremely violent against Luffy when he mistakenly believed the pirate was taking advantage of her. Later, Sukiyaki took watch over the recently orphaned Toko and brought her to the Fire Festival to cheer her up, assuring her that her deceased father will watch over her. As a swordsmith, Sukiyaki has deep respect for swords and also fellow swordsmiths, as he refused to let Luffy borrow his ancestor's famed masterpiece Nidai Kitetsu, believing it is sinful to handle Meitos so casually, though it is mainly because of Nidai Kitetsu's dangerous nature as a curse sword. He also dutifully safeguarded Kozuki Oden's swords Ame no Habakiri (which he crafted himself) and Enma in order to return them to Oden's heirs, Momonosuke and Hiyori. When he noticed Zoro wielding his creation Sandai Kitetsu and also Shimotsuki Kozaburo's masterpiece Wado Ichimonji, he told Zoro about their origins and about Hiyori's faith in Zoro's abilities which led her to entrust her father's heirloom to him. Sukiyaki is also a collector of beautiful girl kokeshi dolls and was quite proud of his collection; he reacted with loud shock when Robin disagreed with them being cute.", "abilities_and_powers": "As shogun of Wano, Sukiyaki had full control over the country until his rule ended. He was capable of bestowing positions of authority onto others, as shown when he made his son, Oden, the daimyo of Kuri. As a member of the Kozuki Family, Sukiyaki is a philologist who inherited his ancestors' skills and knowledge to read the Poneglyphs and write its language which he passed on to his son."},

She held a strong resemblance to her daughter. A few years later, she received a scar on her left thigh from an arrow shot defending her children.", "personality": "Toki was a friendly and caring woman, as she took care of Oden when he washed ashore on the island she was on to repay him for scaring away human traffickers. Her friendliness could make her somewhat naive, as she went with some human traffickers under the impression that they would take her to Wano, although she did manage to quickly expose their ruse. When she came to 30 years before the present, she showed an excited attitude at going to Wano. After she married Oden, Oden's retainers came to possess tremendous respect for her. She was also humble as she worked with the citizens of Kuri and never boasted about being the wife of a daimyo.", "abilities_and_powers": "As wife to Kozuki Oden, the daimyo of Kuri, Toki possessed a considerable amount of status until Oden was executed."},

During the Battle of Arabasta, he wore a blue scarf around his neck, a dark purple jacket that was going all the way down to his ankles, a white shirt with an ornament of some sort hanging on his neck, black pants and a yellow sash around his waist. After two years he is seen in Yuba reading news about the Straw Hats. He has grown more muscular. He is wearing a short-sleeve shirt with black pants. He still wears the purple-tinted glasses and has desert goggles around his shirt collar. He also has a pistol attached to his belt and pair of gloves on his hands.", "personality": "One of the main characteristics of Koza's personality, which is reflected throughout the Arabasta Arc, is his love for his country, family and friends. He goes through a lot to protect what he values. As a child, he is seen willing to risk his own life to protect members of the Suna Suna Clan. As an adult, he stands for what he believes, leading a whole army with the aim to protect his country. Cobra took notice of his powerful belief in the country since Koza was a kid. When the two met again during the period of drought in Arabasta, Cobra remarked that he has not changed a bit from his childhood, which Koza also admitted himself when he prevented a young boy from joining the rebel army. A natural born leader, he was the captain of the Suna Suna Clan when he was a kid, and later took the head of the Rebel Army. He is seen to be quite influential to others, since he was able to lead an army of 2 million warriors to a battle against the Royal Palace. After the timeskip, he still holds an influential role as Environmental Minister of Arabasta. Courageous, he always tries to protect his friends, his village, or his country when he thinks they are in danger. As a child, he did not hesitate to attack a bandit who was threatening Vivi. This is valued from his friends and followers, who put their trust and love in him. Koza can also be characterized as short tempered and he does not hesitate to break rules if they go against what he considers just. This has led him to rebel against the king, against his father's judgment. However, his motivation is always pure and he only wishes for the prosperity of his country and the well-being of his friends. This is proved by his actions, such as his effort to stop the war between the royal army and the rebels, once he finds out the truth about the Baroque Works conspiracy.", "abilities_and_powers": "Koza has possessed great courage and leadership abilities since childhood; as an adult, he was able to raise and direct an army of millions against Arabasta's reigning monarch, and quell that same army with a single command."},

She has long turquoise hair that reaches her waist and blue eyes that are distinctively slanted at a downward angle. She wears fuchsia lipstick on her prominent lips. Hiyori holds a strong resemblance to her mother. She is considered the most beautiful woman in all of Wano. Her beauty is so unfathomably great, that people can barely look directly at her. Her looks alone are enough to make people faint, go blind, and suffer severe blood loss via nose bleeds. As Komurasaki, she wore geta to make her look very tall. Her hair was extremely adorned, with multiple flowers and pins attached to it. She wore an extremely opulent red furisode kimono that sparkles in the sunlight, with the sleeve adorned with a peacock and flowers on it. She also had red-painted fingernails. She also wears a kitsune fox mask while playing the shamisen so people, and especially Orochi, cannot see her crying in grief and rage. After leaving the Flower Capital, Hiyori left most of her hair down with her bangs covering her forehead while some of her hair is held up by pins in an elaborate bun behind her head. She took out most of its adornments except for one on each side of her head shaped like a pink rose with a gold dangler. She also stopped wearing her outer garment, wearing a pink furisode kimono with purple flower designs along the sleeves and the bottom. She also removed her red nail polish off her fingers.

She claims that this is due to being a daughter of a samurai. This is true even in the face of authority, being unafraid of standing up to and even attacking the shogun Kurozumi Orochi despite the heavy consequences. Because of her pride, she refuses to cry at the thought of reuniting with her brother, stating that as the daughter of a samurai, she must not cry. During her guise as Komurasaki, Hiyori appeared to be a greedy and materialistic woman, as well as a good manipulator. After successfully swindling her victims, she treated them very coldly without any compassion or remorse, saying that she despises the poor. However, it was later revealed that the men she swindled were guilty of highly immoral acts, and she passed all the money she swindled to Denjiro for him to distribute to the poor citizens of Wano rather than keeping it for herself. In reality, Hiyori is an extremely kind and compassionate woman. She is kind to those she is close to, such as her kamuro Toko, and she was appalled when Orochi attempted to attack her, given that she is a child. She is deeply sympathetic towards the many citizens of Wano who had been cruelly oppressed by Orochi and Kaidou. She broke down crying uncontrollably after Yasuie was executed. Despite her kindness, Hiyori has the desire to kill Orochi as she is not afraid to get her hands dirty. While being chased by Kamazo, Hiyori let go of her prideful attitude, pleading for Zoro to help her and Toko. She is very gracious, as she was extremely grateful to Zoro for saving her and made good on her offer to feed him in return. She can be rather careless and timid. She can be a tease, asking Zoro if he was happy to be sleeping with her. Hiyori has a deep love for her country, as she is willing to give up her father's heirloom Enma to Zoro in exchange for Wano's national treasure Shusui in order to return it to the country. Before Kawamatsu and Zoro left to rejoin their comrades to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, Hiyori sincerely bowed to the two, requesting them to do their best in saving Wano from their tyranny. Hiyori loved music, having enjoyed playing the shamisen since childhood. According to Kin'emon, she was a tomboy when she was a child and was quite insolent and brash, a trait she inherited from her father when he was young. Momonosuke stated that Hiyori liked to act tough, but she was quite a crybaby. Even as an adult, Hiyori retained some of her childish personality when she dropkicked her brother, Momonosuke. In her role as Komurasaki, Hiyori used speech patterns typically associated with oiran: She ended most of her sentences with \"de-arinsu\" (?), a polite expression meaning \"to be\", and used the first-person pronouns wachiki () or achiki (). After abandoning the Komurasaki identity, she drops the verbal tic and switches to the neutral pronoun watashi ().", "abilities_and_powers": "Hiyori seems to have great balance and leg strength to walk with extremely tall geta sandals without any strain, although she did have to put her hand on her guard to do so. She also owned a fair amount of arm strength, as she slapped the extremely large Orochi with enough force to leave a mark.

Koby's glasses are still present, but he has adopted the habit of wearing them pushed up on his forehead, occasionally using them for reading. After the timeskip, Koby has grown even taller, reaching Garp's shoulders. He now wears a scarf, a senior officer's Marine coat with the word \"justice\" on it, a merit on his jacket, and a new bandanna. The scar on his forehead also has grown wider.", "personality": "Koby was first introduced as the Alvida Pirates' hapless ship caretaker who lived in fear of both the ship's crew and captain. Two years of forced servitude had robbed him of all hope of escaping as well as his dream of becoming a Marine, leaving him with few goals other than avoiding being bludgeoned to death by Alvida's iron mace. Luffy was less than impressed with Koby's cowardice, describing him as \"pretty stupid and useless...and kinda wimpy too\". However, Luffy's boundless optimism and single-minded pursuit of his dream rekindled a similar conviction in the downtrodden ship caretaker, allowing him to defy his captors, even under the threat of a brutal death by Alvida's mace. As the pair continued in their travels, Koby remained timid and cautious, often relying on Luffy to perform dangerous tasks and becoming alarmed by his companion's reckless behavior. He was also shown to be perceptive, noting that it was \"strange\" for the citizens of Shells Town to be afraid of a Marine Captain and telling Luffy that he had \"a bad feeling about this.\" Koby's nave belief in the blanket integrity of the Marines was dashed when he witnessed the actions of Axe-Hand Morgan and his son, but it only strengthened his resolve to become, in his words, \"a real Marine.\" Under Garp's instruction, Koby's timidity has been replaced with confidence, although he remains polite, self-effacing, and apologetic if he feels he has done something overly ambitious (such as publicly stating his goal to become a Marine admiral). He continues to be an emotional, compassionate person who can easily be driven to tears for a variety of reasons, which led to Zoro jocularly calling him a \"crybaby\" during their reunion at Water 7. Koby does not act with the reckless bravery that many characters in the series exhibit, but rather on moral compunction. He has put his life on the line at least twice for the sake of what he feels is right, most notably at the Summit War of Marineford where he brought fighting to a standstill by facing down Admiral Akainu and bought the precious seconds needed for Luffy to escape Koby has an immense amount of determination. In the early days of his training as a Marine when he was still weak, he would trained relentlessly non-stop by punching battleships which could only be done by powerful Marines such as Garp and Kuzan due to acknowledging his lack of fighting talent. Despite his already exhaustive training session with Garp, he continued to train on a daily basis despite his hands would keep bleeding from the injuries. For all he has done and is capable of doing, Koby is rather humble, as he denied Kyros' claim of him being a hero during the Rocky Port Incident and did not claim credit for stopping a torpedo that was aiming at the Dressrosa and Prodence Kingdom ships. He felt ashamed for thinking Marines had come to rescue him and considered it thinking that the world revolved around him when trying to escape from Hachinosu, and was shocked when he discovered they had come for him.", "abilities_and_powers": "In his first appearance, Koby lacked any fighting skills, let alone even above-average physical prowess. According to Alvida, the only reason she kept him around was because he happened to be good at navigation. He gained some fighting skills after he trained under Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp, alongside Helmeppo, learning the Rokushiki, surprising Luffy and Zoro from the amount of growth he'd undergone. After the two year timeskip, Koby reached the rank of Captain, granting him command over lower-ranked Marines and charge of his own ship. In addition to this, at some point he became a member of the covert Marine squadron SWORD, who are granted enough free reign to take on missions normal Marines could not, including challenging any of the Four Emperors. At some point, he became regarded as a \"Hero\" because of the Rocky Port Incident, somehow assisting the Emperor, Blackbeard in defeating Ochoku, a former member of the Rocks Pirates and a famous pirate comparable to Shiki and Captain John. During the Marines' invasion of Amazon Lily to arrest the former Warlord, Boa Hancock, Koby was one of the few people to not get petrified by her powers: a notable feat as Yamakaji, Catarina Devon, Vasco Shot, a Vice Admiral and two of the Blackbeard Pirates' Titanic Captains were among the Marines and Pirates to be petrified. After the Cross Guild placed bounties on Marines, his was 500,000,000, most notable as most Marine Captains are worth 100,000,000. He has some knowledge of swordsmanship, as he was seen practicing with Helmeppo and Bogard."},
{"name": "Koala", "episode": "Episode 622", "chapter": "Chapter 541", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "When she appeared twelve years ago, Koala was a skinny girl with long, unkempt brown hair. She also had distinctively large and round eyes, similar to that of a koala, and was always smiling. She had on a dirty, short-sleeved collared shirt, which she wore under dark overalls and a smudge on her right cheek. As a slave of the World Nobles, she had the mark of the Celestial Dragons on her back, which was replaced by the mark of the Sun Pirates by Fisher Tiger. After a few weeks she had neat, shoulder-length hair, a light-colored dress, and a pair of loafers. At age 23, she became taller (though she is still rather short as an adult at 160cm), slim, curvaceous, and has a pronounced hourglass figure. In the anime, her hair was changed from light brown to orange, now matching her depiction in the manga. She wears a crimson newsboy cap with gold goggles, a pink shirt with a frilly collar, a maroon short skirt, and black thigh-high stockings with brown high heeled boots.", "personality": "Aladine described Koala as having the lifestyle of a slave ingrained in her blood. Even after being set free for three years, she was very apologetic and vowed to never cry or stop working. The pirate explained that if a slave ever cried or stopped cleaning, they would be killed. Koala seemed to consider the Sun Pirates her masters, as she asked them if she would be killed if she stopped cleaning. Aladine also said that slaves panicked constantly, even when alone, and that they couldn't trust anyone. It is unknown if Koala also became paranoid in that regard. When Fisher Tiger convinced her that his crew were not like the Celestial Dragons by throwing his gun into the ocean, she finally cried for the first time in years. She then began to regard the Sun Pirates as her family rather than her masters, though this did not stop her habit of cleaning even when she was not asked. By the time they reached her hometown, she genuinely liked the fish-men and mermen of the Sun Pirates, creating especially strong bonds with Hatchan and the future members of the Macro Pirates. She went as far as to actually hold Fisher Tiger's hands despite him trying to shake her off. At the age of 23, Koala has become much more mature, having shown sympathy towards Sabo for not being able to save Ace, telling him he should not let his guilt get to him. She has also become rather playful and cheery, having gleefully hugged Robin after meeting her and also teasing Sabo about him crying upon meeting Luffy again. She has also been shown to have a temper, as she got angry with Sabo for fighting Fujitora instead of staying at his post and comically pinched his cheeks for his disregard for his duties as a Revolutionary.", "abilities_and_powers": "She has been shown to have certain skills like being able to take down larger enemies and great agility and can make a big jump from the stands to all the way down to an underground port while bringing Sabo clothes to wear. Her position indicates that in terms of combat, she is above simple revolutionary soldiers, as she seems to have a decent level within fish-men standards despite being human."},

He has small eyes, a very long and pointy nose, a very long handlebar mustache, a mouth full of sharp teeth, a large tongue, and two rather small arms that cannot even reach across his body. During Luffy and Cracker's battle, the top of Kingbaum's head was cut off, removing most of his branches. When the Big Mom Pirates' army attacked the Straw Hats, Kingbaum was bisected vertically by Amande. However, he was later stitched back together. After being struck with Big Mom's \"Ikoku\" technique, Kingbaum lost the upper left corner of his body, just before reaching the eye but after reaching the left arm, down to the waist. After suffering a direct hit from Prometheus, Kingbaum was left burnt char black.", "personality": "Kingbaum takes his duties very seriously and will ensure that all intruders in the Seducing Woods are killed. He carries some pride with his position, viewing outside assistance as unnecessary and being confident in the abilities of himself and his subordinates. He is the only homie so far to not fear Charlotte Cracker; like other homies, however, he fears the power of a Vivre Card containing Big Mom's soul. He has a habit of adding the suffix -ju to the end of his sentences, which is a reading of one of the kanji for \"tree\" (?). In the English dub, Kingbaum is given a faint German accent, while including flora-based puns into his speech.", "abilities_and_powers": "As master of the Seducing Woods, Kingbaum has authority over all the homies and other people stationed in it. Under his command, no intruder had managed to leave the Seducing Woods alive, with the exception of Urouge and the Straw Hat Pirates. He was able to survive even with the top part of his head cut off horizontally, with no apparent impediment on his viability; only when Amande fully sliced him vertically in half did he diethough even this was not final, as he was able to be resurrected once his two halves were stitched together. The scar did cause him pain, but he was able to continue running without any impediment. Jinbe noted that traveling on Kingbaum was faster than running themselves."},

For the size of his abdomen, he has rather short, skinny limbs. He also has brown hair that comes to a peak at the top. He wears a standard prisoner suit with black and white horizontal stripes.", "personality": "When he was locked in Level 5 of Impel Down, Kinoko was negative to any possibility of running away from the Great Prison. He tried to convince Luffy to accept his death, stating that wanting to save someone else is just an absurdity. After being freed, he was revealed to still be wary of strong opponents, like Marshall D. Teach. Kinoko is also gullible, believing Buggy to be a powerful savior because he stood up to directly addressed two Emperors when, in reality, Buggy was a friend of emperor Shanks.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kinoko was recognized by the other inmates on Level 5 of Impel Down as a very powerful man, so much so that he was considered the boss of their cell. Furthermore, since he was kept on a floor where only those prisoners with a bounty of 100,000,000 and higher were locked up, this further confirms his power. During the Summit War of Marineford, Whitebeard commented on how strong Buggy's convict followers were, deciding not to make enemies of them during the conflict. Being recognized by an Emperor like Whitebeard is a testament to the prisoners' strength, of which Kinoko was included."},

{"name": "King", "episode": "Episode 925", "chapter": "Chapter 918", "year": 2018, "note": "He first appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 920.", "appearance": "King is a towering man at 613 cm tall, with a well-muscled, broad-shouldered frame and long limbs. Being a lunarian, he has his race's telltale features: large, black-feathered wings on his back that reach down to knee length, a brown complexion, and silver-white hair. Said hair is shaved on the sides but kept long on top, where it is mostly drawn back and bound at King's occiput before flowing freely down past his nape; some sidelocks hang down on the right of King's face, to his collarbone, and include a thin braid. King's face is characterized by his narrow red eyes, prominent dark eyebrows, a straight nose, prominent lips, and a square, stubbly chin. Circling halfway around his left eye, on its outer side, is a black tattoo resembling a laurel wreath or olive branch. In addition, a plume of fire constantly rises from King's upper back, also owing to his heritage (though it may extinguish), and when King transforms into a pteranodon, these flames further engulf his back and wings while his natural lunarian wings are replaced by his pterosaur ones. When being dealt the finishing blow by Roronoa Zoro amid the conclusion to their fight, King had half his right wing sliced off. In order to hide his lunarian identity, King keeps himself clad in a dark, form-fitting leather uniform that bares no skin. Covering his head and neck area is a full-faced leather mask, which leaves only two holes for his eyes and has a zipper going up the front of the neck, flanked by two blue, gray-studded leather bands. The mask around the eyes is black, with a trio of blue strips below (also beset with studs) forming a triangle to mark off the nose, mouth, and chin section, and to the sides of which is blue leather of flame-like shape. Topping the eyes are blue-lensed, gray-rimmed goggle pieces, and on either side of the mask, connecting with a studded base, is a large and black, horn-like spike. Five more such spikes, only smaller, are located further on top upon a blue band that runs coronally into another one positioned like a headband, and crossing yet another that goes sagittal, with airholes in-between. Otherwise, King's upper-body wear includes a dark-blue, double-breasted leather jacket that has ten gold buttons and notch lapels with square, red, gold-edged skull patches sewn on. Running straight down each side of the jacket's waist are two columns of yet more studs, and flat, two-part shoulder pads (black and double-trimmed with studs) are present on each side, down the upper arms with three curved spikes atop (the outer spikes the biggest). The tight sleeves of the jacket are cuffless, end in black gloves, and each bears an additional, stud-covered pair of leather bands above thinner strips, plus three very small, white spikes above the wrists. Below the jacket, King wears a white shirt whose ruffled neckline emerges from under the jacket's lapels. For lower wear, King dons dark-blue pants matching the jacket, with three studded leather bands wrapping around each upper leg and a ring of the same material located on either knee. The pants go inside black, high-heeled boots (once again tied with studded straps), the high shafts of which end folded over, in studded jags. As a young boy, King had already begun keeping his hair longer and swept to the right. At one point he wore a light-colored shirt patterned with alternating dark squares along the borders, plus dark shorts and light boots, and wielded a plain, qing-like spear that featured a leaf-shaped blade with a short tassel lashed below. Years later while held in World Government captivity, a teenaged King had already grown very tall by human standards, reaching up to an adult Kaidou's waist. His hair was at roughly neck length, his wings were proportionally smaller (their lower end reaching only to waist level), and King's fire was already present at his back, as was the tattoo around his eye. King's clothes at the time consisted of a light-colored shirt and dark pants, and he already seemed to be equipped with a flaming sword. Years following his recruitment by Kaidou, King had already begun attiring himself in a version of his current leather uniform, being seen with his mask off while in the company of Kaidou. Twenty years ago, King wore a version of his uniform that, in the anime, is shown to have had a dark-red coloration as opposed to blue. King's spikes atop his mask were shorter, blunter, and he wore his jacket's collar upturned without white ruffles visible. The jacket's front had just one row of buttons, with two golden cross shapes right there that either served as oversized buttons or were simply patches. Also in the anime, King was seen carrying a blue-flamed torch.", "personality": "King is a stern, reticent man who keeps a level head in most situations, rarely showing strong emotions (though this is partly attributable to his face being perpetually masked). Like Queen, King tends to be very denigrative towards crewmates, such as frequently insulting and deriding his fellow All-Stars for perceived failures. In keeping with his status as Kaidou's right-hand man, King has shown himself to be not only calm and stoic but proactive and good at making major decisions under pressure. He personally engaged Big Mom and her crew to keep them from entering Wano, despite not being ordered to do so by Kaidou, and later in Big Mom's presence showed himself not to be intimidated by her in the slightest, despite his surprise at her survival, bluntly refusing her offer to join her. King also took the initiative to summon the Tobiroppo after hearing Kaidou was looking to address a problem with Yamato, acting conniving by framing the summons as one from Kaidou due to knowing that the Tobiroppo would not answer to him. When Kaidou became occupied with fighting during the rebel invasion of Onigashima, King was mainly the one to handle their crew's troops, calmly issuing orders. Strongly averse to the idea of showing his face and revealing his lunarian identity, King wears a head-enwrapping mask that leaves only his eyes visible; it was stated by a grunt of the Beasts Pirates that no one had ever caught a glimpse of King's face. When his mask took some damage in his fight with Roronoa Zoro, King flew into a silent rage, indiscriminately attacking enemy and crewmate alike (even his fellow All-Star) before taking care to relocate his battle with Zoro to someplace that had no one else around but them. Once King's mask was off completely and some close-by underlings of his recognized him as lunarian, the All-Star mercilessly disposed of them with his flames. Ultimately, however, King takes some pride in the biological strength of his race, boasting to Zoro that humans could not compare to lunarians. King has a sadistic side to him, having been called a \"torture-loving pervert\" by Queen (though likely in reference to his leather getup). In general, King appears to share Kaidou's streak of ruthlessness, having shown himself to be not above executing a child when demanding that Sanji hand over the eight-year-old Momonosuke for him to kill, in accordance with Kaidou's New Onigashima Project. He also had no scruples about personally dispatching turncoat subordinates who, in fact, had been brainwashed into betrayal. Likewise, while loyal to his crew, King has no qualms about betraying long-standing allies who stand outside their direct organization, especially if so doing is pertinent to Kaidou's plans, and so lent his sword to Kaidou so he could decapitate their ally Orochi whom they had played friendly with for over two decades. King seems to greatly respect strength in others, with Kaidou's immense power being what originally induced King to join his crew and place his trust in him. In combat, King has expressed his belief that one ought not to limit oneself to a single way of fighting, as there should be no need for adherence to any one school or style in a real battle. Generally, while King does admit to enjoying a good duel, the All-Star's stolid and no-nonsense attitude carries over into his fights: he does not bother with posturing, monologuing, or following fighting etiquette. Instead, he wastes no time in going for the kill should an opportunity emerge, personally goes after noteworthy enemies when physically disabled, immediately strikes at foes when distracted, and may relentlessly mount attack after attack on opponents to leave them little time to defend themselves or counterattack. Even more, King may goad enemies into attacking him to render them vulnerable to his own surprise counteroffense. King is among the scant few people who are aware of Joy Boy's supposed nature and, according to Kaidou, is waiting for the legendary figure to appear, with King having at one point speculated that Kaidou himself might be Joy Boy.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Beasts Pirates' head All-Star and Kaidou's right-hand man, King holds authority in the crew that is just below Kaidou's own, exemplified when he took on the role of a commanding officer during his governor-general's absence, informing the Tobiroppo of the enemy's numbers and directing them towards new objectives throughout the raid on Onigashima. In combat, King is shown to be extremely formidable, with his 1,390,000,000 bounty illustrating his fearsome reputation. A veteran pirate, he has been part of Kaidou's crew for over three decades, as his first recruit, and was in his youth acknowledged by Kaidou for having extraordinary strength, being named \"King\" in recognition of it. Like the other two All-Stars, King is also hailed as a \"calamity\" for his sheer destructiveness, linked to his pyrokinetic abilities. Alongside Jack, King was confident in his ability to defeat any of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest fighters of their crew behind the All-Stars and mighty combatants in their own right, if challenged. During the battle on Onigashima, King effectively engaged Marco, Whitebeard's former right-hand man, in single and later (with Queen) two-on-one combat, keeping Marco occupied until he ran out of stamina, all while King remained none the worse for wear. Later, King proved himself more than a match for Roronoa Zoroone of the Straw Hat Pirates' top fighters who had proven capable of injuring Kaidou himself. As King went toe-to-toe with and consistently overwhelmed the enemy swordsman in their duel, Zoro came to believe that, unless he figured out King's background, he would not be able to win. However, once Zoro had managed to figure out the secret of King's body and the means by which to hurt him, the swordsman was able to deal a decisive blow to the All-Star and defeat him. Having a strong will, King was completely unaffected by Zoro's Haoshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Kin'emon", "episode": "Episode 656", "chapter": "Chapter 580", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 664.", "appearance": "Kin'emon's appearance matches the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a black topknot and goatee. At 295cm (9'8\"), he is taller than Brook who stands at 277cm (9'1\"). He is also quite muscular. His eyes are asymmetrical, with his right eye opening more than his left. His attire consists of a samurai gi that is black and white striped on the left side and orange on the right. Kept on the left side of his torso is a pair of katana with identical flame-patterned sheaths. For footwear, he wears simple geta sandals. He has the crest of the Kozuki Family tattooed on his back. Over 25 years ago, he had blonde hair and did not wear it in a top-knot. It was only after Kin'emon became a proper samurai that it started resembling his current hairstyle.", "personality": "During his youth, Kin'emon was a rather brash and rude thug who partook in thievery and assault in order to get rich quickly. He was irresponsible with money, frequently falling into financial debt due to endless gambling and stealing from his childhood friend, Tsurujo. At the time, he was seemingly fine with dying, ignoring Tsurujo's advice to leave his involvement with the yakuza and find a normal job otherwise he could get killed (he happily claimed no one would miss him). Still, he had a conscience, which acted once he witnessed the chaos and destruction caused by the Mountain God due to his actions, especially after learning that Tsurujo, who had backed him all this time and suffered from the troubles he caused, had fallen victim to the gigantic beast. He was going to confess for his crime until Kozuki Oden stopped him. Kin'emon already showed great courage and a desire to protect those dear to him in his early years, something that earned him recognition from Oden. After witnessing Oden taking the blame for the Mountain God Incident, Kin'emon became a devout follower of the shogun's son, claiming that he would die for him. After being encouraged by Yasuie to reform himself for Oden's sake, Kin'emon adopted a proper samurai etiquette and a very old fashioned manner of speech. Due to his reformed outlook, Kin'emon now expects women to walk three steps behind men and talk gracefully and quietly. He, on many occasions, referred to Nami as a shameless, violent and obscene woman due to her careless behavior and felt disgraced when he got hit on the head by her. Kin'emon seems to follow the code of bushido, claiming he would commit suicide if he could, for the shame of being dismembered without dying. Even after being completely dismembered by a \"mysterious ability\", Kin'emon still maintained his pride as a decapitated, talking head. Like Momonosuke, Kin'emon is very stubborn, constantly refusing the help of others and claiming he does not need it, while also denying conditions like hunger and pain out of warrior's pride. Only after nearly freezing to death did he finally forsake his pride and ask for help. Kin'emon is greatly honorable, bowing before Sanji for saving his torso (which was separated from him at the time) and thanking him for his help, stating that he was now indebted to him. As shown by his constant refusal to accept help from Sanji and own claims, he holds a strong dislike for all pirates. This is most likely due to his master Kozuki Oden's death at the hands of Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates. Similarly, Kin'emon once stated that he cannot stand the sight of dragons due to Kaidou himself being a dragon Zoan Devil Fruit user, considering them detestable creatures and violently harming one at Punk Hazard as a result. He also seems to be very quick to judge things, believing Zoro to be the one who robbed Ryuma's grave after seeing his sword Shusui, a national treasure from his country, sheathed at his waist. Kin'emon has a tendency to be quite perverted in spite of his sexist ideals. Though he seemed to be outraged at Nami's sense of fashion, he still greatly enjoyed ogling at her cleavage and has used his own Fuku Fuku no Mi to manifest revealing outfits for her to wear. He showed his anger and jealousy at Momonosuke bathing with Robin and sleeping in the same bed with the women of the Straw Hat Pirates. Since Oden's and Kozuki Toki's deaths, Kin'emon now dutifully serves Kozuki Momonosuke, heir to the Kozuki Family, protecting him from any harm or threat. Kin'emon cares deeply for Momonosuke, traveling to the dangerous Punk Hazard island and challenging the Warlord of the Sea Trafalgar Law in order to find his young master. Even after being chopped to pieces, Kin'emon's torso and legs still attempted to search for Momonosuke and attacked anything that got in the way. When Kin'emon learned that Momonosuke could have been left behind during an escape sequence, he recklessly rushed through a mass of deadly gas just to rescue him, with little regard for his own safety as a demonstration of fierce loyalty. By his own admittance, Kin'emon is the type of person who does not give up easily when it comes to a certain matter. He was adamant in making Ashura Doji their ally once again, despite the bandit's initial refusal to join Kin'emon's cause. To this end, Kin'emon was not above framing him for stealing from the Beasts Pirates. However, after being confronted by Ashura, Kin'emon realized this error and that he was ignorant of the suffering his comrade had endured for the last 20 years. As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon knows how to take charge in times of war and rally his soldiers to victory. Still, he may think of himself as smarter than he truly is, which can lead to embarrassing situations as others praise his accidental leadership and strategic feats. Kin'emon seems to have no knowledge of Devil Fruits, which he considers a form of sorcery (including his own). The same applies for stranger, unusual abilities, classifying them as either ninjutsu or the work of a creature from folklore. He is also unaware of other modern things that are commonplace outside Wano, including dishes like pizza.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon has a certain degree of authority among the group. As such, he is an experienced leader who can take charge during a crisis and is capable of successfully rallying soldiers to war. The other Scabbards appear to respect Kin'emon as a leader, most notably Denjiro. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his dragon form. Before becoming a proper samurai, Kin'emon was nothing more than a thug who assaulted and stole from people, but his strength and reputation were already recognized by even Hyogoro, the most prominent yakuza of the Flower Capital. One of Kin'emon's more unique capabilities is his ability to speak through farting. This was convenient since it allowed Kin'emon a certain method of communication after getting cut up by Law at Punk Hazard, as his legs had been attached to a dragon's body while his head remained confined in a cell in the Third Research Institute."},
{"name": "Killer", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Killer is a tall, muscular man. He has long wild blonde hair that reaches down to his thighs. He wears a plain, white and light-blue striped full-head helmet with many rows of holes in it, and what look like modern headphones on both sides. He also wears a black shirt with white polka-dots and an open collar that shows his chest, with blue riding chaps over his pants. Additionally, Killer has a red sash around his waist. He carries a pair of handguards which have very long detachable scythes connected to them. When not fighting, these scythes are placed in a large sheath tied to his right hip. In an SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Killer is shown as a kid with a wavy hair that covered his eyes with a plain t-shirt, pants and shoes, eating a plate of noodles. This makes a reference to SBS Volume 62, that Oda stated that Killer, as an adult, prefers to consume food that can pass through the holes of his mask, such as stick-shaped ones and ramen. After the timeskip, Killer is shown as more muscular and with a thicker neck. He has grown a goatee and is shown to have a prominent scar on his left arm. His hair is shorter, now only reaching down to his back. He has changed his attire after the two-year timeskip to a blue t-shirt with his customized Jolly Roger on. Under the guise as Kamazo the Manslayer, Killer lost his mask and has bandages covering most of his face and arms. He has sharp, slanted eyes with blue pupils. His hair is kept bound, and he wears a red violet kimono with yellow sickle-shaped patterns placed on it irregularly, as well as a dark violet obi around his waist and a cape that both have target patterns on them. By the time of the Fire Festival, Killer regained his mask, although it was heavily damaged during his fight with Hawkins, having received several cracks.", "personality": "Like the rest of Kid's crew, Killer comes across as both mildly arrogant and level-headed, in the latter case, probably more so than their captain. Of course, this does not mean he is not as enticed toward violence as anybody else on the crew. He also remains fairly silent during combat, save for the slicing of his blades, and tends to focus on the elimination of his enemies. Killer is more knowledgeable than his captain in terms of historical facts, as shown when he informed Kid the meaning of the Ox Bell. After the timeskip, Killer has been shown to be much calmer than his captain, advising him to be polite when meeting with his fellow Supernovas, and was then able to prevent a fight between him and Scratchmen Apoo from escalating while reminding them of the purpose of their meeting. He also seems to be more reasonable than his captain, which is in contrast to his name, as he tried to reason things out rather than immediately trying to start a fight. Killer is very caring towards his allies. Though the exact terms are unknown, he was made an offer where he could save his crew by eating a SMILE fruit and working for Orochi, and Killer accepted the deal. After eating a faulty SMILE fruit, Killer lost the ability to express negative emotions and is now only able to smile and laugh. After taking on the alias Kamazo, he displays the traits of a violent man who takes pleasure in killing. If he encounters someone whom he has not been ordered to kill, he will give them the chance to get out of his way but will kill anyone who stands between him and his target without issue. He is very confident in his abilities, constantly taunting his opponents and being sure that they will lose to him. As someone who worked for Orochi, \"Kamazo\" held the shogun in high regard and would get mad if anyone referred to the shogun in an impolite manner. By the time of the raid on Onigashima, Killer started regaining much of his former personality, though he still suffers from the effect of the faulty SMILE fruit. A week after the raid, Killer expresses admiration at General Franky, continuing a running gag that male characters often partake in when they see robots. Like many other people, he has a unique laughter style: \"Faffaffaffa\" (?). According to Kid, Killer hates his own laugh to the point of stopping himself from doing so ever since. Moreover, he also hates people laughing at his laugh and is willing to kill them for it. His favorite food is spaghetti, his mask being specially designed so he can eat it without removing the mask.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Worst Generation, he is a powerful pirate, being the only one (alongside Roronoa Zoro), not to be a captain; where along with him he is also one of the two members who does not have the powers of a Devil Fruit, unlike everyone else. Prior to the timeskip, he obtained a bounty of a 162,000,000 by the time he had reached the Sabaody Archipelago, where he briefly faced off against Urouge, another member of the Worst Generation, with apparent ease. After the time skip, his abilities have increased, where his bounty increased to 200,000,000. He was able to face Zoro, where the latter recognized Killer's power. At the same time, he managed to wound him, albeit with a surprise attack, only to be defeated in the end. Killer himself believed that he could have killed Zoro if he had used his Punishers. During the raid on Onigashima, he earned the distinction of injuring Kaidou, formerly of the Four Emperors and considered the \"The Strongest Creature\", where Kaidou himself recognized his power. He later defeated to Basil Hawkins, another Worst Generation member, where the latter seemed to recognize he could not defeat Killer, so he decided to use dirty tricks. Additionally, Killer has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. After eating a failed SMILE, Killer lost his ability to swim and to show other expressions besides a smile."},

Kikyo discouraged Luffy's presence on the island, especially after seeing the return of Boa Hancock. Of the Kuja at the party after the arena fight, she is the only one not amused at Luffy's antics.

He kept his goggles, but now wears a Galley-La shirt and roller-skates.", "personality": "Kiev seems fairly realistic and down to earth, unlike some of the other members, since he was unsure about stealing Franky's swim briefs to make him join the Straw Hat Pirates. When he met Franky, he came to deeply respect him and called him \"Aniki\" just like the other Franky Family members.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kiev is seen with a sword, its not known how skilled he is.

{"name": "Kikunojo", "episode": "Episode 913", "chapter": "Chapter 899", "year": 2018, "note": "", "appearance": "Kikunojo has a feminine appearance and is noted for her beauty, given her past reputation as the \"most beautiful swordsman in Wano Country\" (, Wano Kuni ichi no biseinen kenshi?). She has indigo eyes as well as long, dark-violet (dark-blue in the anime) hair that falls onto her back, and is very tall, easily towering over the likes of Luffy and Zoro, as well as her brother, at 287 cm. In the present, Kikunojo has taken to wearing sandals and a yellow kimono with chrysanthemum floral patterns and a pink-and-cream-and-lavender obi, white tabi, and black-soled zri. When she prepares for combat, she ties her hair into a ponytail with a red ribbon and rolls up her kimono sleeves with a tasuki, and sometimes dons a white Noh hannya mask. For the raid on Onigashima and the battle against the Beasts Pirates, she wore a full set of Japanese armor. Before being transported to the future, Kiku dressed in more masculine clothing typical of a samurai. After arriving in the future, Kiku began showing a significantly more feminine side, such as wearing red lipstick and dressing more in feminine clothing. During the Scabbards' fight against Kaidou, most of Kikunojo's left arm was sliced off by one of his attacks.", "personality": "Despite her reputation as a legendary male samurai as one of the Scabbards, Kikunojo describes herself as being \"a woman at heart\", and thus lives and presents herself in a traditionally feminine manner. She is a very upbeat and friendly person. To friends, she is helpful and nurturing, as seen when she treated Zoro's injuries and tended to Tama when she was being healed of her poisoning. Kikunojo is shown to be a confident, hardened warrior whose friendly nature translates into a strong sense of justice and desire to protect those around her. This was first demonstrated when she served as an ally to Luffy in his mission to rescue Tama from the Beasts Pirates. Kiku even went as far as to cut off Urashima's top-knot (a sign of great disrespect to someone of the samurai class) after hearing him use dehumanizing language toward a crowd of Bakura Town residents, regardless of the fact that just moments prior the same people had berated her due to low social standing. When Kin'emon contemplated the possibility of one of the Nine Red Scabbards being a spy, Kikunojo rebuked him for being indecisive about the matter and told him that they should identify the spy immediately. Kikunojo's desire to do right can sometimes result in her making rash actions, as she acknowledged when she inadvertently showed her samurai abilities in front of the Bakura Town citizens while living in hiding. Afterwards, she showed more restraint about going to fight enemies, and had to be convinced by Zoro to use her abilities to help save Tama. Kikunojo typically becomes extremely emotional when she loses something dear to her, as she quickly teared up and ran off to be alone after going to the ruins of Oden Castle for the first time since Oden and Toki's deaths. Additionally, she was very emotional when Kanjuro revealed himself to be working for Orochi, and when she reunited with Izou. However, she did not lose any resolve when being grievously wounded herself, not showing any distress after having her left arm severed beyond an initially shocked look and a brief grunt of pain while having her wound cauterized by fire. Kikunojo takes pride in her role as a retainer of the Kozuki clan, and occasionally refers to herself using sessha ( or ?), an archaic pronoun similar to \"I\" in the English language, which is used primarily by samurai (the Viz translation has her refer to herself as \"this one\"). When Momonosuke used the word \"Sunacchi\", Kikunojo quickly rebuked him for doing so as she believes members of a noble family like the Kozuki should not use coarse words associated with commoners.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kikunojo has some musical talent, likely due to being raised in a dancing school. As a young child, she already knew how to play the shamisen."},

He ocassionally seems to be cross-eyed, which makes him resemble a frog.", "personality": "As a pirate, Kibagaeru follows the code of honor quite strictly, as he adhered to the rules of the Davy Back Fight, and joined the opposing crew upon losing, even if it means abandoning his old crew, as well as losing his captaincy. He can be despicable and opportunistic, not caring much for the crew he left behind in favor of joining a bigger one, and in the anime, trying to usurp Foxy's position and kicking him out of the crew along with Porche and Hamburg, Foxy's first and most loyal crewmates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kibagaeru was the captain of the Fanged Toad Pirates, so he possessed authority over his subordinates.

He is also insecure about his height, constantly checking for anyone calling him a midget and will violently attack those who do.

Ace. Likewise, this highlights that Kechatch highly treasures friendship because he charged straight into battle upon orders to save their comrade. Furthermore, his willingness to challenge Marine Headquarters shows that he is a fearless pirate that will not back down even in the toughest of situations.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kechatch is a fearsome pirate who has managed to achieve an infamous reputation in the New World such that he was able to ally himself with Whitebeard.

While it started out doing nothing other than going to the location that Kanjuro intended for it, it did appear as though Kazenbo had a consciousness and personality of its own, as shown by its response to Yamato's attacks. It was shown to have high reverence for Orochi, referring to him as \"Orochi-sama\". Despite this reverence Kanzenbo did not follow Orochi's orders to burn Hiyori, going towards and burning him instead, likely from reaching its limit.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being covered in flames, Kazenbo was capable of burning anything it comes into contact with.

These shorter pants reveal another tattoo on the side of his left leg that says THE GOLD FISH.", "personality": "Kaneshiro was confused after Usopp shot Arlong and announced himself to the fish-man crew.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kaneshiro, as a shipwright, is capable of fixing and building ships. As a fish-man, Kaneshiro is several times stronger than an average human. However, while he is strong, Kaneshiro is a lackey when compared to the stronger members of Arlong's crew."},
{"name": "Kamijiro", "episode": "Episode 914", "chapter": "Chapter 901", "year": 2018, "note": "His name was revealed by Holed'em in Chapter 917.", "appearance": "Kamijiro's entire body consists only of a lion's head, two legs, and a tail growing from Holed'em's stomach. His mane is striped and circular. The tuft of his tail is also striped and is about the size of his head.", "personality": "Kamijiro has a mind of his own, allowing him to act independently of Holed'em. Much like Holed'em, though, he is very violent and quick to anger. However, his rage can sometimes make him act rashly and attack Holed'em himself. It is implied by Holed'em's subordinates that Kamijiro is not very intelligent, given that he does not seem to realize that he and Holed'em share the same body, and thus each other's pain.", "abilities_and_powers": "Though he is limited by only going where Holed'em goes, Kamijiro possesses tremendous strength that assists Holed'em greatly in battle. His legs appear to be quite powerful, as shown when he swiped Holed'em in the groin and caused both of them great pain. His jaw is also extremely strong, as Holed'em stated that he could crush and tear apart Tama easily with it."},

He alsohas two big and colored earrings hanging from his ears. On his back he has a pair of classical Shandia wings associated with their species. Kamakiri wears a grass skirt, similar to the ones worn by his companions, but with a red and green elaborate belt around the waist. He also sports a light red fur vest and a necklace that seems to be made of some animal's claws or teeth. After the timeskip he has only added his guard's coat to his attire having it hanging from his shoulders.", "personality": "Kamakiri seems to be one of Wyper's most trusted fighters and is also good friends with Raki and Aisa, acting much kinder than the other warriors. Unlike his boss, he always retains a calm demeanor.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kamakiri is one of the strongest Shandia warriors, most likely the strongest under Wyper himself. His combat skills were praised by Enel himself, who offered only to Kamakiri a chance of killing him. The God's electricity-made body, however, prevented the Shandia from killing him, and Enel easily defeated him. Kamakiri also displayed incredible resistance, as he was able to continue fighting after receiving an injury from Ohm, and survived Enel's destructive attack."},
{"name": "Karoo", "episode": "Episode 109", "chapter": "Chapter 65", "year": 1999, "note": "", "appearance": "Karoo is a duck of yellow-brown plumage, with black-tipped wings and tailfeathers. Typical of his species, he bears a black band around his bill and stands roughly as tall as the average human; his feet are tetradactyl, with ostrich-like talons (unlike the webbed feet of normal ducks). His default wear consists of a blue-and-white chullo (typically unbuckled), pink goggles, and a large saddle carrying multiple saddlebags. When travelling, he prefers to wear a barrel-shaped canteen around his neck, complete with drinking-straw.", "personality": "For the most part a comic-relief figure, Karoo is generally intelligent enough to grasp most human speech and situations, but often engages in bizarresometimes dimwittedbehavior, up to misinterpreting some of Vivi's simplest commands. As a counterbalance to his headstrong mistress, he is also easily frightened, easily shrinkingif not outright fleeingat signs of danger. At the same time, Karoo is undyingly loyal to Vivi, and by extension both the Arabasta Kingdom and the Straw Hat Pirates. In times of need, he has always embraced this loyalty over any fears, unflinchingly risking his life on multiple occasions, up to and including using his own body as a shield. Karoo's loyalty to his friends has also made him very determined to help in any way he possibly can both in and out of battle. Examples of this include how he helped Luffy and Usopp to defeat the Baroque Works agents in Little Garden, how he arrived with the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops to help the straw hats out of the desert and save Vivi from Mr. 2 Bon Kurei in Arabasta. Despite this, Karoo, like Vivi genuinely cared for the Straw Hats and became very attached to them, as he tearfully parted ways with them alongside Vivi, and has been seen happily keeping tabs on their exploits alongside her as well. When given the opportunity, he can also prove something of a glutton, and has been known to ignore Vivi's orders on conserving water even during long desert travels.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops, Karoo boasts the peak of his species' natural speed and stamina (famed as the highest among all of Arabasta's land creatures) being considered the fastest of the group, and well-trained in carrying and acclimating riders. With only a small supply of water, he can cross many kilometers of desert in less than a day; when pushed to his limits, he has been known to outmaneuver gunshots, and even scale sheer cliffsides with his talons. Karoo's body is also remarkably durable as a whole, as he took multiple beatings from Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine on Little Garden after the pair tried to use him as bait against the Straw Hats and Vivi and failed, and even survived Mr. 5's explosive attacks with surprisingly minimal injuries, to the point that he not only regained consciousness, but actively helped the Straw Hats fight the two of them, as well as Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek despite still being injured. He was also capable of surviving a stampede of fully-loaded warhorsescompounded by a bullet woundcompletely unarmored. His bill, is also quite strong, as he managed to used it to help dig Luffy free from being pinned underneath a mountain by a Giant. His wings, while incapable of genuine flight, are strong enough to keep himself (and a rider) aloft for several seconds if beaten quickly; their pinion feathers are dexterous enough to act as makeshift fingers, and manipulate tools as complex as scissors. Nevertheless, Karoo possesses very little capacity for actual combat, even when directly coordinating with Vivi. At times, he has been known to confuse maneuvers as simple as charging a stationary enemy."},
{"name": "Kalifa", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Kalifa is a tall, slim, and curvaceous woman with blue eyes and glasses. Like Kuro, she often pushes up her glasses. Her strawberry-blonde hair was about shoulder-length when she first infiltrated Water 7, and she grew it out over the years she spent undercover there. She kept it tied up in a bun as a secretary, but let it fall freely when she was revealed to be an assassin. According to Vivre Card databok, her height is 185 cm (6'1\"), and her three measurements are B93-W61-H92 (36.61\"-24.02\"-36.22\"), making her breasts a G-cup in Japan. She has small studded earrings and usually wears outfits that reveals her legs and cleavage, much like Nami; something Paulie, who is offended by normal women's clothing, often chided her about while she was undercover. When she was Iceburg's secretary, she wore a yellow long-sleeved jacket, and high-heel boots, but as an assassin, she wore a long-sleeved short black dress over a fishnet shirt and stockings along with black gloves and high-heels. As a CP0 agent, Kalifa's outfit is similar to her CP9's attire as she wears a long-sleeved short white dress over a fishnet shirt, stockings with a garter belt and a white matching cape. When attacking Iceburg's mansion she wore a musketeer mask and a long red cape with red long sleeves, as well as gloves and a light purple cloth over a light orange dress. In the anime, her gloves are dark brown, her cloth over her dress is white and her dress is yellow. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kalifa is shown with dress and glasses. It was revealed that Kalifa was very bookish as a child.", "personality": "While undercover as Iceburg's secretary, Kalifa was shown to be a serious and business-like woman, and was seen to be dutifully loyal to Iceburg, accompanying him everywhere to remind him of his mayoral duties and attacking anyone who approached him without the proper respect. She is known for her trademark phrase \"That's sexual harassment\", which she often uses in entirely inappropriate situations, such as simply having her name mentioned. She is shown to be very bright by the ease with which she anticipates Iceberg's needs, and how well she meets his difficult schedule. She is calm, and tries to diffuse chaotic situations, such as trying to calm Paulie when he was shocked at Nami's revealing outfit. After her true identity had been exposed, Kalifa's personality became sly and crafty, as she enjoys embarrassing her superior, Spandam by accusing him of harassing her, again with her trademark phrase. Despite her initial impression of being completely serious and professional, she became easily flustered during her battle against Nami, such as when she correctly guesses the name of her Devil Fruit. She is rather absent-minded, and somewhat self-conscious about it, mistaking Monster Chopper for Nami and then denying that was ever the case the first place. Kalifa also got annoyed whenever Nami ignored her in favor of Chopper. She is also rather vain, considering herself so beautiful and sexy that she does not need to make her skin smooth with her Devil Fruit power.", "abilities_and_powers": "With a Doriki of 630, Kalifa has a high degree of superhuman strength. She employs a kick-based fighting style when not using Rokushiki or Awa Awa no Mi techniques. She possesses formidable leg strength. Alongside Kaku, she could produce a cutting shockwave powerful enough to cut stone walls while using Rankyaku. She could even match Sanji's kicking power, and her attack speed is fast enough to leave residual images after striking. During the attack on Galley-La Headquarters, her fighting style was strongly intertwined with the use of her spiked whip, but she was not seen using this weapon after she ate the Awa Awa no Mi. It can be assumed that after Enies Lobby Kalifa grew stronger, as not only she was reinstated, but promoted to CP0, which is considered to be the strongest intelligence organization."},

It is not yet shown but she may have the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is one of the basic abilities found in all mermaids and some Fish-Men.

Due to this, several characters, such as Luffy, Sanji and Zoro have mistaken him for Usopp. When he worked for the Galley-La Company, he wore a white cap, a high-collared orange shirt with blue sleeves, jeans and white sneakers. When he was revealed to be working for CP9, he wore a black cap, a black suit jacket with an orange handkerchief in the breast-pocket over a high-collared black shirt, pants and shoes. When invading Iceburg's mansion, he wore an over-sized skull mask with a black fez, and blue robes. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kaku is shown with fluffy hair and a shorter nose (though still long by his age standards) and wore a cap backwards. After the timeskip, Kaku now wears a white variation of his black CP9 attire except for a larger hat instead of a black cap, and he also has a tie. His hair is also shown to have grown slightly longer. As a CP0 agent, he wears a tribal mask with a long beard as well as a protruding shape that fits around his nose.", "personality": "Despite his role as a villain, Kaku is surprisingly honest, even to his enemies and even more so than Fukurou, though he does not seem to take insults well. As soon as his hybrid (giraffe/human) form was mocked, he sliced the Tower of Justice in half, in a rage of embarrassment. He also talks like an old man, as remarked by several characters, despite being only 23 years old. He uses the term \"washi\" (meaning I, though used mainly by elders), rather than ore (also meaning I, a masculine term used by young adults). In the Funimation dub, he instead uses old fashion slang words, such as skedaddle and whippersnapper. After being revealed as one of the Water 7 CP9 agents, Kaku's personality becomes rather cold and dispassionate in contrast to his character on Water 7, where he was mainly seen laughing and smiling. Despite this, he often taunts his opponents during battle, and even ate a Devil Fruit for the fun of it, and exclaimed \"This is fun!\" during his life-and-death battle with Roronoa Zoro. He also seems to place a chance to fight over easy accomplishment of a mission; when Zoro and Sogeking were cuffed together, he wished to help them, so he would not be forced to share his target with Jabra. When neither agent had the key, both agreed that the prey was up for grabs. Kaku showed great sportsmanship after his defeat, where he laughed at Zoro's comment of working in a zoo. He also remarked \"too bad\" when Zoro passed Paulie's message of \"you're fired\" and handed over his key without Zoro having to say a word. He also appeared to be the only one of the four assassins undercover in Water 7 who expressed some regret that he could not go back to the way he had been living for the last five years. Kaku has apparently not changed in disposition after the timeskip as demonstrated by his cold justification for Saint Charlos' attempts to enslave Shirahoshi. He states it is necessary for the sake of global peace and the lower ranking royal families should be wise not to oppose the Celestial Dragons. Kaku has a childish side to himself as well, being openly excited by the futurist wonders on Egghead Island. He admits he always wanted to fight a space monster. When seeing Luffy at Egghead, Kaku is shown to be cautious and very obedient when he tried to tell Lucci to not fight Luffy without permission from the World Government, since Luffy is now one of the Four Emperors.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the second strongest member of CP9 and a current agent of CP0, considered the strongest intelligence organization, Kaku is a formidable and valued agent of the World Government. Kaku can also function as a lie detector. He demonstrated the ability to tell whether something is true or not by feeling a person's wrist and then tell the truth by determining the speed of the person's pulse."},
{"name": "Kalgara", "episode": "Episode 286", "chapter": "Chapter 187", "year": 2006, "note": "He was first mentioned by Braham in Chapter 249.", "appearance": "Kalgara's most striking feature was his long mass of red hair that extended down to his knees. He had red tattoos on both shoulders and, like all Shandia, a pair of small white wings extending from his back. Unlike his descendant who almost always keeps a stoic face, Kalgara was noticeably savage looking, with his wide, crazy eyes and awide, mad grin making him more of a \"demon\" than his own descendant. He also had a muscular heavily built physique. He wore purple laced-leg pants (similar in style to those worn by Native Americans) under a grass skirt.", "personality": "Kalgara was quick to react and a strong believer in traditions of his people. He was hugely mistrusting of strangers. Kalgara's personality changed after he met Noland with many of his outlooks of the world changing alongside it. One particular note was that after seeing his God for what it truly was (a giant snake), he dismisses all Gods including the Skypieans \"God\". A noticeable difference between Wyper and himself is that while his descendant keeps a stoic expression, giving the impression that he takes matters seriously; Kalgara in his first appearance, enjoys being intimidating to intruders, giving a deranged expression of slit-like eyes and wide grin, licking at the prospect of his fearsome reputation. This trait mellows down as he becomes friends with Noland, to the point he is actually crying for his friend to return someday.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about Kalgara, except that he was considered the Shandia tribe's greatest warrior and has been shown to fight on even terms with Noland, and killed a giant snake by himself, demonstrating he was incredibly strong. It should be stressed that both his descendant Wyper,and the pirate hunter Zoro, both notable in their own right for their exceptional strength, could not so much as harm the snake Nola, although she is supposed to be much bigger than her ancestors due to nutrition in the sky and the decrease in the atmosphere. He is also apparently very fast, as he has been known to swiftly dispatch intruders as soon as they appear on the island.

His eyelids are notably dark. He has a pair of dark horns that go up at first but then slope downward about a third of the way up. He has a wild mane of light hair that starts out narrow between his horns but shrouds his backside.

{"name": "Kaidou", "episode": "Episode 795", "chapter": "Chapter 739", "year": 2015, "note": "He was first mentioned by Gecko Moria in Chapter 456. Part of his face was seen in Chapter 693 color spread.", "appearance": "Kaidou is a middle-aged man who cuts an imposing figure due to his extreme height of 710 cm and the bulk of his muscles, making him dwarf normal humans. Overly top-heavy in build, he has a well-muscled torso with wide-set shoulders, thick arms, and somewhat out-of-proportion legs; far less heavily built than his arms yet about the same length (with his feet much tinier than his hands). Kaidou's head, atop his bulky neck, is disproportionally small as well (smaller than his hands) and has a massive pair of gray-white, sharp-pointed horns coming out of its sides, curving slightly to the front, then upward. During his final fight with Monkey D. Luffy, Kaidou's left horn is broken off. He has a longish face with a heavy, hairless brow ridge topping sharp, often bloodshot eyes (parent to small, yellow irises), plus, a hook nose and a large, full-lipped mouth. Kaidou is near-always seen frowning and is moderately wrinkled: particularly prominent being his crow's feet below his eyes, forehead lines, and laugh lines from always sneering. His black hair consists of an unruly, mostly swept-back mane down to his mid-back, which forms distinctly flat, rectangular locks of which some fall down near the front, over his ears, or jut upward. His facial hair is done in a wavy, waist-length Fu Manchu mustache that pairs with a spiked goatee across his chin. Right of Kaidou's defined abs is his only scar: a massive, recessed X-shape whose upper points reach to his pectoral, given to him by Kozuki Oden. Twenty years later, Roronoa Zoro managed to add another scar to Kaidou's chest that runs from the top left point of the first scar to near his left shoulder. A tattoo of dull-red segments resembling reptilian scales, individually bordered in orange, goes from Kaidou's left pectoral down the front of his left arm, ending in correspondence to the wrist with a white (dark in the manga), traditionally shaped skull on the lower forearm. Clothing-wise, Kaidou dons a blue purple, feathered, sleeveless overcoat draped on his shoulders, and below a lavender, tight-fitting, open shirt with long sleeves. He has a black bracelet with golden (dark in the manga) spikes above each wrist. Upholding said shirt is a thick, off-white belt of laid rope festooned with a pair of white, hanging shide in the front. More outwardly from below the rope hang two additional pieces of fabric: rectangular, hemmed flaps (which may be the bottom of said shirt) that each have, from two hemmed holes at their bottom, a short, thick, golden torus chain attached to themselves. Two yellow straw cords are below the shimenawa, serving as waistbands to secure a short, hanging row of thin, red ribbons. Finally, the rest of his lower wear consists of simple, baggy pants of gray-green color, tucked below the knees into simple, black boots. After his battle against the Big Mom, Kaidou is seen wearing a white version of his usual shirt, which exposed the middle of his body. 20 years before the current storyline, Kaidou's Fu Manchu was only chest-length, he lacked his current beard, had much fewer wrinkles, and until his battle with Oden did not have any visible scars on him. While he was already very large and muscular back then, he was better proportioned compared to his current top-heavy build. When he was facing Gecko Moria, Kaidou wore a green-blue, open vest and black pants with a thick metal belt. During Oden's execution, he wore the pairing of a dark-blue, sleeveless leather jacket and dark-blue, tight leather pants, with a belt featuring his crew's Jolly Roger on its big, round, gold-framed buckle, in red color on a dark background, alongside black shoes. Additionally, he already wore his purple coat and spiked bracelets. At the time he was seen, due to the injury he suffered from fighting Oden, Kaidou's chest and abdomen were heavily bandaged up.", "personality": "Kaidou is a merciless, aggressive, and confident warrior who never misses an opportunity to gain an advantage in war. He suffers from bouts of apathy and boredom, harboring a general sense of unconcern for most things including the very nature of the world and the lives of himself and his subordinates. He keeps a grumpy disposition with little pleasure and excitement in his life and is constantly frowning most of the time. As such, he craves excitement and chaos, wanting to start the largest war in the world because he felt it was too mundane. This was true even during his childhood as a soldier under the service of the Vodka Kingdom, with a young Kaidou barely showing interest in anything outside of constant warfare. Apparently, Kaidou always had issues with the world he lived in, particularly the people governing it, of which authority he did not respect due to his beliefs that the true worth of someone could only be gauged in the battlefield. In the past, Kaidou once believed that only he could change the world, supposedly in an attempt to mimic Joy Boy and his legend; however, Kaidou has admitted that his methods and overall goal ended up being far different. Still, Kaidou remains curious about Joy Boy and whether anyone else is capable of taking up their mantle. He also thinks that Joy Boy could be the one person capable of ever taking him down. Kaidou's recklessness, coupled with his apparent inability to die from any execution method, has caused him to make attempted suicide as his hobby. Kaidou overall has a very positive view on death, thinking that it is the moment a person achieves true glory. As such, he admires those who die fighting until the very end, such as Gol D. Roger, Edward Newgate, and Kozuki Oden and acknowledges the impact they end up causing in those moments. Kaidou becomes excited when battling enemies who can actually stand toe to toe with him in a fight, though he likewise feels immense disappointment when they fail to defeat him. Kaidou is a heavy drunkard who loves to drink sake, which causes his mood to change erratically when he becomes inebriated. For example, he quickly went from being melancholic over his inability to increase the number of his Gifters and fulfill his dream of having a crew consisting of only Devil Fruit users to becoming angry and violent, brutally beating his subordinates and cursing Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar D. Water Law. While drunk, Kaidou may become more destructive by accident since he ends up caring little for his surroundings, to the detriment of his own crew and their operations. In fact, Kaidou is such a habitual drinker that he even dislikes being sober at any given time. His drunken mood swings have been exploited in battle as well through a special fighting style known as Shuron Hakke, which, by Kaidou's own admission, is only used on opponents that give him a challenge. Kaidou is greatly annoyed at the number of people capable of Haoshoku Haki, stating that the world does not need so many people who could use it. Like several other characters, Kaidou has a unique laughing style: \"Worororo\" (, Worororo?). A second one of his has been observed as he was drunk: \"Fuhihihi\" (, Fuhihihi?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As formerly one of the Four Emperors, Kaidou was recognized as one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, famed as the world's \"Strongest Creature\". Notably, he has a bounty of 4,611,100,000, which is the highest known bounty of any pirate currently alive and third highest in history, surpassed only by the bounties of the late Whitebeard and Gol D. Roger. As the Beasts Pirates' Governor-General, Kaidou has authority over a massive, 20,000-strong pirate organization, and due to his alliance with Shogun Kurozumi Orochi, he and his crew enjoy authority over and cooperation with thousands of Wano Country's samurai forces serving Orochi. Even during his time as a kid and during his teenage years as a pirate apprentice with the Rocks Pirates, Kaidou was already formidable and, after his captain's fall and the crew's disintegration, only grew stronger throughout his life. Kaidou attempted to take Whitebeard's life, something very few would dare, and subsequently had an encounter with Shanks, and a clash against Big Mom two years later. Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter stated that Kaidou is one of the few people capable of stopping Blackbeard. His strength was also recognized by his fellow Emperor Big Mom, who could not fathom the idea of Monkey D. Luffy defeating him. According to Trafalgar Law, Kaidou could easily kill Donquixote Doflamingo, a world-famous, extremely powerful pirate in his own right; Doflamingo himself, despite his normally always-retained fearlessness, was visibly distressed at the prospect of angering Kaidou. Additionally, Law speculated that his crew, the Heart Pirates, and the Straw Hat Pirates allied together would only have a roughly 30% chance of bringing down Kaidou, though the statement is questionable seeing as at that time, Law was not serious about fighting him. Kaidou defeated two other members of the Worst Generation, Eustass Kid and Killer, along with the rest of their crew, with seemingly no issue and refused to take Law and Luffy's alliance seriously regardless of their victory over Doflamingo, viewing defeating a Warlord of the Sea as nothing special. Kaidou's confidence was later proven to be warranted when he defeated Luffy with a single blow during their first fight. Before the fight on the rooftop of the Skull Dome even began, Kaidou was convinced that only Gol D. Roger, Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, Shanks, and his late captain were capable of fighting him seriously. Overall, Kaidou has been said to have only lost eight battles in his lifetime and has only been injured twice. As stated during his introduction, people consider it a certainty for Kaidou to win any one-on-one battle he takes part in, and even most groups and armies have little ability to take him down. When the daimyos of Wano Country and the Kozuki loyalists rebelled, Kaidou crushed them, and when hundreds of samurai went to Onigashima to attack Kaidou 10 years ago, they were all killed. He faced the Nine Red Scabbards (except for Kurozumi Kanjuro) and Izou (a former commander of the Whitebeard Pirates) by himself, and although he was having issues dealing with them in his dragon form, he easily overpowered all while in his human form (including Inuarashi and Nekomamushi in Sulong form, whose strength at that time surpassed one of his All-Stars, Jack). Kaidou also took on the Gecko Pirates 23 years ago and slaughtered all of them except for their captain, Gecko Moria. Similar to the other Emperors, Kaidou has many underlings and other pirate crews allied with him and can claim self-governing islands as his territories. With Caesar Clown and Doflamingo as his associates, Kaidou created an army of over 500 Artificial Zoan-type Devil Fruit users, known as the Gifters."},
{"name": "Jozu", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Jozu is a big, very muscular, broad-chested, heavily-armored and dark-skinned man, called a giant by Crocodile. Even when standing in a hunched position, he is roughly twice Crocodile's height. He has a long face with black stripe-like patterns for a beard and hairstyle. His legs are relatively thin in comparison to his muscular arms. He appears battle-hardened and has a perpetual scowl on his face. The dark armor he wears and his hair style are very similar to that of an Aztec warrior, with red-bolted dark shoulder pads (the bolts were later changed to gray). On his chest he has a green cuirass, whose front and back portions are connected by metal straps that go over both his collarbones. The cuirass' color was later changed to a rusty red color. Around his waist there is a big, elaborated golden belt, worn over what looks like a green skirt similar to the ones worn by Aztecs, with golden decorations near the edge. He also wears what look like studded, black and gold large-buckled shoes or boots and matching black studded pants. During the battle at the summit, he lost his right arm when Aokiji froze him in a brief moment while Jozu's attention was turned away from him, causing the limb to become very brittle and break off once he fell over. Twenty two years ago, Jozu wore a black tanktop and a red sash instead of armor and had a much thinner neck, but otherwise looked the same as he is today. In the past, when Whitebeard declared Fish-Man Island his territory, Jozu is seen wearing a different tanktop design. When Jozu was a child, he was rather round and chubby. He had stubby little legs, and and sported large black overalls, with round buttons. His hair was still in balls on top of his head, but he had less of it.", "personality": "Jozu is a gruff, fairly quiet individual who tends to point out information to his crewmates. He has been shown as unrelenting to his enemies as he had no qualms in attempting to strike Crocodile a second time immediately after a first hit. He is loyal to Whitebeard and his crew, having protected them in at least three instances. However, this loyalty can be taken advantage of, as Aokiji freezes him the moment he was distracted by Marco being injured by Kizaru. When he was young, he showed a playful side when he noticed Oden and Toki together.", "abilities_and_powers": "As 3rd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu held authority over all crew members ranked lower than commander. An experienced veteran, he has been part of the Whitebeard Pirates for at least three decades, from the times of Gold Roger. Combat-wise, Jozu was one of the most formidable, esteemed men of his crew, able to fight and hold his own against Warlords of the Sea and Marine admirals alike. The very division he led specialized in combat, acting as a vanguard to the rest of the crew. Jozu is also shown to be strong-willed, remaining unfazed by a powerful Haoshoku Haki blast released by the Emperor Shanks."},

He wore a plaid shirt, and surrounding it in the middle was a circle of teeth-shaped triangles. Around that circle was a dark belt with a skull design (the Jolly Roger of the Giant Warrior Pirates) on the buckle. He also wore a fur cape with spiral designs on the shoulders. His legs were proportionally small for someone of his height, and he wore dark pants.", "personality": "Jorul appeared to value warriors, as shown when he complimentedHajrudin for training and aspiring to lead the Giant Warrior Pirates. He was also kind and valued children, as shown when he gave thanks for them during a feast. However, he took the traditions of Elbaf very seriously and was willing to kill Charlotte Linlin, a young child, for breaking them and causing destruction on Elbaf, believing that even children can only be tolerated to a certain extent before their offenses be punishable. He considered her to be a devil in the form of a child, and insisted that his brethren take judgement on her. Like many other characters, he has a unique laugh: \"Zabababa.\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former captain of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Jorul was an exceptionally powerful warrior even among the giants of Elbaf. He was deeply respected as a hero with Hajrudin showing utmost admiration for him.

He has a wrinkled face, and sported a purple cap that matches his judge robes.", "personality": "While he was a dutiful employee of the World Government, Jorge was rather reasonable and open-minded. He was willing to let Tom build the Sea Train, so it can be inferred that he cared about the greater good of Water 7. When the Sea Train turned out to be a success, Jorge became thankful for Tom and was glad enough to grant him a pardon. Spandam described him as a \"sentimental old fool\", who was willing to comply with Tom's last request to turn a blind eye towards his apprentices in exchange of not pardoning him. This showed that, despite Tom taking responsibility for building the Oro Jackson and the bombing incident that day, Jorge still respected the shipwright.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a judge, his decision carries immense weight.

His face looks roughly like Dr. Kureha, especially because of his ever-present bottle.", "personality": "In life, John was such an incredibly greedy and loathsome person that his own crew declared mutiny and killed him due to his ways. As a zombie, John has the personality of a drunkard due to the shadow animating him. He is incredibly lazy, and most of the time, he has a hard time following orders. Because of his drunken personality and constant drinking, he is thus called \"Sluggish Captain John\". In retrospect, his personality as a zombie is a stark contrast to that of when he was alive.", "abilities_and_powers": "During life, John was a member of the very powerful pirate crew, the Rocks Pirates, and eventually made a name for himself when he left and formed his own crew. As a zombie, he was nearly invincible, his only weakness being salt. With his corpse being used by Hogback to create a General Zombie, he probably was a very powerful and feared pirate."},

He also carries awarded medals on his left breast, signifying his important rank and status. He wears a traditional red bicorne hat with the Marine's symbol. Unlike other high-ranking Marines, he actually wears his marine coat with his arms in the sleeves. Underneath that, he wears an orange shirt, simple loose pants and boots. Overall, he appears to be a well decorated Marine. He also wields a katana that fits his size, slung over his shoulder.

His eyebrows always seem to be pointing down to make a scowl, even when he is smiling. He wears a blue hooded jacket with a purple undershirt, tan pants, boots, and a watch on his left wrist. After the timeskip his arms became more muscular.", "personality": "Johnny is happy-go-lucky, much like Yosaku. Johnny tends to be the more serious and occasionally the more honorable of the pair, though he acts silly around Yosaku from time to time. Johnny is also dimwitted to some extent and while he knows much information he seems to be greatly misinformed about many things. This includes rumors of \"Hawk-Eyes\" visiting the Baratie regularly when the actual story was about \"Drunk-Eyes\", to not knowing how to cure Yosaku (and not knowing what ailed him in the first place). Johnny occasionally says that he would lose or had lost by a close margin against an opponent far stronger than he is, such as Luffy or Arlong, indicating some arrogance. Johnny is also very brave seeing how he got ready to attack Mihawk when he fought Zoro. Johnny also stands up for what he believes in, this is seen when he fights Dick the Mountain Whale. He also has a cowardly side to him, as seen when he not only tied up Zoro to prevent him from assaulting Arlong Park, but through his willingness to simply abandon him to the fish-men to run off to safety with Usopp. However, when he is spurred, he is brave enough to go against Arlong and his crew and wise enough to know his action could lead to the villagers suffering. Johnny's bravery was still not enough to defeat the Arlong Pirates, leaving the Straw Hat Pirates with no other choice but to defeat Arlong and his crew on their own. One quirk he shares with Yosaku, perhaps out of pride, is always stating that any fight he loses, he lost only by a hair.", "abilities_and_powers": "Johnny is a swordsman like Yosaku, however they are relatively low in strength and power. When they tried to take on the Arlong Pirates by themselves they were easily overpowered. It is still unknown if Johnny or Yosaku have any special attacks. The only time Johnny showed his true bravery, is when he attacked the Going Merry due to Monkey D. Luffy and Usopp attacking a large rock, which Johnny was taking refuge on due to Yosaku's illness. Johnny had no chance against Luffy but he did do quite a bit of damage to the Going Merry which he ended up fixing. The fight was shortly stopped soon after Zoro realized it was Johnny. Johnny and Yosaku are inexperienced with traveling by sea as proven when Yosaku fell ill to scurvy. However, they are fairly knowledgeable about the world at large, such as information on the existence of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Arlong Pirates; he even identified Momoo as a Grand Line monster upon first glance when the Sea Cow confronted the boat that he, Luffy and Sanji were on, hinting some degree of experience. They are, however, still incompetent and have been known to slip up, such as when they said Hawk-Eyes had been reported at the Baratie when it was actually \"Drunk-Eyes\"."},

As a General Zombie, Jigoro was much more powerful than the average zombie in Thriller Bark's ranks, and with Zoro's shadow animating him, he could perform Three Sword Style and One Sword Style techniques, namely Sanjuroku Pound Ho and Hyakuhachi Pound Ho; consequently, he managed to subdue Nico Robin, a powerful combatant, who acknowledged his power herself.

However, due to her Devil Fruit ability, she can alter her age and thus change her appearance at will. When taking the form of a child, she has similar, although obviously more childish, facial features, and is not as tall nor as buxom as in her adult form. Her outfit consists of a white low-cut tank top that exposes both her midriff and cleavage, along with a pair of orange-and-black striped buckled shorts with long, thin suspenders. She also wears black high-heeled boots which reach up to her calves, with large laces coming from the openings, and a pair of hot pink and dark red stockings with a yellow sun-like motif on them (a pattern seen other times in the One Piece world). The hat she wears is a green Furaerka with a light-green lining. She has an anti-eyebrow below her right eye, bright red lipstick on her lips, and is sometimes seen wearing a brown furred jacket. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Bonney is shown with shoulder-length hair as opposed to her current back-length hair and a rounder face. Her clothes and face are somewhat dirty showing that since childhood she had a huge appetite. After the timeskip, Bonney is shown wearing a black hat (possibly a sunhat similar to Usopp's, judging by the rim) with a brown furred coat or cloak. She also uses pink lipstick as opposed to the red one before the timeskip. During the Levely Arc, she shows to have the same clothes she wore before the timeskip, but replacing her previous hat with one with earmuffs, in addition to wearing her coat. Her white tanktop also has frills among the rim. During the Egghead Arc, Bonney is shown wearing a dark colored leotard bodysuit with a hood, along with gloves, thigh-length leggings, an earpiece and a pair of DOM Shoes.", "personality": "Befitting her epithet, Bonney is an extremely gluttonous person with very poor table manners. She will, for instance, demand more food even though she has not finished her current meal. She is usually seen eating pizza, her favorite food, even when fighting or on the run. While Bonney may have an aggressive temper and acts rude, she displays considerable tactfulness. She knows when to fight and when to prevent trouble, particularly in dangerous territories such as the Sabaody Archipelago. When she saw Zoro attempting to attack a World Noble, she orchestrated a scene to fake Zoro's death, knowing full well that such an action would have led to terrible consequences. However, this sense of caution is overwritten when enticing food is involved, similar to Luffy and Chopper. Bonney also believes in the stereotypical view of what a pirate should be and that they all should follow an unspoken agreement of not creating a stir in delicate situations. The idea of a pirate helping wounded strangers also leaves her dumbfounded, implying she is not familiar with altruism among pirates. Several instances suggest that Bonney has an unforgiving disposition towards those who wrong her, holding grudges and cursing their name occasionally. She swore to crush the Straw Hat Pirates for the chaos they brought to Sabaody and appears to have a gripe with either the World Government, the Marines or the Blackbeard Pirates, blaming one of those parties for an unknown reason. Bonney may not be a pleasant individual, but she is capable of respecting others; particularly her fellow members of the Worst Generation, having shown a keen interest in Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law's exploits. While she was willing to leave her crew behind to escape the Marines alone, her relationship with her father, Bartholomew Kuma, was much closer, as she was heartbroken upon witnessing his brutal enslavement at Mary Geoise and even defended a Pacifista unit that resembled her father, proving she is not completely heartless. Bonney has a severe case of entomophobia, as she fainted from the sight of a whole horde of insects rushing at her. She is pretty vindictive about this aspect of her personality as well, becoming unreasonable and murderous against those who employ her fear against her, regardless of whether or not it was intentional of their part.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Bonney Pirates, Bonney has complete authority over the crew.

He has curly violet hair reaching down to his shoulders and always wears a dark brown mask with orange decorations on it, which covers the upper part of his face but reveals his eyes and his nose. He appears to be based on Luchador wrestlers based on his name and the face mask of Mexican origin. He wears a sleeveless black shirt and a pair of white pants with ruffles coming from the base then reaching up to his knees; he also wears black bands tied around both elbows. Burgess also appears to be always wearing a championship belt, a belt which wrestlers only obtain from winning many matches or to show that they are extremely skilled in wrestling. It is unknown if Burgess obtained this belt from his mastery in wrestling or if it's just there for his wrestler appearance. After the timeskip, Burgess has grown a beard and become even more muscular. His hair has also turned a lighter shade than what it was two years ago. While at the Corrida Colosseum, Burgess dons the traditional gladiator attire of sandals and a loincloth, as well as his trademark belt. In addition, his right arm is armored, with his shoulder being covered by a plate pauldron, all held in place by a harness across his chest. He also wears a pair of black gloves. When he first entered the Colosseum as Mr. Store, he was wearing a light green paper bag mask which has eyeholes in it and the name \"Store\" which is colored aqua-blue and Happy written in black upside-down on the forehead. His regular outfit after the timeskip is mostly the same as two years ago. However, he now wears a vertically striped black and white sleeveless shirt that has the same orange symbol as his luchador mask, and he now wears a pair of brown gloves. In Dressrosa, he also carries a green bag which has swirly patterns on it. During the Egghead Arc, he now wears metal plating over the right side of his skull and jaw possibly due to the injuries he received fighting Sabo. He also wears his original outfit and reduced his beard to a chin curtain for the metal plating on his face.", "personality": "Burgess is brutish and ogre-like, and is also very loud and overbearing. He seems to be overconfident, as he climbed buildings and challenged random people in Jaya, proclaiming himself as the Champion. He also appears to have an intense love of combat, wanting to test his skills out on anyone he finds. He especially enjoys strong opponents, as shown when he found out that Monkey D. Luffy was fighting at the Corrida Colosseum. Despite, or perhaps because of his profound love for combat, Burgess also appears to be a sore loser, unable to accept defeat even when he is critically injured. He is also willing to use whatever dirty and underhanded tactics he can should he or his allies be unable to win in a fair fight, as evidenced by how he joined the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates in their nine-on-one assault against Whitebeard or tried to goad Sabo into approaching him by taunting him about Ace's last request and him not being there to save his brother so he could stab the revolutionary with a hidden knife. He has a much more serious nature than his captain, as he scolded Blackbeard for laughing when they lost the Straw Hat Pirates. However, he seems to have become quite laid-back after the time-skip shown when meeting Monkey D. Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum hallways and letting his captain talk to him. Late into the Dressrosa Arc, Burgess also displayed a ruthless opportunistic mindset, willing to take advantage of Luffy's weakened state to kill him and take his Devil Fruit, despite the fact that Luffy was the country's best chance at saving them from the oppressive Doflamingo. This is further shown when he tried to kill Sabo just to get his hands on the Mera Mera no Mi when he interfered in his attempts to kill Luffy, believing that it was his right to have the fruit. He is also very determined and stubborn as he ignored his injured state and infiltrated Sabo's ship and so he could find the Revolutionary Army's headquarters and managed to stay hidden for days before informing his comrades. After Blackbeard had become an Emperor and began going by the new title of \"Admiral Teach\", Burgess repeatedly forgets to address Blackbeard by this moniker and habitually calls him \"Captain Teach\", prompting Laffitte to remind him several times in the past not to do this. According to himself, he is attached to the crew's raft.

After the time-skip, he has become the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, and is also, according to Gatz, one of the Ten Titanic Captains that personally guard the Emperor, Blackbeard. He defeated every challenger he fought in Mock Town with ease and, after the time-skip, won the A Block of the Corrida Colosseum battle royale within seconds, all without a single injury. His mere presence at the Corrida Colosseum was enough to terrify all the nearby gladiators, mighty warriors in their own right. Based off of his attempt on Luffy's life for the Gomu Gomu no Mi and his conversation with Sabo, he knows of a method of stealing Devil Fruit abilities from others."},

He has a large z shaped scar running from his right temple, through the right eye and across the nose, a light stubble, and several missing teeth. As all Impel Down prisoners, he wears a black and white stripped shirt and pants, which are ragged and torn. He also has chained cuffs on his wrists.", "personality": "As most prisoners, he peruses his freedom and use any opportunity to ask for others to set him free. He is well informed on what's happening in the prison and knows about Portgas D. Ace's imprisonment. However, like most people, he is unaware of the prison's Level 6 and presumed Ace was locked up in the fifth level. Upon learning about Luffy' plan, he ridiculed him for his naivety, showing a realistic yet submissive attitude.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about Goen's abilities.

His head is roughly twice as big as Sanji's. His legs are extremely long that their exact length is practically the height of the car he was in. His hair and beard are white while his mustache is black. Like other World Government agents, Jerry wears a suit, and he has a yellow pin of the World Government symbol on the right side of his chest. He personally wears red gloves that he uses for boxing.", "personality": "As a Cipher Pol agent, he is staunchly loyal to the World Government. While fighting Sanji, he was shown to be foolishly boastful of his fighting capabilities against him; which he belays his men from informing CP9 of his intrusion. Despite his pride in his Boxing skills, he is also devious and not above breaking its basic rules such as using kicks and feign attacks to gain an edge in battle.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jerry is a self-proclaimedboxing champion from Karate IslandinSouth Blue. While Jerry has excellent boxing skills, he has a great disadvantage if he is in a situation where his movements are greatly hindered, due to his height. To compensate in such a situation, Jerry learned Yoga so he could fight in small areas by positioning his legs behind his head. However while in his Yoga position, his normally long reach is hindered due to his legs getting in the way. Overall, from what has been shown, Jerry's strength is above that of normal soldiers, but far below Sanji's."},

He is usually seen licking his sword with a bloodthirsty smile.", "personality": "Like his partner Abdullah, Jeet seems to be ruthless and without mercy, as they bombed a government institution, indicating a severe enmity against the World Government. However, in spite of his ruthless nature, Jeet is also shown to have a strong sense of loyalty, being one of the few Colosseum participants that remained loyal to Usopp in spite of the massive bounty Doflamingo placed on his head, even joining in attacking those that did so. This is further highlighted by his willingness to not only fight alongside Luffy, but attack \"Doflamingo\" head on to protect his new ally, in spite of Doflamingo's own fearsome strength.", "abilities_and_powers": "The fact that he was responsible for the bombing of a government facility and that he also was mentioned as a noted participant at the Colosseum indicates that he has some degree of strength. Jeet and Abdullah seem to use a sort of tandem fighting style. While the bigger, presumably stronger, slower and more intimidating Abdullah faces foes directly while often screaming loudly to get their attention with his longer-ranged tridents, the much smaller, faster Jeet launches a quick surprise attack from the rear, catching their adversaries by surprise."},

His size surpasses that of Jinbe by roughly two to three times, being able to catch and carry him easily. He has flame-shaped tattoos on his forehead and a scar running above his right eye. He often bares his teeth. He has large sideburns that line the sides of his face as well as a long mane that runs down his back. When he was a slave, he wore rags and was often forced by his owners to walk on all fours like a lumbering beast. After his liberation and joining the Heart Pirates, he started walking normally again and switched to a black A-shirt. Like all those who were once slaves of the World Nobles, Bart has the \"Hoof of the Soaring Dragon\" mark burnt onto him, which would forever signify him as \"less than human\", though it's unknown where it is on his body. After the timeskip, he now wears a boiler suit with the crew's Jolly Roger imprinted on it, similar to the other members of the Heart Pirates, and has a full beard in addition to his sideburns.", "personality": "Most of his personality has not been revealed yet, but he seems to be a man of honor and repays his debts as he joined Law's crew, the Heart Pirates, after he was freed from the World Noble. He also seems to be patient and calm as seen at Amazon Lily, the opposite of his usual behavior at the Archipelago or the battlefield of Marineford.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jean Bart is an immensely strong man capable of breaking a bridge with a single punch. In fact, prior to his enslavement, he was a well known pirate captain. Even suffering abuse from the Rosward family did not deter him, thus demonstrating great resilience and willpower (whereas fellow captain slave Devil Dias fled in cowardice, only to get blown up later).

His outfit was changed into a purple suit with a white shirt and a red necktie during the Levely meeting.", "personality": "Like many, Jeep admired the mermaid princess because of her beauty and tried to get his son acquainted with her. He can be easily offended as he got angry when Shirahoshi rejected her suitors.

He wears a green cactus-looking mouth guard, and sports a large sombrero with a red and yellow pattern on the rim and a green cactus on top. During the Colosseum match, he is shirtless, wearing armor on his right arm and a chain around his torso and shoulder. He also wore a large skirt and dark boots. After Chinjao headbutts Jean and knocks off his hat in the process, it is revealed that Jean's head and hair also resembles a cactus. His protector was also broken, and Jean is revealed to have a blocky jaw.", "personality": "Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Dededede\". Jean Ango seems to enjoy stealing things, as he was thankful to Chinjao for providing him so many opportunities to steal weapons. He is also perceptive, suspecting Lucy's real identity.Despite this, while sniping weapons at Lucy, Jean failed to realize he was hitting Chinjaowith the weapons, suggesting that he has keen focus. As a bounty hunter, he enjoys hunting criminals and aims to raise his reputation, apparently having captured many of the convicts who escaped Impel Down with Luffy and also plans to hunt down those who assisted Luffy during the Whitebeard War. He included Buggy in his list of targets despite the fact that Buggy was a Warlord, indicating that Ango disregarded his current status. He does not seem to be very familiar with Haki, as he did not know how Luffy was able to dodge his attacks. Despite this, he does possess a strong enough will to resist Chinjao's burst of Haoshoku Haki.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jean Ango has stated that he is a sniper, but rather than using firearms or other conventional projectile weapons, Jean throws the many weapons he steals, turning the arms of his defeated foes against his new ones. He demonstrates fittingly great strength and precision with his throwing, and despite his large size, is nimble and stealthy enough to rob items from opponents while he fights them. Little other strengths or skills have been shown, but Jean must be confident in his overall might as he entered as a contestant at the Corrida Colosseum. The fact that he can survive the New World with no problem is a testament of his skills, as well as being able to capture escapees of Impel Down. Additionally, Jean has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Haoshoku Haki from Chinjao."},

He possesses white dreadlocks which he wears a flat black hat over. He has a scar on the left side of his face, stretching diagonally over his eye. Like two of his fellow Elders, his outfit consists of a black suit over a dark purple tie and a white collared shirt, as well as black pants. He carries a walking cane. Notably for a World Noble, Saturn has eschewed wearing a resin bubble over his head while away from Mary Geoise, although this may only apply to when he is inside his quarters while sailing.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Saturn cares about the balance in the world maintained by the Three Great Powers and wishes to maintain it. This also includes preserving the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. He knows about the significance of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and was willing to go to great lengths to prevent it from being awakened, even viewing angering one of the Four Emperors as a preferable outcome to avoid such a future happening deliberately sacrificing Guernica, one of his best agents, becoming questioned by another of the elders. When global chaos became unavoidable following the downfall of Kaidou and Big Mom, Saturn was shown to be anxious and sweating as he was left at a loss as to how to respond without the option of covering everything up. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki although due to his high position he is highly diplomatic instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral. Unlike the other Elders, he seems to hold some form of empathy for important people he at least seemed to have met, as he was telling Kizaru it was an unfortunate turn of event that he had to go out and eliminate Vegapunk, though this would not stop him from executing his mission nonetheless. He also found it wasteful that they must destroy the Sea Beast Weapons, but preferred to maintain the Pacifista as a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice. Much like his fellow World Nobles, Saturn has a low opinion of human lives and the captive Cipher Pol agents by extension, comparing them to insects that will merely reproduce regardless of the casualties in the worst-case scenario.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Five Elders, Saturn is one of the few to have the \"highest authority of the World Government\", being the highest ranking of the World Nobles who as a group essentially have the right to do whatever they please. He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the Five Elders is Imu. Saturn's physical abilities are unknown, although the scar on his face indicates that he was in at least one confrontation at some point. The Elders were also confident that they could meet with Shanks, an extremely powerful pirate and one of the Four Emperors, without having anyone to guard him."},

While dedicated to militarism, Jarul is very open-minded as he readily accepted Carmel's claimed ideology in pacifism to engage in commerce instead of plundering. He strongly cherished camaraderie and beliefs, as he mourned the death of his lifelong comrade, Jorul, and noted that had he died a warrior's death, it would have been acceptable, hence could not forgive Charlotte Linlin for killing Jorul in a disgraceful manner.

He also has a wide chin and wears a red earring on his right ear. As with all other World Nobles, Jalmack wears a thick white suit adorned with medal-like knobs on the front. He also added a cape to go along with it. However, since he was not at Sabaody Archipelago, he cannot wear one of the resin bubbles as a helmet, due to the bubbles popping outside of that area. Instead, he wears a rectangular helmet, in order to prevent himself from breathing the same air as \"commoners\".", "personality": "As is typical for a World Noble, Jalmack is cruel and self-centered, looking down on those who are lower in social status than his kind. To this end, he would gladly shoot down anyone who dares defy him, including children such as Sabo. He was also seen with three slaves: one carrying him like a horse and two walking behind him in chains; this shows that he has no qualms concerning enslaving people. However, unlike the other World Nobles shown, he shared his reasoning for shooting down Sabo: the child had raised a pirate flag, which classifies him a pirate and a criminal, and deserves to be killed. This falls in line with the Justice doctrine many Marines have adopted. However, his more important reason for gunning down the small ship was due to it cutting his ship off, meaning justice was just an excuse to make him look more moral than he truly is.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, Jalmack has the authority to do as he pleases.

He has yellow-green skin, a rotund physique with disproportionately short legs and little neck area between his head and torso. He has a wild mane of reddish hair that almost reaches down to the ground. He has a very small round nose and a mouth with large and sharp teeth; his two upper canine teeth are much longer and notably curve to the sides, resembling tusks. He also has a pair of broad, light-colored horns on his head which curve upward like a bull's and point toward each other. The only piece of clothing he appears to wear is a short, raggedy yellow loincloth with a black pattern on it. On the right side of his exposed chest, he has a tattoo of Daiji , which means four. The color scheme first given to Jaki in the Vivre Card databook is completely different from his color scheme in the anime. In the anime, Jaki's skin is pink instead of yellow-green, his hair is blue instead of red, the tips of his horns are dark purple instead of being a solid color with the rest of his skin, and his loincloth is white instead of yellow.", "personality": "Like many of his fellow Numbers, Jaki is a rowdy drunk and was considerably intoxicated when fighting broke out on Onigashima. Like the other Numbers, he has a unique laugh that is based on his name: \"Jakikiki\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a failed ancient giant creation, Jaki has significant physical power to complement his size, as shown by his ability to wield his massive club as well as carry the Brachio Tank V with only one hand.

{"name": "Jango", "episode": "Episode 25", "chapter": "Chapter 9", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "Jango is a skinny, Sandy Blonde haired man who appears to favor of being strange, while wearing flamboyant clothes; as the most notable of these are his red, heart-shaped glasses, which disguise his heart-shaped eyes and matching eyebrows. According to Eiichiro Oda, the striped, beard-like growth on his chin is actually the stem of a mushroom that grew while he was sleeping (Jango having eaten the cap, but finding it so disgusting that he left the rest alone). As Kuro's first mate, he was known to favor a simple sleeveless t-shirt and blue bandanna. After being \"promoted\" to captain, he favored a blue, wide-brimmed hat, olive-green trousers (with similarly colored gloves), and black shoes with tall white socks. He combined these with a simple blue jacket when travelling incognito, but wore a larger, more imposing overcoat lined with ring-like decorations when acting in his \"official\" capacity as captain. Once he joined the Marines, Jango began wearing even gaudier articlesmost notably a bright purple-and-yellow giraffe-patterned t-shirtwith the standard Marine Seaman cap.", "personality": "Jango is a powerful yet somewhat bumbling hypnotist. He is mostly carefree and was fully aware of Kuro's tendency to lash out at even his own crew mates (leaving Jango to feel uneasy being around him). Jango was loyal to Kuro, even knowing his Captain could kill him at any moment and went along with any plans of his. Jango seems to love dancing, often implementing dance moves in his routine, such as moonwalking instead of walking regularly. While in disguise at Mirrorball Island, he recklessly entered a local dance contest, forgetting that he had to avoid attention from the Marines. As a dancer, he was shown to be competitive and passionate enough to win the contest in the end, earning Fullbody's respect in the process. As a Marine, he takes the role of Hina's admirer and Fullbody's friend. While they have become friends through a rather bizarre set of circumstances, Fullbody and Jango have become inseparable and are always together on appearances. Often Jango and Fullbody will copy each other or dance beside each other in sync. Like many characters, Jango has a unique Laughter Style: Uhyahahya.", "abilities_and_powers": "Having been a prominent member and acting captain of the Black Cat Pirates for several years, Jango is decently athletic and possesses some degree of combat ability and leadership skills. In melee combat, he has been seen using long, exaggerated kicks not unlike dance moves. Back when he was a pirate, he had a bounty of 9,000,000, a rather pitiful amount by Grand Line standards, but three times the average bounty in his home ocean, the East Blue. However, despite this relatively high bounty, Jango is not particularly formidable; notably, it took Usopp only one Gunpowder Star to defeat him. It is unknown what (if any) improvements he has made to his overall combat abilities since becoming a Marine, though by the time after the timeskip, he was able to rise through the ranks of the navy, going from a mere Seaman Recruit to the position of Lieutenant Commander after only two years. During the Summit War of Marineford, he proved weak-willed enough to succumb to Luffy's burst of Haoshoku Haki."},

He has long, orange hair and a big beard that seems to connect around his entire face, which somewhat resembled a lion's mane. During his time as a vice admiral, Saul wore a Marine coat like all other higher-ranking Marines. However, after his defection, he discarded it. When he crash-landed on Ohara, he was wearing a black shirt and gray jeans that were a little tattered. Also, as a Marine, he had worn the Marine cap, but upon his defection he exchanged it for a cowboy's hat. While leading a group of Elbaf giants in retrieving books from Ohara, Saul was noted to be wrapped in bandages.", "personality": "Saul was a big and friendly giant who was somewhat shy and timid. While he was loyal to the Marines, he questioned their orders at least twice, which shows that he followed moral Justice over the code of Absolute Justice. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to betraying them, as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a former colleague destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand. He saw the giants of Elbaf to be somewhat barbaric, and did not follow their traditions of fighting to the death. Despite this, Saul trusts them and would lead a group of Elbaf giants to salvage the books that the scholars of Ohara saved. Saul dedicated himself to protect Ohara's knowledge, and trusted Vegapunk enough to allow him to read the entire library. Saul was also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh (Dereshishishishi). He enjoyed seeing others laugh and have fun, as shown when he encouraged Robin to laugh. Like other \"D's\" before him, he was seen laughing before his apparent death.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former Navy Vice Admiral, Saul had command of the lower ranking subordinates, as well as leading a Buster Call along with four other Vice Admirals. However, his defection cost him these privileges. He had experienced the Grand Line and seen Devil Fruit users, so he was not surprised or scared by them at all.

{"name": "Jabra", "episode": "Episode 375", "chapter": "Chapter 264", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Jabra is a dark-skinned man, with a Fu Manchu mustache, a pointed goatee, and long hair braided in a thick queue, that somewhat resembles a scorpion's tail. He also has a scar running diagonally down his left eye. When in his half-wolf state, Jabra has an unusually large tail and snout. He has the kanji for \"wolf\" (, kami?) tattooed on the front of his shoulder. During the events at Enies Lobby, he wore small, pointed sunglasses on his forehead, small hoop earrings, and a black tie over his bare chest. He wore a black tangzhuang, that was white down the middle and always open, but somehow always covered his tattoo when in human form. He also wore a red sash around his waist over black pants and shoes. He basically resembles a typical Chinese Kung Fu martial artist, commonly found in various pop culture and media. As an agent of CP0, Jabra wears the same tangzhuang, but now colored white to match the rest of the unit. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. When he was a child, Jabra already had his scar and resembled a martial arts student.", "personality": "Jabra is extremely competitive and was outraged that both Rob Lucci and Kaku have more Doriki than him, especially because Kaku had been weaker when they had last parted ways. His competitiveness and rivalry with the others often overshadows his rationality, and could be part of his wolf nature to establish himself as the alpha male or leader. As a wolf (or dog) he would find it especially aggravating that Lucci the leopard (or cat) would be stronger than him, given the natural rivalry between cats and dogs. Jabra is very short-tempered, and combined with his superstitions, such as his belief that Devil Fruits are inhabited by devils and feeble attempts at preventing Kaku from getting stronger by eating a Devil Fruit, he often comes across as a comedic character. It is therefore surprising that he's possibly the most rational member of CP9. Lucci, who's always calm and in control, is also sadistic and lusts for battle, whereas Jabra insists that he's a nice guy, and proposes a quick, painless death for his victims. However, in battle, a more predatory side of Jabra apparently takes over, and he howls, licks his lips, and mocks and laughs at his prey. Jabra also seems very interested in eating and tasting his opponents rather than just biting them in his wolf form. Jabra is also commonly known to deceive his opponents, as shown when he tried to lie to Sanji, telling him that Nico Robin was his sister who had been kidnapped by a pirate crew when they were young and given a bounty due to being mistaken for one of the crew, and that he wanted Sanji to rescue her. However, Sanji easily saw through this lie, and took his key while kicking him into the ceiling. He is also proud of his lying, shown when Sanji attempted to escape, Jabra angrily complained that he was the one who was supposed to trick people before moving in to intercept him. Many characters in One Piece have distinct laughs. Jabra follows in this tradition with a long gya at the beginning of his laugh (i.e. Gyaaaa ha ha ha ha!)", "abilities_and_powers": "As the third strongest member of CP9, Jabra was a powerful assassin formerly employed by the World Government. He was skilled enough to effortlessly defeat Usopp and temporarily overwhelm Sanji of the Straw Hat Pirates. He possessed moderate tactical and acting skills, convincing Usopp into believing he was a pacifist, and then using his vulnerability to deliver a critical blow to him. However, these tricks were quickly seen through by Sanji, who noted that his lies were unconvincing. It can be surmised that after two years Jabra grew stronger, as he would be reinstated and later promoted to the exclusive CPO."},

{"name": "Jack", "episode": "Episode 801", "chapter": "Chapter 746", "year": 2015, "note": "He was first mentioned by one of his subordinates in Chapter 692.", "appearance": "Jack is a giant grouper fish-man of massive stature, dwarfing his crewmates and standing taller than even his governor-general Kaidou. Unlike the majority of fish-men, his pale skin is identical to that of a human, making it easy to mistake him for one. While still being immensely muscular, Jack's limbs are disproportionately small when compared to his enormous torso (though their size is greatly increased in the anime, especially his arms). He wears a metallic jaw mask that seemingly disappears when he transforms into his mammoth form, and has a pair of horns on each side of his head. His blond hair is worn in a ponytail and a pair of long braids. He wears a light brown (darker in the anime) sleeveless feathery coat similar to Kaidou with spiked pauldrons on his shoulders, circled by a belt bearing his crew's Jolly Roger. During his fight against Inuarashi, this Jolly Roger was destroyed after being pierced by the latter's final attack. He has bloodshot orange eyes and a veined forehead. He has two piercings in his right ear, and wears spiked pauldrons on his shoulders. He carries a pair of tusks around his neck which are actually sheathes containing his scythe-like blades. His mouth contains puffed lips and pointed teeth like any fish-man but while in his mammoth form he has square teeth. When using Koro on the Minks, he wears a hazmat suit and wears a glass helmet around his head.", "personality": "Jack is violent and short-tempered, as one of his subordinates worried how Jack would react once he learned about Caesar's downfall. He threatened to destroy an entire city should he not get what he wanted, and made good on his word, saying that it was the citizens' own fault because they did not comply. His ruthlessness extends to even attacking children and the elderly. He has even admitted that he has a love for causing destruction, even when there is no real benefit to it. Those who have witnessed Jack's personality in person describe these traits as madness. He is also extremely sadistic, willing to torture enemies in order to get what he wants. He is barbaric and brutal to the point of hacking off limbs and creating terrible bloodshed, only ceasing his carnage when he has more urgent matters to attend to. When Jack attacked the giant elephant Zunesha, he was determined to get to its head and came up with several horrendously cruel things he and his underlings could do to kill it. He is extremely stubborn and unreasonable. When the minks tried to tell him that Raizo was not on Zou, Jack refused to listen to or believe them, and continued to refuse when Inuarashi offered to let him search the island without any resistance to see for himself. This, along with him disregarding his crew's comment that attacking Doflamingo's convoy was dangerous, proves that he refuses to listen to logic, to the point where he actually becomes enraged when someone tries to reason with him, having no patience for civil conversations. Jack's lack of reason makes him very headstrong and reckless, as he decided to attack a convoy of four Marine ships, which were carrying powerful Marines, to rescue Doflamingo. He is not above fighting dirty in order to achieve his goals, as he brought in Caesar's gas weapon, Koro, to annihilate Zou after the minks put up a formidable fight against his forces, simply because he was losing his patience and not because he was in any actual danger of losing. He is also strategic, and desires to use the most effective methods possible to win. Upon his return to Zou, he decided to outright kill Zunesha, the elephant carrying Zou, to destroy the country in the quickest way he could and avoid having to fight the minks again while ensuring they were finished off for good. Jack is very thorough in battle, wanting to make sure his opponents are completely annihilated and presuming that they will return to full strength otherwise. Additionally, he does not tolerate it when his subordinates fail their missions, having brutally punished Sheepshead for not finding Raizo. Despite his brutal and sadistic tendencies, Jack has no love for mindless violence, as he became greatly concerned when Kaidou went on a drunk rampage through Kuri and threatened the citizens that Jack valued as factory workers. He also acts respectfully to those who are not his enemies and have done nothing to annoy him. He can be subservient to those he acknowledges as stronger than him, such as his fellow All-Stars King and Queen, accepting insults from them and only replying with a quiet apology, or outright fearing his general Kaidou. Jack does not appear to care about titles or fame, as he got annoyed with his subordinates for boasting about his position and bounty. However, he is still prideful, as he got angry when he read the news report about his apparent death. Although Jack is normally calm and immovable, he is still capable of feeling real fear if he is vastly overpowered and left in a helpless situation. When Zunesha swung its trunk at him and his fleet in order to repel them, Jack began sweating in fear and watched the massive limb darken the sky above his fleet with his eyes bulging in panic. Jack even trembled in the face of his general Kaidou. Likewise, he was rather apprehensive when Queen brought Big Mom to Onigashima.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates, Jack has great authority over his crew just below his Governor-General. Jack also had authority over the region of Kuri in Wano Country, and its residents greatly feared him. In spite of his great strength, Jack is implied to be weaker than fellow All-Stars King and Queen, who both looked down upon him. Alongside King, Jack was confident in his ability to defeat any member of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of their pirate organization and mighty combatants in their own right, if challenged. Like the other All-Stars, he is dreaded as a calamity. His epithet is named for the fact that when he rampages on an island, it is left in a decaying state like it is suffering a drought. His bounty of 1,000,000,000 indicates that the World Government considers him extremely dangerous and threatening to their operations. He managed to sink two of the four Marine battleships that were part of Doflamingo's escort, and despite ultimately being defeated by the entire fleet carrying Vice Admiral Tsuru, Admiral Fujitora, and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku; Jack survived the battle while only sustaining minor injuries. During the war on Onigashima, Jack also bested several minks in sulong form before facing Inuarashi and Nekomamushi (the two strongest minks in Zou), transformed at the same time, though in the end he was completely defeated."},

{"name": "Jinbe", "episode": "Episode 528", "chapter": "Chapter 416", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Yosaku in Chapter 69.", "appearance": "Jinbe is a large blue whale shark fish-man and the current tallest member of the Straw Hat Pirates. He has a stocky build similar to that of a sumo wrestler and a face that is commonly associated with various Japanese demons such as the oni. His yellow eyebrows and sideburns are distinctly shaped like those found on such demons, in addition to a bulb-like nose and an angular lower lip pointing upwards. He has a lightning-shaped scar that can be seen from his left sideburn and reaching over his left eye which he obtained sometime between Otohime's assassination and meeting Ace. He also possesses two tusk-like conical lower fangs associated with Oni as well; the rest of his teeth from the upper and lower rows are pretty much the same, albeit much smaller. He also has a severe underbite, which makes room for his huge fangs. He has long, two-toned black hair, with two long stripes, colored gold in the manga and white in the anime, coming from the roots over his forehead and trailing down the back, a topknot, and tuft of hair on his chin with a slight green hue. This topknot did not exist during his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, instead his shorter and flowing black hair trails off halfway to a light color concentrated at the back of his head. He kept his chin clean-shaven before joining the Sun Pirates, after which it gradually grew out over time. His hands and feet are also webbed, typical for a fish-man, and his limbs that are somewhat thin in comparison with his enormous girth. His gills (which are pale and pinkish in color) are in between his shoulders and neck. Under his pale red coat (which he swaps for a black one two years later), he appears to be wearing a Coral colored traditional Japanese clothing covered all over with black and white square-shaped patterns with the black and white layers alternating each other (beginning with the black outline from the edge) and ending with a dark square at the middle of each and every one of them. He also ties this attire up with a purple obi like a ribbon around his waist. Jinbe is often seen wearing different traditional kimono of varying patterns: he wore a karakusa and later a floral design during his time as a member of the Sun Pirates; he wore square designs during his debut and a plain one after the Summit War of Marineford. Four years ago, when fighting against Ace, he wore a black gi instead with fish designs on either side of the chest, and a red sash with a tanto tied to it. Two years after the war, while waiting for Luffy at the Sea Forest, his kimono has leaf-patterns. During Caribou's cover story, he is seen in another one patterned with flowers. For footwear, he appears to wear simple geta on his webbed feet. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the middle of his chest. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, his kimono is yellow and has a Jolly Roger design arranged like stripes. Additionally, he is also wearing an orange-colored coat. In the Wano Country Arc, his kimono is yellow with large orange and white diamonds patterned on it, a red sash, and his coat has a wave design, colored a dark purple that becomes progressively lighter and finally white at the ends of the sleeves and bottom. Like everyone else participating in the Raid on Onigashima, Kin'emon briefly gave Jinbe a Beasts Pirates disguise. In Egghead Arc, Jinbe wears a hooded Hawaiian shirt, with a pair of shorts, an earpiece, and a pair of DOM Shoes. He wore a Neptune Army uniform while he was serving as a soldier and was often seen smoking a pipe back then. During Otohime's funeral, Jinbe wore a suit. In SBS Volume 63, Oda draws the Seven Warlords of the Sea as children. Jinbe as a child is seen with light hair wearing a tattered gi practicing his Fish-Man Karate. He already had a black belt at this age.", "personality": "Jinbe is a fish-man of great pride and honor. He is known to the World Government as a pirate-hating pirate, possibly due to the actions of the pirates in Fish-Man Island, kidnapping fish-men and merfolk to sell them as slaves. However, he has great respect for Whitebeard and his crew as he sees them as a completely different story. Because of what Whitebeard had done for his homeland, Fish-Man Island, he understands the damage a war between the World Government and Whitebeard would cause. He knows that places like his home, which are protected by simply being part of Whitebeard's territory, would suffer the most should Whitebeard lose the war. Also, despite originally hating pirates, he did not spare a second thought of becoming one in order to aid his brethren Fisher Tiger. Because of his honor, Jinbe is very respectful and considerate to the people he serves under. When asked to join the Straw Hat Pirates, Jinbe declined due to still being affiliated with Big Mom and could only join after he left her crew. Jinbe also desired consent from his crew, the Sun Pirates, in order to join the Straw Hats, showing Jinbe is very considering towards his now former crew members' feelings. However, despite wishing to settle things with Big Mom with honor and respect, after Jinbe saw her Roulette, he correctly deduced that it was rigged to kill him and his crew and chose to silently revolt instead. However, once Jinbe confronted Big Mom again, he personally declared his intentions to leave her crew in front of her guests and crew members to ensure it was official.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former captain of the Sun Pirates, a former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates, Jinbe is a mighty veteran pirate with great authority and a high level of respect from his previous subordinates. He is one of the crew's top four fighters along with Luffy, Zoro and Sanji. Alongside Sanji, Jinbei is one of two members of the crew to fight without weapons or Devil Fruit powers in combat. Even before he began his pirating career, Jinbe's childhood in the lawless Fish-Man District imbued him with combat skills that would allow him to become an elite soldier of the Neptune Army. He battled Portgas D. Ace on equal terms to the point of near-death, despite Ace possessing Logia powers, in a five-day long fight, and he shared a cell with him on Level 6 of Impel Down, where only the most fearsome criminals are locked up. Jinbei's power and influence are so great that him departing from the Big Mom Pirates would severely diminish their organization's overall strength, and him becoming a member of the Straw Hats was seen as a major event worldwide. Even CP0 agents commented on his strength and believed he was capable of killing Who's-Who, a former CP9 agent (who was said to be a rival to the genius prodigy Rob Lucci) and member of the Tobiroppo, the strongest six Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates. He was the first fish-man to become a Warlord, with his considerable former bounty of 250,000,000 reflecting the danger the World Government believes he poses. After his imprisonment and resignation from the Seven Warlords, participation in Impel Down's first ever mass breakout and the Summit War of Marineford, it was raised to 438,000,000, and after the Raid on Onigashima, it was raised to 1,100,000,000, currently the third highest among the Straw Hat Pirates. Jinbe boasts considerable interpersonal skills, which he exercises to maintain Fish-Man Island's connections to human organizations. He served as a Warlord of the Sea to improve relations with the World Government and served under Big Mom after leaving the Warlords, being entrusted by Neptune to run errands for her. He was able to quickly convince Monkey D. Luffy, Capone Bege, and Caesar Clown to put aside their hostility with each other and form an alliance due to their mutual hatred towards Big Mom. Jinbe also has a very acute sense of danger, as he refused to spin Big Mom's roulette after sensing murderous malice from the roulette; Pedro and Brle later confirmed that the roulette had been rigged to ensure death to anyone who spun it. Jinbe possesses immense willpower, being able to completely suppress any emotions of fear, which renders him immune to Big Mom's lifespan-stealing powers. This was shown again when he stayed conscious from Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Issho", "episode": "Episode 701", "chapter": "Chapter 630", "year": 2013, "note": "His alias was revealed by Sakazuki in Chapter 700. His real name was revealed in Chapter 705.", "appearance": "Fujitora is a blind man with only the whites of his eyes showing, though he usually keeps both eyes closed. He has an X-shaped scar centered on the left side of his forehead that stretches over both eyes, which was actually self-inflicted due to his decision to blind himself. He has short dark hair, a mustache, and a beard. He seems to be very tall, a trait shared with other admirals. Like other admirals, Fujitora sports the standard Marine coat with his personal clothes underneath, wearing the coat on his shoulders like a cape with his arms not in the sleeves. His sleeves' cuffs are purple. While previous admirals and other high-ranked Marines wear the conventional suit and tie underneath their Marine coats, Fujitora opts for a light-purple yukata held up with a dark purple belt, all underneath a purple cloak, matching the color in his alias. Fujitora wields a shikomizue (a Japanese swordstick) that doubles as a cane for his blindness, and also wears geta sandals. He has white bandages wrapped around both of his forearms, with handguards on both hands.", "personality": "Fujitora is a virtuous man who cares greatly about doing the right thing and detests evil. His blindness is a result of him intentionally inflicting damage on his eyes out of sorrow for all the evil he had seen, with him stating in Dressrosa that not having sight is a blessing. His Justice motto as a Marine is \"Humane Justice\" (, Jingi aru Seigi?). His primary goal is to protect people, telling a subordinate that it is more important to take into account the number of lives to protect rather than the number of enemies against them. He takes care to never put innocent civilians in harm's way during conflict and will try to avoid causing collateral damage with his attacks; when he does inflict such damage, he makes sure to compensate the owner of the involved property. Fujitora will make the effort to keep civilians away from harm even when he himself is not involved in the proceedings, including doing things such as protecting them from the collateral damage of other fights and even proactively calling for extra medics to come to the Corrida Colosseum in the likely event that spectators were harmed by the combatants' attacks. As a result of his desire to protect civilians, Fujitora is proactive about hunting down and capturing pirates and other criminals. He will not step outside his bounds to do so, as shown when he came to the Corrida Colosseum which was a safe zone for criminals, but he did plot with his subordinates to arrest the criminals competing there as soon as they exited the arena's confines. Fujitora is shown generous enough when he permitted Revolutionary Army and the Celestial Dragons' slaves to escape when Fujitora was never truly loyal towards the World Nobles. Fujitora's desire to eliminate evil also extends to rooting out corruption within the Marines and World Government. Crocodile's attempted takeover of Arabasta in particular drove him to question the government's choices and judgment, especially regarding the use of the Seven Warlords of the Sea as a check against pirates and criminals, when it often resulted in brutal and tyrannical pirates terrorizing people and shipping arms illegally under the blanket of government immunity. He strongly believed that ending the system would result in better outcomes for eliminating piracy and evil, despite its perceived threat to the balance of the Three Great Powers. He is willing to accept blame for the shortcomings of the Marines and World Government, to the point of prostrating himself before King Riku Doldo III along with his troops to apologize for the harm Doflamingo had wreaked upon Dressrosa and having it broadcast to neighboring islands. This resulted in a very tense and explosive conversation with his superior, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki over Den Den Mushi. As their conversation progressed, Sakazuki grew incensed that Fujitora's actions had caused the Marine's reputation, and justice by extension, to be shamed, since the admiral had publicly admitted that the government had failed in its duty. Fujitora then lost his composure and shouted angrily at Sakazuki, disgusted at the idea that justice was dependent on looking right rather than being right, one of the few times he has not been seen acting in a calm and dispassionate manner. As noted by himself, however, Fujitora is pragmatic and has had to align himself to some degree with parties he opposes for the sake of protecting innocent people. This dynamic drove many of his actions during his time in Dressrosa; at first, despite his opposition to the Seven Warlords system and suspicion over Doflamingo's activities, Fujitora agreed to aid the Warlord in opposing the Straw Hat Pirates for the sake of protecting Dressrosa's populace. However, he later changed his mind after Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his \"Birdcage\", as he believed that the Straw Hats stood the best chance of saving Dressrosa as well as showing the failure of the Seven Warlords system. In both instances, he made clear that he would pursue the downfall of both the Donquixote and Straw Hat Pirates after the necessity of working with them came to an end. Additionally, Fujitora will uphold the letter of the law for the World Government even if he does not care for it, such as letting Caesar Clown go free due to being the subordinate of a Warlord. While he will obey his superiors' command in most instances, Fujitora has been known to exploit loopholes as he sees fit, such as when he went to Mary Geoise while being banned from going to Marine bases and invoking the loophole when notified of Sakazuki's disapproval. Just as he does not hesitate to pinpoint and work against evil deeds in the Marines and World Government, Fujitora also has no issue with acknowledging good deeds done by pirates. He has rather bluntly stated that the World Government was to blame for Doflamingo's atrocities whereas Luffy, a pirate, was the hero of Dressrosa. When the Dressrosa citizens got in the way of his pursuit of the Straw Hats, Fujitora recognized the honesty and good intentions of Luffy towards the civilians. In fact, it was Luffy's attitude and actions that first caused Fujitora to regret blinding himself, as he wondered what Luffy might look like; he even thanked the pirate for saving Dressrosa. A few days earlier, when Luffy had exposed the Donquixote Pirates' cheating at roulette against Fujitora, the admiral was greatly appreciative of his kind deed and declined to exchange introductions so that he might remain ignorant of who helped him should their positions result in conflict. Additionally, as shown during the war on Dressrosa, Fujitora may choose to not relentlessly pursue people who are considered enemies of the Marines if they do not pose a threat to innocent people, especially if doing so would threaten innocents around them, or if there are more pressing matters at hand. Despite his desire to prevent collateral damage, Fujitora has been shown to use tremendous displays of force against opponents, particularly at the very beginning of his battles. While confronting Trafalgar Law alongside Doflamingo, Fujitora immediately started the fight by summoning a large meteor to strike their location, saying it was only a \"little test\". When Doflamingo's thugs tried attacking him and Luffy after their swindling was exposed, Fujitora immediately chose to send them to \"hell\" and slam them deep into the ground with his gravity. However, Fujitora's displays of force can at times be completely reckless, as best shown when he summoned another meteor during his fight with Sabo only to have it sliced apart by Doflamingo's \"Birdcage\" and destroy more of the surrounding area than he intended. Additionally, his attempt to summon a meteor against the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny whilst also piloting a battleship through the air led to the meteor being redirected and striking his ship. However, even when he encounters a bad situation, Fujitora has been shown keeping his calm, at worst only getting flustered. In the aforementioned battleship attack, Fujitora was shown sitting calmly and eating noodles even when the crew's counterattack put the rest of his subordinates in a panic, and he remained calm throughout Doflamingo's Birdcage game despite the mass hysteria inflicted, even putting his trust in others to resolve the great problem without hesitation. Fujitora loves to gamble and play casino games, having been shown playing roulette in his first appearance and making big wagers including going all-in in the last round he played. In fact, his obsession with gambling is at such a point that he has been shown to treat life the same way as a game of chance, having made allusions to betting and rolling dice when speaking of the conflict in Dressrosa and showing a great reverence for the forces of fate. Most notably, he treated his trust in the Straw Hat Pirates to take down Doflamingo as simply another one of his bets, though with the stakes now being life or death rather than monetary. Later, when faced with the choice of whether or not to follow his orders to go after the Straw Hats and Law, a choice with merits on each side, Fujitora decided to make this decision by rolling a die and assigning an outcome based on where it landed. When the die's outcome had him leave Luffy alone for two consecutive days despite the low odds, Fujitora stated that something was certainly on the pirate's side. Fujitora generally acts humble in conversation, as shown when he downplayed Doflamingo's words of praise for his abilities when the two of them first met. Additionally, despite his great status, his casual mannerisms are no different than a normal older blind man, and many of the people who saw him at Dressrosa did not know who he was. However, during combat he is shown to take pride in his status as a Marine Admiral and his reputation as a \"monster\", hating it when people take pity on him due to his blindness. When Luffy informed him of the attacks he would perform ahead of time during their battle and explained that it was out of respect for the admiral's character, Fujitora briefly lost composure and started laughing, though also expressed disappointment at the pirate's illogical behavior. Fujitora is also prideful when it comes to upholding his morals, as he refused to apologize to Sakazuki for his actions following the Dressrosa conflict even though Sengoku said such an apology would likely be enough to get his punishment lifted. Although aware of the great evil in the world, Fujitora has shown himself to be quite trusting and thus will typically accept anyone's answer to events he is unsure of due to his blindness. This was best shown when he was willing to believe Doflamingo's thugs when they told him where the roulette ball landed, allowing them to nearly swindle him out of all his money. However, if tipped off that he is being tricked, he will not respond kindly to those who trick him. Fujitora's willingness to give people the benefit of the doubt even extends to his interactions with pirates, as he gave Law the opportunity to inform him that the Straw Hats were his subordinates, despite those around him clearly knowing that that was not the case. Additionally, although he brought up the suspicions, he had regarding Doflamingo committing illegal activities in secret, Fujitora had no intention of pressing the Warlord over it before investigating further.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Fujitora has command over the thousands of Marines ranked beneath him, his status being just below the fleet admiral's. Among other things, he holds the authority to call out battleships however he sees fit and to initiate a Buster Call on any island he deems a threat, as well as pass on to lower-ranking government agents the same privilege. Combat-wise, Fujitora (along with his fellow admirals) is thought to constitute the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\", making him one of the world's most powerful people. As noted by Doflamingo and himself, Fujitora and Ryokugyu are known as \"powerful monsters\" in the Marines. Fleet admiral Sakazuki had confidence in Fujitora's ability to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law, both members of the Worst Generation and the latter (at the time) a Warlord of the Sea. From just a brief display of his powers, Fujitora earned the prompt admiration of Luffy, who could easily ascertain his strength. Yet another such display sufficed to intimidate Law and even the normally unshakable Doflamingo. Greatly attesting to his power, Fujitora was able to fight Sabothe Revolutionary Army's chief of staff and \"No. 2\" in strength, who had not long beforehand acquired a powerful Logia abilityto more or less a standstill, emerging from such fight without a scratch. By Sabo's own reckoning, Fujitora had not gone all out but merely stalled for time, due to not seeing his then-foe as a true enemy. Additionally, with the presumed assistance of other powerful Marines (particularly Sengoku and Tsuru), Fujitora was able to soundly defeat Jack, a top commander of one of the Four Emperors with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, in a naval battle. Despite being blind, due to his other acute senses and Kenbunshoku Haki, Fujitora can handle himself perfectly well in combat, even against very powerful enemies, with Law noting that his blindness seems to not hinder him much at all. He has excellent hearing, having heard Nami's lightning from kilometers away when neither Doflamingo nor Law next to him did. He also stated that he is able to sense the movement of clouds."},

After the timeskip, he had a small scar over his right eye, his hair appeared longer, and he had a second shorter strand of hair hanging over the left side of his face. He also wore a light pink kimono very similar to the previous one with the simplified version of the pirate flag of the Whitebeard Pirates on the legs, along with a purple obi with pink spots, a black cape and black gloves.

During the raid on Onigashima, the CP0 agents that encountered Izou preferred to avoid fighting him in favor of their current mission, despite Izou being heavily injured and it being two on one. While Izou was ultimately defeated and killed, he was able to take one of them down with him.

He wore a round, checkered hat on his head and a bow tie on his chest, and had short flippers and tiny penguin feet, as well as bandages circling part of his lower body.", "personality": "Due to being animated by Sanji's shadow, Inuppe initially shared his refusal to ever harm a woman, going so far as to attack Gallant Hippo for trying to harm Nami before daring the other zombies to come at him if they had a problem with him doing so. This extended to his fellow zombies as well; even if he stopped one from attacking a woman, Inuppe would not harm a female zombie, no matter what she looked like. Though he did not know why he was protecting a woman he was supposed to be hunting, Inuppe would go as far as to challenge Absalom in order to prevent him from pursuing her. However, as with all zombies who complete a past erasure contract with Gecko Moria, Inuppe eventually lost Sanji's memories of his fellow Straw Hat Pirates, as well as his emotions, and became completely obedient toward his masters, to the point of attacking Nico Robin, something Sanji himself would never do, and jumping out of a tower if ordered to do so.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to Gecko Moria and his crew not connecting Sanji to his badly-drawn wanted poster and thus not knowing the power that his bounty implied, Sanji's shadow was not given a body strong enough to bring out his full power. Despite this, Inuppe is considered to be as strong as a General Zombie by his fellow Wild Zombies due to having defeated Gallant Hippo with a single kick, breaking his sword in the process. Working in tandem with Jigoro, Inuppe managed to subdue Tony Tony Chopper and Nico Robin, both highly skilled Devil Fruit users, and shortly afterward clashed evenly with Jigoro himself despite the latter being a General Zombie. As a zombie, Inuppe could not feel pain. In addition, he possessed considerable endurance, having quickly recovered from being smashed into a wall by Lola despite his relatively weak body, and was durable enough to match Jigoro's sword attacks with kicks and not be injured. Like Sanji, Inuppe fought exclusively with kicks; though he did not use any techniques exclusive to the Black Leg Style, a single kick from him was powerful enough to defeat the Vice-Commander of the Wild Zombies snap a large axe in two, and evenly match a sword strike from Jigoro."},
{"name": "Inuarashi", "episode": "Episode 808", "chapter": "Chapter 756", "year": 2015, "note": "He first appeared shadowed in Wanda's flashback in Chapter 806.", "appearance": "Inuarashi is an incredibly large and grizzled canine mink. He wears a small pair of blue sunglasses and has shoulder-length black ears, a white beard, and a large and bushy tail. Like all the retainers of the Kozuki Family, Inuarashi bears the family crest somewhere on his body. During the battle against Jack, he wore a dark-colored striped suit with a frilled collar, a belt, a light-colored cape, and a helmet. After waking from his coma, he wore a king-like robe, and his head and torso were covered in bandages. While being tortured by Jack, Inuarashi lost his left leg. Later, during the Raid on Onigashima, it is revealed that he has replaced it with a sword.", "personality": "Inuarashi is a kind, noble, and humble mink who is deeply loved and respected by his people due to his great benevolence. He was eager to meet the Straw Hat Pirates after they saved the Mink Tribe, indicating a grateful personality, and he downplayed his strength when he was complimented by Luffy. Inuarashi has a very refined and sophisticated personality as he is very polite and soft-spoken in speech. He refers to himself with \"watashi\" and always speaks to people including enemies in a very courteous manner. Due to his gentleman sophistication, Inuarashi strongly dislikes barbarism, as he was greatly shocked by Jack's completely unreasonable and violent nature. He also holds strong contempt for Nekomamushi, who he insultingly called a Monster Cat due to the latter's aggressive and wild personality. Despite being the strongest warrior on Zou, Inuarashi prefers diplomacy over aggression when dealing with hostile parties. He cares immensely for his people and their rich cultural history, to the extent that he was willing to lay down his sword to reason with Jack and the Beasts Pirates and would have allowed them to search for Raizo if they ceased their attack. During the brutal interrogation by the Beast Pirates for Raizo's whereabouts, Inuarashi pleaded with Jack and his men to spare his citizens from their brutality despite being subjected to horrendous torture himself. However, he is also firmly loyal and possesses an incredibly strong will, having absolutely refused to reveal Raizo's presence on Zou despite the brutal torture at the hands of Jack even when he lost his leg, and was fully willing to risk the kingdom's destruction in order to protect his friend. Like the rest of the canine minks, Inuarashi finds Brook to be delicious because of his body of bones, but was willing to let him recover and chew on him later after seeing his injuries.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the former two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Inuarashi held a large amount of influence over the Mink Tribe, and acted as the main authority figure during daytime. Inuarashi had full authority over the members of the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad, including the combat force delegated to Shishilian, Concelot, and Giovanni, who all took their orders directly from him, before he stepped down from his position. Inuarashi is just as strong as his nightime counterpart and friend Nekomamushi, causing all of their battles to end in stalemates. According to Wanda, he is his country's strongest warrior. Inuarashi fought evenly against Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, before the latter poisoned him with Caesar Clown's Koro gas. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, Inuarashi (in his Sulong form) was able to seriously injure the Emperor Kaidou in his dragon form."},

After becoming part of Leo's pirate crew, Inhel has a drawn scar that goes over his left eye.", "personality": "Inhel seems to be fairly serious when speaking with regards to Operation SOP and other business matters. He, like the rest of the dwarves, is extremely gullible.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a dwarf, Inhel can move very quickly and can lift objects several times his own weight. He is seen carrying a double-ended spear, but it is unknown how skilled his is in using it.

He has indigo hair, with two particularly large tufts at the side of the head, and his face is white, with purple lines near his eyes, presumably some sort of make-up. He is pot bellied, with thin limbs, and a muscular torso, making his body resemble a Volumetric flask. On his forehead he has a pair of purple round-shaped eyeglasses. He wears a large yellow polka dotted indigo scarf and indigo-striped shoes (similar to Kuro's) that make a farting noise every time he takes a step. He also wears indigo overalls that exposes his chest, with two lines of buttons on the front, and a lab coat over them. On his hands there is a pair of brown gloves. It seems that in his twenty years, he did not change much in appearance, aside from his scarf being orange with a lined pattern, and he did not wear glasses on top of his forehead.", "personality": "Indigo is a doctor with an eccentric personality: he has a distinct laugh which goes \"Piro piro piro\", adorns shoes that emit sounds of flatulence whenever walking, not caring if others gets irritated by this, and also often tries to act like a mime, but usually breaks character by suddenly talking, though ironically becomes completely surprised if someone actually understood his charade type speech. He also appears to be careful, as he always carries around a vial of antidote to the Draft disease, just for precaution.", "abilities_and_powers": "Indigo is a chemist. He was the one in charge in the development of Shiki's scheme involving all the monstrous animals, and was the one who developed the SIQ serum. He is a strong fighter who was able to fight along side Shiki and his crew when they fought against the Roger Pirates. He is possibly a proficient swordsman, as he was seen attacking Luffy with a sword fitting his size, and wielding it during the battle in Shiki's palace. Indigo is also a skilled dancer, taking part in all of his captain's little \"dance shows\"."},

In terms of attire, Imu dons a crown that has four sharp, incredibly tall spikes on the top and an extremely long robe that flows upon the ground a great distance behind them.", "personality": "Little is known about Imu's personality, but they have developed a particular interest in Monkey D. Luffy, Marshall D. Teach, Shirahoshi, and Nefertari Vivi. During the events of the Levely, Imu kept wanted posters or photos of all four on their person. Despite this, Imu seems to have a calm demeanor, as shown when they gently handled the butterflies in the Room of Flowers; though in that same moment, Imu was also shown to have left the aforementioned pictures (save for Vivi's) pierced through and cut apart by weapons. Imu has demonstrated greater cruelty and apathy than the Five Elders. While the Elders tend to feel hesitant about ordering mass executions to protect their secrecy, Imu annihilates entire islands in order to erase them from history with pure enthusiasm. This immense callousness is best evidenced by Imu ordering the destruction of Lulusia Kingdom purely to field test the Mother Flame, completely disregarding the lives of its inhabitants, solely due to the close proximity of the target island. Despite their existence being meant to be secret from the world at large, Imu is not above revealing themselves to individuals of interest, as with Nefertari Cobra when he questioned the lost records of his ancestor and Ohara's scholars. However, Imu and the Five Elders had no intention of letting Cobra leave the room alive after Imu showed themselves. Likewise, when Sabo appeared and attacked, Imu was furious that their existence was revealed to an outsider. When confronting Cobra, Imu was initially polite in their speech and offered to explain what the Will of D. actually meant, but quickly became much more hostile when talking about the subject of the Poneglyphs. Likewise, Imu has an intense hatred of those who bear the Will of D., as the moment Imu discovered Cobra's ancestor was a D., Imu immediately attempted to kill him. Imu uses the unique first-person pronoun \"Mu\" (, M?) seemingly derived from their name, as well as the unique second-person pronoun nushia (?) for others.", "abilities_and_powers": "The full scope of Imu's abilities and power is unknown, but the fact that they sit upon the Empty Throne, a seat whose occupant would be associated with sole authority over the entire world, plus the fact that the Five Elderswho are publicly considered the World Government's highest authoritiesbow down before Imu and address them with a great honorific, indicates that Imu indeed holds the highest authority within the World Government. However, their power seems limited in so far as they cannot publicly exert their authority, thus electing to direct the Five Elders to act out their will instead, by proxy. Imu can order the deployment of an immensely powerful weapon called \"Mother Flame\", which was built by Dr. Vegapunk and can affect the total annihilation of an entire island within seconds."},

His face is often seen curved into a sinister expression. He wears a light-colored shirt, dark-colored pants, small ring-shaped earrings, long boots ending in a cuff, and a Shimenawa-like rope around his waist like a belt. His hands have sharp, dark-colored fingernails. He appears to have the daiji  (\"one\") tattooed on the right side of his chest.", "personality": "Like the other Numbers, Inbi likes to consume alcohol, as evidenced by the multiple sake jars beside him.

Usually Inazuma is seen with a glass of wine being held in his left hand, and sporting a particular pose, even while fighting, and even continues to hold the wine glass while using his Devil Fruit ability. As a man, Inazuma has his glasses on regularly. His jaw and body are also quite rectangular in shape. As a woman, Inazuma wears her glasses on top of her forehead, her jaw and body are also more rounded in shape, and the scar seems to move more towards the right side of her head. Inazuma also has a noticeable habit of keeping his free hand out and flat besides him despite gender. It should also be noted that Inazuma is one of the few (if not the only) okama to be depicted in a relatively normal manner without any of the excessively flamboyant characteristics or Drag Queen dressing and make up (or actually, no make-up at all), prevalent amongst okamas in One Piece.", "personality": "As a man, Inazuma is mostly serious, calm and level-headed, almost emotionless. He only shows emotions during critical moments, such as relief when he thought that Ivankov survived his battle against Magellan, and panic moments later when he realized that Ivankov had been defeated by Magellan. As a woman, Inazuma is warm and cheerful, in sharp contrast with her male persona. Also, regardless of gender, Inazuma seems to lack the general flamboyant disposition of an okama unlike most of the other okamas depicted in One Piece. As either personality, he is very loyal to Ivankov and will usually do nothing until given an order.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a deputy commander of the Revolutionary Army, Inazuma boasts significant authority within the organization. Within the G Army, his authority is second only to his direct superior, Ivankov. Inazuma is an accomplished fighter who is capable of fighting while still maintaining his somewhat jaunty pose and holding his glass of wine. Though he appears to primarily fight with his Devil Fruit powers, he is also a proficient physical fighter, proven when he sent a wolf from the ferocious Wolf Unit flying with a kick. Even the Level 6 prisoners compliment his skills."},

Each pair of arms seems to have a corresponding pair of pectorals, as eight of them are visible on his chest. He has a long beard complete with a mustache, white skin, and a bulbous nose. On both his topmost forearms and on his belly he bears swirl-like tattoos, and on his right shoulder is tattooed the New Fish-Man Pirates' Jolly Roger. Underneath his helmet is his hair that is in the shape of a spear that he will use as a last resort. He wears a round helmet with goggles, with a dark stripe on top of it, and a large loop earring on each ear. He's bare-chested, but has a pair of suspenders-like belts reaching down from both of his shoulders to his waist. These are attached to a pair of rings, supporting some sort of light apron around his waist; he also dons dark pants reaching down below his knees and sandals. Each of his arms has a bolted wristband and holding a long spear with a tassel right below the head. As a teenager, he did not have a beard, his lips appeared larger and his eyes rounder, he wore a different, more elaborate round helmet, with a crest on its top and no goggles, paired with a simple vest. He also carried around a single pole-arm, instead of eight. Due to the negative effects of the Energy Steroids, his body became old and weak with his hair turning grey which now reaches the back of his neckand his beard becoming even longer as well. He also became very skinny.", "personality": "He has a habit of saying \"Much\" at the end of sentences. Like Hody Jones and the other officers, he follows Arlong's ideals and despises humans as well as Queen Otohime's ideals. He was shown to be brutal as he used threats to force the Fish-Man Island citizens to step on the fumi-e of Otohime. Like Hody, Ikaros does not have any care for his comrades as he did not think twice about using his spears on one of them for accidentally using fire in his vicinity. However, that seems to apply only to the lower-rank subordinates since Ikaros showed concern for Hody as he was suffering from an overdose of Energy Steroids. Because of a traumatizing event, when his giant squid friend Daidalos died from dehydration by being too close to the sun, Ikaros has developed severe pyrophobia, and would instinctively curl up backwards when exposed to flames, in reference to dried squids. In related matter, Ikaros would also curl over like this when something else shocking appears in front of him, such as Nami deactivating her invisibility, and he seemingly despises the mentioning of dried squids, as he was annoyed when Luffy called the kraken \"Surume\" (dried squid).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Ikaros has command over lower-ranking crew members.

However, although he has no interest in the goals of the New Fish-Man Pirates, he is shown to be very efficient when he does have a client as shown when he forced the Fish-Man Island citizens to comply with the New Fish-Man Pirates. Since he was hired help, he himself did not share as much of the same views as others working for Hody, but was no better due to his role in life. Despite priding himself as the best swordsman of Fish-Man Island, he does not seem to have the honor of one, as he tried to kill Zoro with a sneak attack from behind, which has often been referred as a shame for a swordsman. He can be angered when he is insulted, as shown during his fight with Zoro when his opponent called him a \"frog\". He is well acquainted with Hatchan, and seems to look down on him for the Fish-Man's skills in swordsmanship and says Arlong would have taken him if it was not for his money problems. He apparently has developed a sense of intrigue with Luffy, as he stated he thought it would be a shame if Luffy died from his poison. He can be sarcastic since he claimed that he felt bad for Arlong for recruiting Hatchan. After his transformation from Energy Steroids overdose, his personality changes: even when drunk, bystanders note that he has seemingly developed a lust to cut anything - even his own allies - as opposed to simply attacking blindingly. Despite his lack of interest in the New Fish-Man Pirates' goals of extreme misanthropy, he was willing to use large amounts of Energy Steroids to accomplish his goals, knowing that it would shorten his lifespan; he showed the dangerous move of mixing alcohol (depressant) with drugs (stimulant) together.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to his defeat and rapid aging, Hyouzou was a mercenary, the strongest swordsman on Fish-Man Island, and the assassin of the New Fish-Man Pirates. He claimed he was not assisting them for common goals, but simply because he was hired for it: the fact that the crew resorted to hire a merman mercenary tells a lot about Hyouzou's abilities. Even though he is a freelancer assassin for the crew, he still appeared to be an officer of his crew. Just like the other officers, he led a squad of their crew during their takeover of the island, and when the other officers were arrested and imprisoned, Hyouzou was alongside them instead of the lower-ranking members, who were merely sentenced to work off their debt to society. He also has a very strong will, as he was completely unaffected by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki blast."},

Countless samurai and even Oden himself held utmost respect for him. Hyogoro deeply despises the tyranny of Kurozumi Orochi and the Beasts Pirates, denouncing their oppression of Wano's citizens and murder of everyone who stood up to them. When given the chance to submit to Orochi, he refused, yearning for the old days when honorable people were still alive. As such, due to his absolute dedication to samurai's honor, pride, loyalty, and chivalry, he was completely disgusted and infuriated to see Orochi's subordinates switch allegiance to Kaidou right after Orochi was decapitated by Kaidou. After spending a long time in the prison, he became broken down physically and mentally, although he still voiced his disappointment with his lack of food despite such an attitude being punishable. However, when Luffy gave him more dango, Hyogoro took the pirate's honor very seriously and made no secret of his new fortune, being willing to accept death for it because of how it fulfilled his memories of the past. By his admission, he consigned himself to a miserable death in prison. Upon reuniting with Raizo and made aware of the whereabouts of the alleged deceased members of the Nine Red Scabbards and Momonosuke, Hyogoro came to appreciate a new will to live, being very relieved that he did not die before knowing everything, and requesting to join the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance to overthrow Orochi and Kaidou. He can be bold to the point of staying in the path of an angry Big Mom just to test Luffy. During the raid on Onigashima, he is shown to be optimistic, saying that he cannot imagine the alliance losing.", "abilities_and_powers": "In the past, Hyogoro was once Wano's most famous yakuza boss, being in charge of all Underworld dealings in the Flower Capital. He carried enough respect to hold authority over the five yakuza bosses of the other regions of Wano. In fact, his popularity among the Wano population was so massive that Shinobu was certain that, even after two decades, Hyogoro alone would be able to recruit the necessary amount of samurai to stand a chance in the revolution against Orochi. At his best, Hyogoro was quite a powerful warrior, respected by countless samurais, Yakuzas, and even Orochi and Kaido; wanted to recruit him into his ranks. In fact, before the confrontation between Oden and the pirate, the latter stated that if the samurai had allied with Hyogoro five years earlier, he and his crew would have been at a clear disadvantage against the nation's samurai."},

{"name": "Hody Jones", "episode": "Episode 608", "chapter": "Chapter 527", "year": 2010, "note": "He was officially introduced in Chapter 611.", "appearance": "Hody is a grey-skinned great white shark fish-man. He had a large belly, with a tattoo of the New Fish-Man Pirates design on the right side as well as a long scar on the left, and muscular arms and legs. His facial features include glaring eyes, with long and distinctive eyelashes, a mouth full of sharp, triangular teeth, and a stub nose. He had long black curly hair, with a long tuft hanging on the left part of his face. His left arm is intricately tattooed, with the Arlong Pirates' Jolly Roger near the wrist and several circular designs above it ending with two skulls on the upper arm; he also has some spikes protruding from his bare wrist and circling it all, possibly decorative piercings. His brief fight with Zoro left him with a new scar that appears to start below his left shoulder and goes down his chest diagonally to the right, similar to the one Dracule Mihawk gave Zoro. He sported a pink newsboy cap, with a little trident represented on the left side, bearing a resemblance to the same weapon he was sometimes seen carrying around, and a massive scarf seemingly made from a dog-like animal around his neck, with the animals head hanging on the left side of his chest. Hody was seen wearing a red open shirt with short sleeves, a wide collar and dark-red spots on the lower part, short blue trousers with a similar pattern but with light-blue spots, a pink sash tied around the waist, and sandals. After overdosing himself on Energy Steroids, Hody underwent a drastic change in appearance: he no longer had a large belly, being far more muscular than before, with his muscles bulging in size with thick veins appearing, particularly on his arms, and his size greatly increased, being in equal in size to Ikaros Much, the largest of the New Fish-Man Pirates, while sitting down. His dark hair had lightened exponentially. He no longer wore any headgear, and donned a shirt with the colors reversed from the one he originally wore, with the dark background having turned light and the light spots along the bottom having turned dark. He also carried his trident on his back. As Noah continued to descend on Fish-Man Island and Hody's hatred grew stronger, the sclera turned red and he was seen with an enlarged jaw about the size of Luffy (though in the anime it was because he consumed more Energy Steroids). He also appears to have grown so much muscle mass that his shirt ripped apart as a result. It is later shown after he is defeated that during his last fight with Luffy that he gained enough muscle mass that he is now the size of the royal princes. By the time of his defeat and capture, the crew noted that Hody looked like a monster. After being defeated and imprisoned, another side effect of the Energy Steroid kicked in- the shortening of the user's lifespan relative to the number of steroids consumed. Unfortunately for Hody, his (and his fellow officers') Energy Steroid abuse has resulted in all of them becoming old and frail- and Hody's appearance has changed into that of an old man's, considerably more aged than his subordinates due to taking an especially large quantity of the steroids. His hair remained white, and nearly all the hair on his upper scalp fell out, causing him to become bald, except for the curled hair that hangs below his neck, which remained intact. He grew a mustache, as well as a goatee several inches long, and his skin wrinkled. He also became incredibly skinny, losing all of his muscle and some of his teeth with the remaining teeth now square instead of sharp, and has become hunched over on bent knees now having to walk with a cane. As a teenager, he had less sharp facial features, shorter hair, and a leaner build. He wore a newsboy cap with the word \"CHECK\" imprinted on it and a simple scarf paired with an open dark vest decorated by two sword-like motifs on the front.", "personality": "Hody is a racist, overly hypocritical, prideful, brutal, and vicious natured fish-man who, like many of his kind, hates humans for leaving Fisher Tiger to die when he could have been saved (which was not true, as Tiger refused human blood due to being betrayed). He proves this by attacking humans within his reach. He, like Arlong, believes that fish-men are the supreme race, demonstrating his arrogance by attacking Gyro's crew with his hands cuffed, showing them that they could easily be destroyed even with the handicap. He then deliberately released the crew, injured but alive, setting them as examples, telling them to spread the word of the New Fish-Man Pirates. Despite the fact that they both looked down on humans, his treatment of humans is even more brutal than Arlong's. He considers his human captives to be expendable and sees them as nothing more than pawns whereas Arlong had left humans alone so long as they paid him \"tribute\" money periodically. Arlong mainly killed humans to make examples of them when they did not pay up and was content with leaving them be, aside from odd acts to make sure the humans knew who was boss, but Hody will go out of his way to attack humans, such as using them as part of his plan that will almost ensure their deaths, and threatening to kill them outright if they refuse, giving them very little chance to live altogether. Hody basically grew up basking in the hatred of fish-men towards humanity. He and his crew would hate and fear the day when the animosity between humans and fish-men would fade. This leads Hody and his crew to become bloodthirsty radicals who do not care for the peace of Fish-Man Island. Hody himself believes that heaven has selected him and his crew to hand judgement down to humanity, in spite of the fact that humans did utterly nothing against Hody personally. From his point of view, hatred towards humans is his definition of pride. Hody despises anyone who wants peace with humans especially Otohime, claiming that her preaching was aggravating and he did everything in his power to keep her hopes and dreams from becoming real. Hody's belief of fish-men superiority is so fierce, he fanatically believes that heaven itself has granted him power. Despite Hody seeing Arlong as a role model, there are several factors that greatly distinguish the two, besides the difference in their levels of cruelty. While Arlong was tight with his wallet and could not pay for Hyouzou for his services as well as failing to get Vander Decken IX as his subordinate, Hody managed to make accommodations for these two by being more open with financial compensation and was willing to treat powerful allies as equals instead of being a dominating leader. While Arlong valued and considered his crew as his brothers and was extremely angry when one of his crewmen was used as a shield by Luffy, Hody, on the other hand, does not hold camaraderie in any regard even though he has been close to his officers since they were kids. In fact, Hody had no problem using one of his own subordinates as a shield to protect himself and also taunted Neptune for using himself as a shield to protect his own soldiers from harm, deeming him unworthy to be king because of that. Furthermore, according to Hatchan, while Arlong would not harm his fellow fish-men, Hody will kill any fish-man who has shown sympathy towards humans, even referring to the people who gave their signatures to support the migration as a list of traitors. Also unlike the Arlong Pirates, who demonstrate their pride as Fish-Men by utilizing on their natural strength, Hody and his crew did not care what methods they use to show off their superiority, which was best shown by their heavy abuse of Energy Steroids (as Hody calls Arlong's methods to be barbaric, which the New Fish-Man Pirates believed to a mistake to be learned from). He has gotten so arrogant that he now does not seem to care about anyone but himself and his goal, to the point he is willing to sacrifice 100,000 of his own subordinates without a second thought. Hody is also completely fearless (if not insane and delusional), using Energy Steroids, a potent drug that increases his strength, knowing the effect also shortens his life (though he apparently did not realize it greatly accelerates one's age instead of simply reducing the lifespan). He appears to have developed an addiction to the drug as he continuously ate it throughout the day and even swallowed a giant handful of steroids at once, whether as to gain an upper hand against his enemies or as painkillers. He also threatened his crewmates for preventing him from overdosing, and his violent nature may have been intensified from the side-effects of the Energy Steroids. This arrogant stubbornness led him to overdose heavily and, in turn, destroyed his body, which even then, did not deter him from hating humanity irrationally. His arrogance also made him extremely shortsighted, as he did not even consider the consequences of allowing the Candy Factory to be destroyed, thereby angering Big Mom, whose own power and crew vastly outmatched anything Hody or his crew were capable of combating. Hody considers King Neptune to be a coward and shows a desire of taking Fish-Man Island from him. He will do whatever is needed to achieve his goals as he joined Neptune's army solely for sheer military knowledge and experience and has no qualms about betraying his former comrades. Hody's cruelty, recklessness, hatred, superiority complex and biased goals led Neptune to refer him as quite selfish. He claims that he is fully willing to give his own life to destroy humanity. Hody has shown a great deal of cunning as he deceived the citizens of Fish-Man Island into believing a human murdered Queen Otohime, stole the Energy Steroids from the royal palace without Neptune suspecting him, and later allied with Vander Decken IX (even though Hody does not really see him as an equal) so as to carry out his plan on infiltrating the near impenetrable Ryugu Palace and in an effort to kill Shirahoshi. Hody is also extremely arrogant and boastful (to the point of being insane), showing that he not only thinks himself above all humans, but also above all his fellow fish-men, and went as far as to call the Straw Hat Pirates and a former Warlord of the Sea weak, despite their fearsome reputations and high bounties. Like many other characters, he has a distinctive laugh: \"Jahahahaha!\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Hody had complete authority over the crew. However, he was stripped of this power when he and his crew were arrested by the Neptune Army. Usopp noted that Arlong was nothing compared to Hody. Camie mentioned to Nami that Hody's mind is more dangerous than his strength, with his deep hatred being his drive beyond his physical limits. However, he was shown to be vastly inferior to several of the Straw Hat Pirates, being severely injured by Zoro even while underwater and easily overpowered by Luffy; to compensate, he was forced to gorge on the Energy Steroids to become a match for Luffy. In this overdosed state, Luffy believed Hody's sheer toughness would be enough to earn him a bounty of at least 100,000,000, and he critically injured Luffy (piercing through his Busoshoku Haki) by biting his shoulder. He also has a strong will, as he was largely unaffected by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki, although his hand trembled slightly."},

He also had a black goatee and mustache.", "personality": "Hiriluk was a very eccentric man, who would test his experimental medication on unsuspecting patients only for it to backfire, causing the quack doctor to flee. However he was very caring towards others, as he honestly tried his best to cure them of their afflictions, and never desired any rewards.

Even when Chopper retaliated with violence, Hiriluk did not back down and ended up taking on a fatherly role to the abandoned reindeer.

Eustass Kid even went as far as to claim that he \"could be the key to the war for One Piece\", suggesting that without knowing who he is or his whereabouts, no one would be able to find the One Piece, making him invaluable to anyone aiming at claiming it. According to Laffitte, Hinokizu is said to create ocean vortexes while sailing which swallow up any ships that come too close to him; Laffitte speculated that this may come from a Devil Fruit power."},

It is difficult to tame, but Tama managed to tame it with her powers.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hihimaru possesses a great amount of strength, and is well-known for it by the residents of Kuri, being called the \"raging baboon of the mountain\". It had developed a great reputation while serving the Beasts Pirates, and its keepers were concerned at it being tarnished when the komainu Komachiyo put up a fight against it. Its loss was seen as significant by the Beasts Pirates, and caused them to take an interest in Tama and her taming powers. Tama is confident enough that he can delay both Page One and Ulti at the same time for three minutes. In the anime, Hihimaru was struck by Page One's ancient zoan form and continued to fight, implying great endurance."},
{"name": "Hina", "episode": "Episode 171", "chapter": "Chapter 127", "year": 2001, "note": "", "appearance": "Hina is a tall, slim woman with dark brown eyes and straight, waist-length pink hair worn in a middle part. She wears dark red lipstick and is sometimes seen smoking a cigarette. During her first appearance, she wore a burgundy-purple two-piece suit over a white blouse, as well as dark brown shoes and a pair of dark gloves. Her second outfit consists of a purple shirt with a deep neckline and golden motifs on the front, matching long pants, and high-heeled shoes. She also sports a bead necklace around her neck and a pair of purple sunglasses either covering her eyes or on her forehead. As with most Marines, Hina often accompanies her outfit with a long white Marine jacket draped over her shoulders like a cape. The only difference is that she retains her signature color on the epaulettes, which was light blue, while Marines officers normally have red and blue epaulettes. As a child, she had the same haircut but with shorter hair. She wore a plain striped dress and shoes. She was depicted as keeping several pet birds in cages, in reference to her Devil Fruit.", "personality": "Hina is immensely sober and dignified, rarely showing any significant emotion even in defeat. Though not sadistic or fanatical like many other high-ranking Marines, she is ruthlessly pragmatic in her work, and willing to exploit any possible advantage over criminals. At the same time, she is fairly tolerant of unprofessionalism from other Marines, even her direct subordinates. Contrasting her coolheaded demeanor, Hina routinely speaks in the third person (e.g., \"Hina failed\"), a trait stereotypical of young children and women trying to affect an \"innocent\" air. Her reasons for this, if any, remain unknown. Hina also seems to be quite knowledgeable on historical facts, such as the legendary Rocks Pirates, whose existence is only more commonly known among older Marines (e.g. Garp and Sengoku) rather than most Marines of her generation.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hina has proven to be quite perceptive, as she was able to see through Miss Goldenweek's, Mr. 5's, and Miss Valentine's disguises by looking at their wanted posters. She is a skilled unarmed combatant and was able, with the aid of her Devil Fruit, to defeat Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, an extremely powerful hand-to-hand fighter, in a one-on-one battle on two separate occasions."},

He has a reverse crescent moon tattoo on his ankle.", "personality": "Hidayu is loyal to the Kozuki Family and often maintains a stern, stoic expression. He was hesitant to believe the Kozuki Family had returned to usurp Orochi, but was faithful after being imprisoned. He broke his normal expression when he joined the Onigashima raid after Denjiro freed him, smiling and cheering, and again after Big Mom attacked his comrades, gritting his teeth and showing concern.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a samurai, Hidayu is likely proficient at combat.

He wore a long red coat over a white shirt, black trousers, and a golden necklace.", "personality": "Higuma was an arrogant, brutish man, always ready to boast about himself and brutalize the weak, including children. Having lived inland for all his life, he developed a particularly low opinion of pirates upon meeting the Red Hair Pirates, deeming them all \"cowards\" when their captain refused to be baited into a fight. Like most brutes, he had little courage of his own, and reacted poorly to genuine danger. When the Red Hair Pirates seriously foughtand effortlessly crushedhis henchmen, and again when the Lord of the Coast attacked him, he could only panic and scramble for his own life.", "abilities_and_powers": "Higuma was the leader of his own bandit gang, and powerful enough to have earned a bounty of 8,000,000 (notably higher than the average East Blue bounty of 3,000,000). By his own account, he had killed fifty-six people. Nevertheless, a mere fraction of the Red Hair Pirates' power was enough to intimidate him into running. He also possessed some cunning, keeping a smoke-bomb ready for emergency escapes and reasoning that nobody would anticipate a mountain bandit like himself hiding out at sea. However, he was notably ignorant about the sea itselfin particular the vicious Sea King that dwelled near Foosha Village, which ultimately cost him his life."},
{"name": "Heracles", "episode": "Episode 524", "chapter": "Chapter 420", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Heracles is dressed in a beetle-stylized armor that looks like a hero costume with a mask that covers his face, a mantle, and a purple cape. He has a round-shaped body with relatively thin arms and legs.", "personality": "He has an odd habit of adding \"n\" to people's names (a Japanese quirk often done to show friendship), as well as at the end of sentences (in Japanese). For example, he called Usopp (, Usoppu?) \"Usoppun\" (, Usoppun?), and he himself is Heraclesun (, Herakuresun?). He also has a habit of repeatedly introducing himself. Heracles has a usual laid-back attitude, but is quick to react when he senses dangers. He also seems to be an easy target for flattery and compliments.", "abilities_and_powers": "Heracles' main style of combat involves the usage of a spear and explosives. His attacks are apparently very fast. Though round in appearance, he is fit and strong which is evident from the way he defeated a giant beetle and man-eating plant with a single kick. He also has a great amount of knowledge about the different plants and animals of the island where he lives and his armor gives him additional defense. He keeps a stock of Pop Greens in his belt. He also seems to be able to control giant beetles. Despite his incredible power and combat prowess, he has a tendency to be uncoordinated (having falling headfirst off a vine he was swinging off) and rather nonchalant about his rather painful methods; a spear he threw to kill a giant beetle almost skewered Usopp in the head, and to save Usopp from a carnivorous sunflower, he punched Usopp to create a projectile that defeated the plant."},

She also wears headphones over her ears, a belt with heart-shaped buckles around her torso, and a backpack with a hanging teddy bear.", "personality": "Hibari is an emotional young woman who is willing to put herself in danger for the sake of an ally. She is kind and considerate towards others, but somewhat bashful and embarrassed over how a boy like Koby may interpret her gestures. She speaks the Hiroshima dialect, for example using the particles k (?) and n (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine commander, Hibari has power over lower-ranking subordinates. She is also part of the elite Marine squadron SWORD, implying her skills are among the best the Marines can offer."},

His mouth stretches to the sides of his face like a Glasgow smile. He has black sunken eyes and visible bone ridges on his forehead. There are stitched scars at his chin, mouth-line, and the high point of his cheeks. Tattoos resembling thorned vines run along his shoulders, arms, and neck. He wears a dark blue corset laced with red string, red pants with an armored pad over his right leg, and long brown boots.", "personality": "Heat holds high respect for his captain, Eustass Kid. This is seen when he exclaimed \"Master Kid!\" out of shock, when his captain was shot in the leg by a Pacifista. Heat was also willing to plead to Shanks for his captain and crew to be spared after the latter was defeated by him . Despite this Heat finds acts of crying or pleading to be pathetic as he insulted Sanji for crying for help during the Raid on Onigashima.", "abilities_and_powers": "Heat has the ability to breathe fire; how he does it has yet to be explained.

{"name": "Helmeppo", "episode": "Episode 3", "chapter": "Chapter 2", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Helmeppo is a lanky, average-sized young man with a distinctive cleft chin and light blonde hair. Originally, he wore his hair in a bizarre mushroom-shaped style, coupled with flashy leisure suits (and what appeared to be a rubber-band ring on his left hand). After his father was ousted from power, he was \"demoted\" to a standard Marine chore-boy uniform. Under the training of Vice-Admiral Garp, he became notably taller and more muscular. By the time he progressed to Chief Petty Officer, he started to wear his hair in a broad ponytail, coupled with a white shirt, pale green vest over it, purple slacks, black gloves, and a rather odd-looking black visor over his eyes. At his current rank of Lieutenant Commander, he has donned a brimmed white hat and junior Marine officer's overcoat. Unlike most other Marines of similar rank, he wears this coat conventionally (i.e. with arms in the sleeves).", "personality": "During his father's rule over the 153rd Branch and Shells Town, Helmeppo was a spoiled and obnoxious man, constantly exploiting anyone he could with threats of arrest and execution. Whenever his status failed to protect him, he would inevitably collapse into total cowardice. Even at his worst, however, he was notably sentimental, showing small mercies unknown to Morgan. He lost his luxurious life that he had under his father's rank after his father was kicked out. He was forced to become a chore boy alongside Koby, whose friendly approaches were turned down. Part of Helmeppo was still loyal to his father which was evident when he cried before his father's execution. However, he later realizes that his father is as brutal and murderous as the pirates, causing Helmeppo to oppose and disown him. This finally cut his last tie to his father and pushed him to change, becoming braver and less of a spoiled brat. Eventually, he and Koby become good friends. Helmeppo matures by the events of Water 7, even referring to his younger self as \"that bratty, selfish son who lived off his father's status\". Now a lieutenant commander alongside Koby, he continues his training in the Marines. He was deeply (and comically) upset when Zoro and Luffy did not recognize him. Helmeppo seems to be more levelheaded than Koby when it comes down to analyzing situations, as Koby is more aggressive. After the time skip, he has developed a penchant for being overly formal, even with Koby.", "abilities_and_powers": "In the beginning, Helmeppo was a typical weakling who relied on his father's status to get whatever he wanted. But after a harsh training regimen under Garp, Helmeppo gained great physical prowess. He was able to jump very high while intercepting Zoro. After the two year timeskip, he became powerful enough to become a lieutenant commander, and overpower an entire pirate crew by himself with great ease."},
{"name": "Hattori", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Hattori is a white pigeon and is always seen wearing a light red tie while Lucci was undercover as a shipwright and a black one afterwards. He wore a light green coat identical to his master's while Lucci wore his during the Sea Train ride to Enies Lobby and the meeting at the Tower of Justice. After the timeskip, Hattori wears a white coat and hat resembling those worn by Lucci, though with the addition of a white necktie.", "personality": "Why Hattori is with Lucci is unknown considering the man's reputation as a heartless mass-murderer, though Lucci has had him since he was a child. He apparently is not afraid of Lucci and is very loyal to him, as he stays close to his master even in dangerous situations like the Buster Call. He even attempted to bandage him after his fight with Luffy and was happy when Lucci finally woke up in the hospital in St. Poplar. When Lucci is not fighting, Hattori is usually perched on his master's right shoulder. Lucci would have had to express some emotions to blend in with citizens while undercover, but Hattori did this for him as his ventriloquist dummy; this allowed Lucci to be somewhat sociable while at the same time remain emotionless. While Hattori reverts to being an ordinary pigeon after Lucci was revealed to be an assassin, he occasionally exhibits human traits such as drinking from a cup.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hattori does not seem to have any combat abilities, and in battle, tends to fly out of the way, generally hovering around in a circle like a bird of prey until the fight is over. He does, however, seem to be incredibly intelligent, able to understand human mannerisms and can mimic them as part of Rob Lucci's ventriloquism act in Water 7, such as moving his beak in sync with Lucci's words and moving his wings around like human arms, as well as facial expressions. He was also seen wearing a coat, holding a glass and drinking like a human."},
{"name": "Hatchan", "episode": "Episode 69", "chapter": "Chapter 31", "year": 1999, "note": "Also known by his nickname \"Hachi\".", "appearance": "Hatchan, being an octopus fish-man, has eight appendages (six arms and two legs) and an octopus-like face. He has pink skin and grey hair styled into five spikes. By the time he had become a takoyaki salesman, he had a second row of spikes. He has a muscular build and suction cups on his six arms, which he can use to cling on to walls. Hatchan has a tattoo in the shape of a sun on his forehead, as a result of being in the Sun Pirates. While most fish-men have webbed hands, octopus fish-men do not, as neither Hatchan nor Octopako have webbed hands. When first arriving at Cocoyasi Village, Hatchan wore a diamond-checkered outfit. In the Arlong Arc, he wore a striped outfit. Hatchan usually wears heavy clothing and shirts made especially for octopus fish-men. During the Sabaody Arc, he wore a jacket to cover his four extra arms and a bandage to cover his tattoo to prevent him from being captured and sold at the Human Auctioning House. When the Straw Hats arrive at Fish-Man Island, Hatchan wears a shirt from the Criminal brand.", "personality": "Hatchan is not very intelligent and can be easily duped, such as when he failed to recognize who Roronoa Zoro really was, and mistakenly begins to introduce himself while asking other people their names. He initially fails to understand Zoro's words during his battle about the difference in \"weight\" between their swords (he assumed Zoro meant weight as in \"heavy\", but Zoro was referring to weight as in \"burden\"). In his fight against Zoro, he made many misjudgments and even at some points allowed himself to get angry, which partly contributed to his defeat. By the time he meets the Straw Hats again near Sabaody Archipelago, his personality seems to have changed. He seems to be significantly more intelligent and very knowledgeable about the Sabaody Archipelago, though it is likely because he is quite familiar with it (he thought Duval and Sanji looked the same, and was still easily tricked by Sanji into revealing his true identity), and wisely cautions Luffy against provoking the World Nobles in spite of their cruelty. He has also become very ashamed for what he and the Arlong Pirates did to Nami and her village, and is genuinely sorry for what he did. Since then he has tried to atone for all of his past sins. Hatchan is also rather humble in comparison to other fish-men, often accepting that things are how they are and not wanting to upset others. He seemed to respect Arlong as a friend, going as far to support his ambitions by willingly joining his crew, a band of fish-men who hate humans, despite Hatchan himself not particularly despising or discriminating against humans. Hatchan is extremely kind and caring, as he frequently protected Camie and Pappag from being abducted by the Macro Pirates. During his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, he also restrained Arlong when he violently assaulted Koala out of annoyance. Hatchan also readily helped a town of catfish who were suffering from a famine by selling all his newly acquired treasure to buy cooking equipment and ingredients to feed them. Due to his kindness, Hatchan recognizes humans by their character instead of their race, as during his childhood, he saved Rayleigh from drowning in a shipwreck, becoming close friends with him and his wife Shakuyaku ever since. While he supported Arlong as his crewmate, Hatchan personally never engaged in any sort of cruel abuse towards the people of Cocoyasi Village like the rest of the Arlong Pirates, and even Nami vouched that Hatchan was the better one of the Arlong Pirates and that they should save him. Hatchan's childhood dream was to be accepted into the human society, and he admitted that Arlong's tyranny was going too far. Unlike Kuroobi and Chew, Hatchan alone was not corrupted by Arlong's ideals. After Luffy accepted Hatchan as a friend, he outright opposes Arlong's ideals, much to Hody Jones' disappointment.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hatchan can shoot streams of ink from his mouth like a true octopus in order to blind enemies, allowing him to strike them down while they cannot see. He also covered himself with the ink in a failed attempt to conceal his identity from the Straw Hat Pirates."},

On the left side of his abdomen is a tattoo of the daiji \"\", which means eight. He wears a yellow track-jacket that remains unzipped, leaving his bare chest exposed, dark pants and light shoes with laces. He also possesses a pair of oval sunglasses.", "personality": "Like the other Numbers, Hatcha likes to drink. He seems to like fighting and quickly took the opportunity to attack Luffy, Zoro, Kid, and Killer when they broke into Kaidou's fortress, with his careless use of force resulting in collateral damage and members of his own crew going down. This recklessness caused his crewmates to try and stop him from attacking further, and Kid noted that they seemed to have trouble controlling him. Hatcha is attracted to the General Franky, seeming to view it as a toy and preferring to chase after it rather than fight his crew's enemies. Like the other Numbers, Hatcha has a unique laughter style that plays off his name and the number eight: \"Hachachacha\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his large size, Hatcha is extremely powerful, wielding his club to strike heavy blows. After somewhat sobering up, Hatcha was able to lift his fellow Number Jaki over his head with ease.

Under the employment of Ukkari Hot-Spring Island, he now wears a howdah-esque carriage (large enough to hold dozens of average-sized humans) shaped after a bus driver's cap; its \"hatband\" is decorated with a scissors emblem, and equipped with a massive flashlight. His face also bears the resort's logoUKKARI bisected by an old-fashioned rendering of the kanji for bathwater (?).", "personality": "Unlike many of Arabasta's native animals, Hasami is completely docile, and quite willing to trust and help smaller creatures, including humans. Similar to his friend Matsuge, he has a lecherous interest in human women, and is easily \"energized\" by the sight of them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hasami's size is coupled with considerable speed, making him a highly effective draft animal able to carry numerous people over long distances.

His voice also becomes much deeper when he swells up to reveal his needles.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a fish-man, he was born with the natural strength ten times that of an average human, and twice that underwater. The spikes on his body make it difficult for him to be harmed by unarmored melee attacks. He can inflate his body like a pufferfish, extending his spikes outwards in an attempt to stab the enemy.

Haredas uses a technique in the form of a bubble-like barrier that allows him to be unfazed by the extreme weather while walking in Weatheria.

{"name": "Hannyabal", "episode": "Episode 525", "chapter": "Chapter 422", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Hannyabal is a large pot-bellied man that resembles a cross between a devil and an Egyptian pharaoh. His brow ridge is shaped like horns, his chin is shaped like a pharaoh's false beard, and he wears a nemes with yellow and green stripes, the striped head cloth worn by pharaohs, with his hair coming from inside the nemes. His face in particular is designed in such a way that it looks like a Hannya mask. He wears demon-like wings on his back and also carries a pitchfork around, another common symbol linked to the devil. 22 years ago, when Shiki escaped the prison, Hannyabal was seen wearing the standard militaristic white uniform that normal guards wear. He still wore the nemes and the bat-like wings, but he also wore a cap over the former. Now, he goes bare-chested in reference to his great endurance. After his original nemes had been stolen by Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, his new one has a fox figurehead attachment on top that resembles the Egyptian jackal God of Death Anubis and has blue stripes instead of the green stripes. Overall, his appearance is an allegory to the underworld. After the timeskip, he now wears an outfit similar to Magellan, but without the horns that Magellan wears. He also appears to have gained a significant amount of weight. As child Hannyabal was rather chubby. He wore nothing but a leaf-skirt and a pair of black sandals. He is depicted as a fire-dancer.", "personality": "He has a habit of saying he owns everything and then having to apologize afterwards for getting ahead of himself. He does this because he is an ambitious person. He also seems to be prone to \"Freudian Slips\", which often give insight to his previously mentioned, ambitious qualities and his somewhat dark brand of humor. Hannyabal usually tries to show off how tough he really is to the prisoners by going into the Freezing Hell of Level 5 without weapons and almost completely naked, a reason he is admired amongst the guards. He is emotionally more stern than most characters and can maintain a clear mind even in the presence of Boa Hancock, remaining unaffected by her charms. Despite this, he seems to be easily infatuated with beautiful women, as he let slip of his true ambitions towards Hancock. This might have been because \"she wasn't his kind of woman\" as later he was easily seduced by Nami (who was really Bentham in disguise) and by Olive in the anime. Hannyabal's desire to become Warden by eliminating Magellan causes him to willingly jeopardize the security of Impel Down, such as letting prisoners run away, if it means for a chance to pin the blame on his superior. In short, Hannyabal cares more about his own position than the security and welfare of the prison, however he seems only willing to let prisoners escape if they are relatively harmless (ex. Buggy and Mr. 3) and shows genuine concern when powerful prisoners escape, like Crocodile and Jinbe. Despite his seemingly lack of seriousness most of the time, due to his desire to get Magellan fired, Hannyabal may get serious when the situation gets to the extreme, especially if he risks getting fired too. When this sudden change occurs, it can surprise even people who know him. Even though his ambition gets the better of him most of the time, those selfish aspects of his disappear completely when he feels the safety of civilians are on the line, such as dangerous prisoners escaping. It turns out that he is a considerate person who became a jailer to protect the lives of innocents by keeping criminals in prison. Furthermore, he was the only high-ranking jailer who was never shown torturing the inmates or to enjoy doing so. This other side of his personality is the reason he became a jailer in the first place, and the level of willpower he displays in this mindset is reminiscent to Luffy himself. Even when completely overwhelmed and near the brink of death, he will force himself to stay conscious and keep dangerous prisoners from escaping even when he barely has any strength left. Almost paralleling Luffy in many of his fights, he will grab onto his opponent limbs while on the ground and nearly beaten, to just barely hold them back before getting up and continuing to fight. His ideology towards pirates capable of great destruction like Luffy, Jinbe, or Crocodile is very different from most marines who believe in Absolute Justice. To him, he doesn't damn pirates and revolutionaries as evil or enemies of the World Government. He damns them because most committed grand crimes, and regardless of what those crimes were, they have enough power to create great alarm to the normal citizens of this world. He loathes the glorification of piracy, as those reputations were all created by breaking the law and becoming criminals, including Ace and Luffy. And thus, if powerful criminals are able to escape, the citizens of the world would fall into panic knowing dangerous criminals remained unchecked in the world and can even escape from Impel Down. He is willing to lay down his life even in a losing battle for this belief.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the current warden of Impel Down, Hannyabal has full control over Impel Down. Unlike Magellan or the Four Jailer Beasts, Hannyabal seems to lack a feared reputation for the prisoners to acknowledge, as Buggy and Mr. 3 stated that they had not heard anything about him. However, this was misleading, as he is one of the most powerful enforcers in Impel Down, being more powerful than any of the four Jailer Beasts and second only to Magellan himself. A possible explanation is that he will not fight unless it is an extreme emergency, such as a prisoner from Level 5 or Level 6 trying to escape. If not, he will not move a finger and leave the job to the Jailer Beasts or Magellan. He easily defeated both Buggy and Mr. 3 without a single scratch on him, even after taking a direct hit from Buggy's Muggy Ball (which was enough to severely harm the Jailer Beast Minotaurus and annihilate the entire platoon of jailers guarding the door to Level 3 ). On the other hand, the guards seem to know him to be a powerful fighter and enforcer. Magellan himself claimed that Hannyabal is the only person worthy to be his successor as Chief Warden of Impel Down, and this is later proven when after the two year time-skip Hannyabal was shown to have indeed succeeded Magellan as Chief Warden."},

Hammond wears shin-high, frayed white pants with a mint-green sash and black sandals. On his head he has a black fedora and earrings on both ears.", "personality": "Hammond is a Fish-Man who, like Arlong, views humans as an inferior race. He is a very proud Fish-Man and extends this to other sea creatures, such as Surume, whom Hammond criticized for allowing Luffy to order him around. When meeting the Straw Hat Pirates, he gave them the ultimatum to either enlist under the banner of the New Fish-Man Pirates or die. Even in his arrogance, though, he is surprisingly thoughtful, as he carefully thought out the Straw Hats' list of offenses and appeasements to the Fish-Men, and was considerate enough to view pirates as enemies of humanity (despite most of them being humans themselves) that he gives them the choice of siding with them or being destroyed.

Luffy is currently wearing. Ironically, Roger's looks in his youth were strikingly similar to Luffy's and as he grew older he began to resemble his future son, Ace.", "personality": "Roger was said to be fearless, and those who witnessed his execution even claim that he smiled just before his death, and during all of his flashback appearances, Roger was seen with a confident smile. His personality is often noted by people who knew him to have been similar to that of Monkey D. Luffy. This is best shown when he meets Rayleigh and asks him to join him, despite having no idea how strong he was or even what role he would have on his ship. Portgas D. Ace revealed his lineage to Whitebeard, who noted that Ace's personality was not much like his father's. However, they both shared a refusal to run from battle. Monkey D. Garp stated that Roger would not run away from an enemy in order to protect his crew from danger. They both also shared the common traits associated with the Will of D. Roger was also a man who loved big, flashy things and reveled in his title of Pirate King despite his oncoming death. While not portrayed during any of his appearances, he could be a merciless enemy when he got angry. This was further evidenced when he killed all of Squard's crew members personally for unknown reasons. Roger was very quick to anger, and he would retaliate for something as simple as an insult to his crew, regardless of how small it might be. Garp stated that an angry Roger could be a violent, selfish, and short-tempered man, but his actions had been pure and straight, just like a child's, and that he was lucky to survive and become the Pirate King despite his extremely reckless nature. He also had a side to him that mocked his enemies. After defeating a group of Marines, he told them to bring Garp or Sengoku while telling the Marines he just defeated that they were not worth his time. He did get excited when he got the opportunity to face strong enemies, charging straight ahead past Rayleigh and Scopper Gaban to face Kozuki Oden himself. When he clashed with Whitebeard for the first time in a while, he reacted with glee and casually greeted his old rival. Despite his prideful and aggressive nature, Roger was a considerably humble man as he bowed to Whitebeard and Oden when requesting the samurai to join his crew and offered all the treasure and supplies his crew obtained to Whitebeard in exchange for Oden's service. He was also more than happy to tell others of his dreams and would socialize with his rivals with great enthusiasm. In addition, he was considerate towards civilians, and forbade his crew from stealing from them. He also had a soft spot for children, as he was seen happily cradling Kozuki Hiyori when she was a baby. He was even gentle towards children of other races such as with the mermaid Shyarly when he innocently asked her for some predictions with a gentle smile, and with the mink Pedro when Roger encouraged him to wait for his own moment one day. He also believed a newborn child should not be responsible for the sins of their parents, as he asked Garp to protect his unborn child because he did not want his child to be killed for being related to him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Roger was hailed as one of the strongest pirates of all time, if not the strongest, considered nearly unstoppable in battle. As the Pirate King, he retains the highest status among all the world's pirates, even post-mortem. Elucidating this is the truly enormous bounty he had prior to his death, with 5,564,800,000 being the highest in pirating history. In addition, unlike the majority of the most powerful individuals in the world, Roger never had any Devil Fruit powers, which makes him even more impressive. Very few people are known to have ever matched Roger in battle: most prominently the legendary \"Hero of the Marines\" Monkey D. Garp, said to have cornered Roger multiple times before his surrender. According to Roger himself, he also considered Sengoku, the then future Fleet Admiral who wielded the power of a golden Buddha Mythical Zoan, as one of the two Marines that were worth his time. Aside from his animosity with the Marines, Roger's second foremost pirate rival was Whitebeard, who wielded the strongest Paramecia-type Devil Fruit and was renowned as the \"Strongest Man in the World\", even before Roger's death. Another person known to rival Roger was Rocks D. Xebec, who was considered to be his first and most formidable rival, even more so than his former subordinate Whitebeard would come to be, as it took the combined efforts of both Roger and Garp to finally defeat Rocks. Other examples of Roger's strength include fighting on equal ground with Shiki, who commanded the largest pirate fleet of his time, and single-handedly defeating the armies of several countries. and he also fought against Chinjao in the past many times. Kaidou, who at some point came to be called the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Roger in the same elite class with a very small number of other notable figures that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, Shanks, and his former captain Xebec. Even a mighty warrior such as Oden, who had effortlessly slain actual gigantic beasts, commented on Roger's prowess, comparing his presence to that of a wild beast's."},

{"name": "Gloriosa", "episode": "Episode 514", "chapter": "Chapter 408", "year": 2008, "note": "She was first introduced as Elder Nyon. Her real name was revealed by Boa Hancock in Chapter 517.", "appearance": "In her first colored appearance, in the opening \"Share the World\", her color scheme is completely different. Namely that the alternate casual top of the Kuja, which appears to be evening wear, that she wears is blue instead of the pink-bordered burgundy seen in the anime. Additionally, her Snake Weapon is colored purple, as opposed to the white color seen in the \"Share the World\" opening. It acts as her staff and the upper body of the snake is curled up. She is remarkably diminutive in height, with very thick lips, and is wrinkled from old age. She also wears some kind of sea-green bubble belt apparently meant to hold up the spotted-print short skirt that all Kuja wear. Also like most Kuja, she wears a cape. Her hair is white and she wears a pink flower on the left side of her head.", "personality": "Gloriosa seems to be designed around the concept of a wise old woman, as made apparent by her concerns for Amazon Lily itself and expressing knowledge that her fellow Kuja had no idea of. She also asks the Kuja pirates for books, and has a crystal ball, both things that would further this image. However, since she believed some of Hancock's lies about considering the World Governments' terms for war, this proved that she was still gullible towards people's intent. Although she is not immune to many of Hancock's emotional manipulations designed to make people follow her, Gloriosa can snap out of them much faster than many others, male or female. Although she is no longer the Empress of Amazon Lily, she believes that she can still go anywhere (which Hancock proved otherwise), but chooses to live on the outskirts of the island because she's apparently considered to be a traitor. Though, during their conversation about the upcoming war, when Hancock accuses her of worrying about her own life, she simply states that she's already too old to be concerned about her own life, but expresses concern for the sake of others on the island. Gloriosa does not seem to the share the misandrist tendencies of her fellow Kuja, possible due to her past experiences with men. However, she still strictly abides by the Kuja laws of men not being allowed into Amazon Lily, with her only allowing few exceptions. She also says \"Nyo\" a lot, going as far as to incorporate it into a number of words whenever she talks.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gloriosa has more knowledge than most of her fellow Kuja, such as what a man is as she did identify Luffy as a man upon seeing him. She is also able to throw off Hancock's charms faster than most men and women, showing a particularly strong willpower. Also, being a former Empress of the Kuja Tribe, Gloriosa was undoubtedly a powerful Kuja in her prime and, despite her advanced age, she was still able to not only survive being thrown out of a building, but also land on her feet unharmed. In the anime, in spite of being elderly, Gloriosa has shown to be extremely agile. When Luffy started running off, Gloriosa easily caught up with Luffy, kicking him with great force as Luffy stated. As the former Empress of the Kuja, she can use Haki."},
{"name": "Gladius", "episode": "Episode 682", "chapter": "Chapter 608", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 723.", "appearance": "Gladius wears a long black coat with gold metal rings on the arms and chest, gold rivets studded around the collar and shoulders, and black and gold metal gears on the elbows, along with matching black boots. He also sports a similarly-studded white mask that covers the lower half of his face, matching (black in the manga, white in anime pants with gold yellow zippers on either side of him) a pair of blue goggles, and a black top hat, altogether giving him a style very reminiscent of steampunk. His spiky, light blue hair is usually stuffed inside his hat and flares out when uncovered, often at the hat's expense. As Gladius begins to lose his temper, his hair will puff up to the point of piercing through a hat, or he detonates his headgear. When he ruptured his top hat, he switched to a more durable motorcycle helmet, only to blow it up so he could weaponize its shrapnel. He has a scar across the right temple which seems to reach to his goggles. In the anime, his elbows seem to be completely mechanical. After using his Fashion Punc technique, his hairstyle became a buzz cut. As a child, he wore a black coat with various trinkets on it, and wore a surgical face mask on his mouth and his goggles on his forehead. He also wielded a gladius, fitting his name. At age 17, his hair was shorter and he wore a shorter coat, leaving it open. At age 23, his hair was longer and spikier, and he wore a different coat, now zipped all the way up.", "personality": "Gladius is especially known for his short temper, and his Devil Fruit powers are known to flare up whenever he gets easily enraged. Like most of Doflamingo's underlings, he treats his \"young master\" with utmost loyalty and got angry when he noticed Violet's betrayal. He did not hesitate to shoot Baby 5 while she was assaulting Doflamingo, although he did so very casually, perhaps because he was simply annoyed by the ruckus she was causing. His ruthlessness also extends to his underlings, as he showed no concern to any of them during his fight with Cavendish and Bartolomeo and let many of them get injured by his attacks. He values punctuality and precision in following and executing orders, and he despises those who do not live up to his standards. He seems to have a low tolerance for morbid discussions, as he nearly vomited when Law spoke of hiding within a mountain of corpses during dinner. Despite, or maybe because of, the loyalty he has to his \"young master\", he seemed to be unable to distinguish him from Kin'emon in disguise.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the officers of the Donquixote Pirates, Gladius held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He possesses great durability, as shown when he was struck by one of Luffy's Gear 2 attacks, only to shrug it off and quickly recover with no visible signs of harm and no permanent injuries whatsoever. He also appears to be very agile, easily capturing Kabu, Rampo, and Thunder Soldier, all of whom are known for their high speed. He was able to hold his own in a fight against both Cavendish and Bartolomeo, each of whom has a bounty of over 100 million, although he did end up being defeated."},

She is very passionate about art and her ability to bring her visions to life. However, her passion for the arts seems to somewhat cloud her judgment, as Brook was able to fool her into undoing the transformation on his violin and sword-cane by telling her that he also was an artist and that he wanted to play music in tandem with her art. She is also very cruel when she wishes to be, as shown when she violently yelled and later slapped Mansherry repeatedly to force her powers out all the while smiling at her situation. At age 45, around when Law joined the Donquixote Pirates crew, Giolla was seen acting as a mother-like figure for younger members of the crew, such as baby Dellinger and little Baby 5 and Buffalo. Later she also took young Law under her wing only to be brushed off with irritation while trying to treat his wounds. She was prone to prejudice based on false rumors, as she exclaimed in shock when seeing Law's Amber Lead Syndrome, believing it was contagious before Doflamingo corrected her.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had a high level of authority in the crew, and be in command of more than 2000 soldiers Doflamingo trusts her enough to have her kidnap Momonosuke and raid the Straw Hat Pirates' ship.

His respect for Krieg is so great that he obeys Krieg's orders to throw away his gas mask and breathe the deadly MH5 poison gas because he is ashamed to have failed him.

Some time after the Summit War of Marineford, he began to grow a bit of stubble on his chin.", "personality": "As Bell-mre was growing up, she was known as the village trouble maker (he refers to her as you little thug). Her reputation caused him to express concerns over the children's well-being when she announced she was adopting them as her daughters. He has had close ties with both Nami and Nojiko since they were kids because of his concern over their adoptive mother's capabilities and spent most of his time watching out for them. Eventually this grew into a desire just to see all three of them live together and grow together as a happy family. After their mother's death, he became concerned for the happiness of Nami and Nojiko, as he had grown into a father figure to them. He and the other villagers realized Nami would never join up with Arlong's crew without good reason. His concern for her and Nojiko's well being also led him to promise Luffy that he would hunt him down and kill him if he ever took away Nami's smile. He kept the town together after Arlong took over the island, making sure everyone was safe and able to pay Arlong's tax. Whenever there was trouble between the villagers and Arlong or his crew, he took full responsibility for everything so the villagers would not be punished. He helped keep the village together to give Nami the time to complete her plan to save the village. When her 8 years of hard work to save them fell apart after Arlong's betrayal, he decided enough was enough. If they were going to die, they would die trying to fight Arlong even with Nami pleading that she can just start all over again. Genzo also has a perverted side, as he becomes quite flustered when Bell-mre offered to pay back the items the latter stole \"with her body\" but when Nami parroted Belle-mere's words, Genzo just yelled at the girl not to pick up her adoptive mother's bad habits. Genzo has a blown-up image of Nami's wanted poster, in which she appears in a bikini, despite stating that she shouldn't have posed like that as it would draw the attention of more perverts (Marriage seekers in the English version) than bounty hunters. Genzo was also horrified to see Nami's brazen new dress sense in the papers and imagined faceless leering pirates around her.", "abilities_and_powers": "Nothing more than an ordinary fighter, Genzo lacks any great strength and was easily defeated by Arlong and his crew when he tried to save Bell-mre and her children. However, he has great leadership skills and was the binding force that helped the village survive Arlong and his crew."},
{"name": "Gedatsu", "episode": "Episode 241", "chapter": "Chapter 155", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 254.", "appearance": "Gedatsu is a tall, dark-skinned man. He has an unusual hairstyle, with a row of upward-pointing tufts or rasta-styled dreadlocks from ear to ear. He has a typical Birkanpair of wings on his back. He was seen wearing a matching purple jacket and pants, black gloves and shoes (which have Milky Dials installed in them, allowing the priest to fly), a pink shirt, and a blue tie-like scarf around his neck. He sports a large, white tissue belt around his waist with a red circle in his center, resembling the Japanese flag. Eight years ago, he looked the same, except that his tie was less scarf-like and his shirt had no stripes on it.", "personality": "Gedatsu is one of the oddest characters in the series, as he has many strange habits, none of which he is aware of. He needs to be corrected in every single instance, whereupon he will frown and cry, \"How careless!\" or \"Hey!\" (in the manga, he will have a look of pure shock). His mannerisms are in contrast with his extremely imposing appearance. These bizarre acts of forgetfulness and clumsiness leads to Gedatsu being regarded as incompetent, or outright stupid, which greatly hindered his overall performance as commander of his own Ordeal, resulting in it having the highest chance of survival. These habits include: In spite of these habits, Gedatsu is still a very serious, ruthless and aggressive fighter. He also did not seem to mind if his men are killed, even by him and considers being saved by the enemy as a shame, indicating some strange form of warrior's honor.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gedatsu was the priest in charge of testing intruders with the Ordeal of Swamp, which had a survival rate of 50%. As part of his Ordeal of Swamp, Gedatsu covers the whole battlefield with swamp clouds, so that if the enemy falls in they can not get out and suffocate."},

He has long brown hair that extends halfway down his back over a cape and a black goatee.", "personality": "As the Corrida Colosseum commentator, he has to remain impartial while reporting from the commentator's booth. Even so, he still has an emotional stake in the fighting as he was shocked and disappointed when Hack was defeated during the B block fight, and was cheering for Lucy during the C block. When he learned that Sabo took Luffy's place as \"Lucy\" for the finals, he remarked how it was against the rules. He greatly admires those who are strong, complimenting Luffy for being such a competent fighter despite his small stature. He later showed his selfless side when promising to confront Doflamingo in order to buy Luffy time. While he commented on Luffy and Sabo breaking the tournament rules by switching places, he showed some empathy by stating that he was glad Luffy and Sabo got the prize since it was a part of their deceased brother Ace. He was also willing to put himself in harm's way in order to get Doflamingo away from Rebecca and Viola.

Despite being impaled by Doflamingo, he was able to get up and continue broadcasting, though he was weakened, indicating some physical fortitude. He also has rather sharp eyesight, able to notice where Doflamingo was and what he was doing to Viola and Rebecca. He was also able to spot Luffy being teleported by Law, despite being several kilometers away."},
{"name": "Gecko Moria", "episode": "Episode 449", "chapter": "Chapter 343", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Moria is an abnormally large humanoid creature with very distinct, devil-like features. Standing at 692cm (22'8\") in height, he was the tallest among the Seven Warlords of the Sea. He has two horns protruding from the sides of his forehead and stitches running vertically from the top of his face and down his neck, which is rather long and thick in comparison to his body. His ears and teeth are both pointed, while his lower body is relatively fat and stubby in comparison. Moria's hair is red, and his skin is a pale blue, matching his lips, armbands and the edges of his gloves. His coat and gloves are black, while his pants are bright orange with pale window shapes imprinted on them. He wears a fishnet shirt underneath a cravat, a necklace, and a blue crucifix-like ornament with claw-like appendages sprouting out from three of the cross's points. During the meeting of the Warlords of the Sea at the Marine Headquarters and later on during/after the war, Moria added a fur-laced cape to his attire. After the timeskip, Moria has switched his cravat and crucifix for a tie with a print of the aforementioned crucifix on it. His coat now has a jagged appearance, and he no longer wears a fishnet undershirt, but a regular shirt with chain-like ornaments in it. He still wears a fur-laced cape, although a much shorter one. During Gol D. Roger's execution twenty-two years before Monkey D. Luffy set out on his adventure, Moria looked much thinner, had a pointed chin, and a little longer hair. He also did not have any cross stitches from below his lip, though he did possess them on his forehead. His appearance was similar when he challenged Kaidou in Wano a year later. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Moria had shorter horns and hair and was missing the cross stitches running down the middle of his face. He wore a baggy, long-sleeved white shirt with suspenders and dark, knee-high pants. He also wore his usual long black gloves with cowboy boots with spurs and a jewel-encrusted dagger on his belt. He was also much thinner and had a chin and longer legs.", "personality": "Moria has a relaxed, laid-back, and even lazy personality, seemingly appearing to believe he cannot lose. He also believes that a true pirate should fear nothing, not even death. Similar to fellow Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo, in most situations Moria is constantly grinning maniacally, and only seems to change expression when something bad happens to him or when he believes his power is being ridiculed. Like many others, Moria has a distinct style of laughing: \"Kishishishi\". In general, he prefers to avoid fighting altogether, or at least fighting his enemy directly, either making his shadow fight or ordering one of his subordinates to do so. His proclivity to delegate tasks to his minions is also a weakness in and of itself, along with making exceptions to act out himself should his personal pride or power be questioned; Jinbe noted that Moria had grown weak from his lack of training. Moria desires to become the new Pirate King and believes that this is possible to achieve if he has powerful subordinates. Though he once claimed that he would rely on his own powers to achieve his goals, he is incredibly lazy; his motto is \"relying upon others for one's own objective\" (, tarikihongan?) and his favorite phrase is \"You do it!!\" (, Omae ga yare?). This also extends to his fighting style, as he prefers to lay back and let his shadow battle with the powers of the Kage Kage no Mi. He also appears to have considerable knowledge of the New World and how terrifying it is. At Thriller Bark, he told Luffy that with his current strength, he would lose his crew; his prediction came true before the Straw Hats went to the New World, at the Sabaody Archipelago. Moria has a lot of experience, having fought many opponents in the past, including an Emperor. He is a good battle tactician, being able to outsmart even Nico Robin. However, his overconfidence and laziness made him underestimate his opponents, and ultimately led to his defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates. In the past, Moria had the Gecko Pirates who he considered to be valuable comrades, and by his own admission was overconfident and headstrong. He also deeply cared for his crewmates, which was a point of tragedy when his last encounter with the Emperor known as Kaidou ended with Moria being the sole survivor of his crew. Shell-shocked and traumatized by the horrific event, Moria immediately departed from the New World, and decided that the only way he would not have to face such pain ever again would be to make his comrades unable to suffer by turning them into mindless zombies that serve only his desires. The loss of his crew to Kaidou changed Moria's outlook on life substantially, making him believe that subordinates are better off as zombies because, due to their undead status, they cannot be harmed by any physical damage - they can only be \"purified\" by the sea or elements of the sea and even if they were purified, he could easily find other shadows to reanimate them. In addition, creating a zombie powerful enough to defeat Kaidou became one of Moria's driving motivations. Despite his cruelty and twisted outlook on life, he is capable of showing true care towards those close to him. When Absalom was kidnapped by Blackbeard, Moria did not hesitate to go try to rescue him despite the risks of entering an Emperor's territory, especially given how the Blackbeard Pirates are hunting powerful Devil Fruits. He was also shown to be loving towards Perona when she was growing up, as Perona herself viewed Moria as a father figure, suggesting he is capable of displaying affection to others.", "abilities_and_powers": "Moria is a former Warlord of the Sea, as well as one of the most experienced pirates in the entire Grand Line. In his prime, he was referred to as being a \"rival\" to Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors (though eventually he lost his entire crew to the man). During the Summit War of Marineford, he was strong enough to battle Curiel, the 10th division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, while sustaining no injuries aside from a strike he suffered from Jinbe (a fellow former Warlord). He also managed to fell Little Oars Jr. in one move, though others had already injured the mighty giant beforehand. Unfortunately, his tendency to heavily rely on underlings (or his own shadow) to fight for him in the battlefield may have contributed to his diminished prowess in single combat; often, Moria would run away from or ignore an adversary if he deemed the battle as \"pointless\", as seen when he dismissed Luffy's challenge on Thriller Bark because he had already extracted the Straw Hat's shadow from him. Jinbe claimed that Moria's dependence on absorbing the shadows of other people had weakened him. After the Summit War of Marineford ended, Donquixote Doflamingo claimed that the government had deemed Moria to be far too weak to continue to bear the title of Warlord of the Sea and that he was better off eliminated; despite this, Mihawk recalls that Moria was perfectly fine at the end of the war, it still took Doflamingo and a group of Pacifistas to corner him, and Moria still managed to escape (though that was mostly thanks to Absalom). As further testament to his potential, Blackbeard, who is known for refusing to recruit weaklings into his crew, asked Moria to become his subordinate. Moria has a very strong will, which allowed him to sustain 1000 shadows within his body by using Shadow's Asgard, though it did exert him greatly. He was also completely unaffected by a burst of Luffy's Haoshoku Haki during the Summit War of Marineford."},

Despite this, Mr. 5 was very respectful to his partner Miss Valentine and did not get annoyed with her like some other Baroque Works partnerships would act. Mr. 3, upon hearing about his defeat at Whisky Peak, describes Mr. 5 as \"an over-ambitious fool who did not realize his limits and misused his Devil Fruit powers\". He also appears to have a short temper, as he smacked Karoo for refusing to obey his orders to call out Vivi, viciously kicked Luffy for spitting on his shoe, made Brogy explode for talking too much, and tried to kill Usopp for tricking him into consuming spicy Tabasco sauce.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former member of Baroque Works' officer agents, Gem has plenty of confidence in his abilities and is respected if not outright feared among the lower tier agents of Baroque Works.

{"name": "Gally", "episode": "Episode 902", "chapter": "Chapter 877", "year": 2018, "note": "He first appeared in Romance Dawn, Version 1 in 1996.", "appearance": "Gally is a middle-aged, average-sized man with a strongly angular face; his most distinguishing feature is his handlebar mustache, which extends in two thin crescent-shaped strips beyond his face. His attire is that of a stereotypical pirate captain, with an epaulette longcoat and a bicorne hat bearing his Jolly Roger. During the Loguetown Arc, the anime depicted him with a markedly lanky build and gray hair (save for his black mustache), and added a large upward-curling goatee as well as a downward-curling tricorne. The latter two, when viewed together, gave his face an additional \"crescent\" motif. In Romance Dawn Story, he was depicted with orange-red hair (again save for his black mustache) and a similarly-curling goatee, though his hat was reverted to a conventional bicorne. As of the Whole Cake Island Arc, his design has become mostly identical to that of his original appearance in Romance Dawn, Version 1, with the color scheme drawing from his Loguetown appearance; in the anime, his mustache is also heavily simplified, eliminating the crescent motif.", "personality": "Gally is rude and impatient, as he and his crew continuously demand the chefs of Baratie to bring food to them instead of waiting like any regular customer. In Romance Dawn Story, Gally is extremely cruel and prideful, since he was willing to kill Luffy, Silk, and everyone in the town for his own personal gain. He also swore revenge on Luffy for defeating him and said he will kill him someday. Though Luffy sincerely doubted that.", "abilities_and_powers": "In the anime, Gally is fairly weak, since he and his entire crew were easily defeated by Smoker.In Romance Dawn Story, Gally is a crafty man who acknowledges the powers and weaknesses of Devil Fruit users, as he tactically lured Luffy into the ocean to swiftly defeat him. Otherwise, he is a typical pirate found scattered across East Blue, as his bounty is a mere 5,000,000, compared to Luffy's 300,000,000, and after getting Luffy regained his focus, he easily rent asunder Gally's ship and sent him flying."},

Like other male Baroque Works agents, Mr. 3 has his number hidden somewhere on his costume. For Mr. 3, he has 3's visible on his vest design, upper part of his glasses, and one big 3 achieved through his top knot. He also wears glasses and has neatly combed hair. He was also seen wearing a Log Pose on his left wrist. As a small form of comic relief, his hair seems to form various shapes according to the situation (like an \"!\" when he got scared or a \"?\" when he heard about Luffy for the first time and asked who Luffy was during the Little Garden arc, and even an arrow pointing to where he was talking about during the Impel Down Arc). Later, like most Impel Down prisoners, he wears a striped prisoner's outfit, with his top knot sagging and his right lens of his glasses cracked. His hair became untidy, and he grew a beard due to the roughness of the Beast Hell he was placed in. After the escape, he changed to a black pair of pants, and adorned a cloak over his attire. In an attempt to save Ace, Galdino disguised himself as an executioner, and somehow made himself look slightly more muscular. After the war he trimmed his hair back to its original length but kept his beard. He is also seen wearing a orange button collar shirt and brown pants. When Galdino uses his Candle Champion technique, he gains an incredible change in size.The suit is white; however, with Miss Goldenweek's painting abilities, the suit could be colored, as shown during the Little Garden Arc. After the time-skip, not much has changed about Galdino except that he has grown a full mustache. He also currently wears a white shirt with suspenders and a red bowtie.", "personality": "Galdino thinks very highly of himself, and is not afraid to show it. He believes himself to be a master of strategy, using his intellect and total lack of scruples to complete his plans.This statement is at least partly true, since Crocodile himself admitted that although Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were stronger than Galdino, he had been assigned a higher rank due to his intelligence. He also thinks of himself as a great artist, using his wax powers to turn his victims into \"living statues\" for his former partner, Miss Goldenweek,to paint over. However, when presented with situations in which he has to fight for his life, he reveals himself as little more than a coward who fears fighting (such as when a rage-filled Brogy was close to completely shattering his wax bonds). He is also somewhat sadistic, as he prefers killing people after making them perfect human sculptures in a long and painful process, rather than killing them directly. During his fights, he prefers to prevent opponents from attacking him by trapping their body parts with his Devil Fruit. Galdino also likes tea, especially Earl Grey. However, he apparently had some unexpected changes while in Impel Down. While he was a coward before, Galdino risked his life to repay a debt to Luffy by blocking a torrent of deadly poison. He also admits that if he is not careful, he could end up viewing Luffy as a friend. After Bentham sacrificed himself to save the escapees, he was clearly very upset and admitted that he did not think Bentham was really all that bad. This eventually results in Galdino attempting to free Ace on his own accord, stating that he wants to avenge his fallen comrade and fulfill Bentham's last wish, risking his life for a second time in doing so. Like many other characters, Galdino has a distinctspeech style. He tends to end his sentences in \"gane\", for example: \"omae mo-gane\" (you too gane) or \"warau-gane\" (laugh-gane). Like many catchphrases in the series, it has no actual meaning other than a distinct way of talking.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to the fall of Baroque Works, Mr. 3 was amongst the top-ranked members of the criminal organization, and presumably had a number of Billions (the lower ranked subordinates of Baroque Works Officer Agents) under his command. He is also highly artistic and detailed, capable of perfectly replicating the physical structure of a human being with just a visual in mind. Crocodile only allowed Mr. 3 to hold his position in the organization as \"Mr. 3\" because Mr. 4 was too mentally slow. Otherwise, he would have been ranked lower. In Impel Down, he proves his overall lack of fighting spirit on a number of occasions; this was further proven when he fainted under Luffy's burst of Haki, though he did wake up for some time after that on his own. He acted like a coward and backed up Buggy's escape plan rather than Luffy's much more dangerous advancement to the lower levels. After Magellan had shown up on the fleeing group during their escape, Galdino showed a moment of bravery, but he admitted he could only hold it together for a brief moment. In spite of his cowardice, Galdino seems to have some skill in stealth and infiltration."},

Shortly after landing on the Island of Rare Animals, most of his body was irreversibly compressed into a treasure chest, leaving only his head, hands, and feet free (and one of his teeth dislodged). Over the next twenty years, he grew a sizable beard and an even larger afro, giving him a curiously shrub-like appearance.", "personality": "As a young man, Gaimon was a stereotypically greedy pirate, caring about little more than plunder. This greed was slowly eroded (though never completely erased) by his decades of solitude on the Island of Rare Animals, causing him to prize peace and companionship more than any material wealth.

He is frequently seem smoking a cigar.", "personality": "Like many, Furrari admired the mermaid princess because of her beauty, and was aware that other kings like Jeep would attempt to court her with their children, trying to involve his own son in a marriage pitch as well. He can be easily offended as he got angry when Shirahoshi rejected her suitors. Furrari appears to be fairly argumentative and confrontational, as he and Ramen of Kano Country were shown bickering for an undisclosed reason.", "abilities_and_powers": "Furrari is the king of a nation affiliated with the World Government and one of the few allowed to attend the Levely, which grants him some authority over matters concerning the world.

{"name": "Funkfreed", "episode": "Episode 365", "chapter": "Chapter 254", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Untransformed, Funkfreed appears as a large and intimidating cutlass-esque sword, typically slung over-the-shoulder by Spandam. Only a few vestiges of his animal formmost notably a pair of tusks set into the hilt, and a tail-shaped pommelare visible. Fully transformed, he appears as a gentle, friendly-looking elephant, about one or two heads taller than Spandam. Much of his upper body is covered by anelaborate leather harness vaguely resembling a jhul cloth (with headgear somewhat similar to Spandam's mask). His hide is an ordinary stone-gray (white in the anime). In his hybrid form, his head and upper torso (notably smaller than those of his full-beast form) extend from the hilt in a serpent-like manner, with the blade melding into his trunk.", "personality": "Funkfreed is a peaceable, devoted animal, effectively Spandam's closest (if not only) friend. As such, he tends to be physically affectionate in peacetime, and obedient during battle; however, he is not a particularly brave combatant, and will easily surrender if placed in direct danger.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a sword empowered by the Zou Zou no Mi, Funkfreed carries all the standard abilities of Zoan-type Devil Fruit, and can transform between an elephant-sword hybrid and a full elephant at Spandam's command. This grants him the size and strength of an elephant, the sharpness and durability of a steel blade, and a sentient mind able to strategize between the two; his hybrid form is particularly flexible, and well-trained enough to ram opponents in tight spaces without any fatal damage. However, given that Spandam has virtually no ability as a swordsman, most of Funkfreed's asset lies in catching others by surprise. His capacities for open battle amount to little, his temperament even less."},

This led him to serve Orochi without issue after the latter seized the shogunate from the Kozuki Family, and he questioned Raizo and the Nine Red Scabbards' devotion to Kozuki Oden even after Oden's death, saying they are following a \"ghost\". He was even willing to pledge himself and the rest of the Oniwabanshu to Kaidou, a pirate, after Kaidou had seemingly killed Orochi, though he would later return to Orochi's service after the two of them reunited and began fighting Kaidou's Beasts Pirates on Orochi's behalf; it is unclear what exactly transpired and what Fukurokuju knew between Orochi's seeming death and their reunion. Fukurokuju has disdain for showing emotion and believes that being emotional will prevent one from ever being an effective shinobi, regardless of their skill in ninjutsu. Despite disdaining emotional expression, Fujurojuku would express panic and fear whenever Orochi is angry or in dangerous situations as he started panic when his robes caught fire while under Raizo's Paralysis technique. While vigilant in enforcing Orochi's objectives and protecting the shogun, he was patient enough to give Nico Robin one chance to explain herself when she was caught snooping around Orochi Castle.

Strangely, he calls himself \"Fukurou the Silent\", and not as strangely adds: \"Lover of Rumors\". He is also a prideful individual as he stopped dodging Franky's attacks after the latter accused him of being a coward and proceeded to trade punches with him. He also exchanged childish insults with the cyborg on how \"weak\" Franky's punches were while Franky was out of cola and later let Franky attack him with \"Strong Hammer\" after the latter was recharged with cola by Chopper, thinking that Franky's punch would be useless against his Tekkai which led him to be severely injured as the punch proved too strong for his defense. He is shown to care for his comrades as he panicked when Chopper locked Kumadori in a fridge and tried to free him and later, he worked hard along with his comrades to raise money to pay the fees for Lucci's treatment after he was seriously injured by Luffy. He also enjoyed spending time and doing activites together with them while in St. Poplar.", "abilities_and_powers": "From his training in the Rokushiki martial arts, Fukurou has great superhuman physical strength. With a Doriki of 800, he could punch with extreme force, able to damage Franky's cybernetically enhanced durability. He is extremely agile for his size, able to move at incredible speed when using Soru. He could perform Geppo with one leg, able to levitate both himself and Franky, a very heavy cyborg, when the latter was holding onto his other leg. He has vast endurance, able to withstand multiple powerful punches from Franky that can easily break his Tekkai and even a full Cola powered Strong Hammer that sent him flying.

Despite following his duty and arresting Jango due his status as a pirate, Fullbody spoke up for his friend after Jango was sentenced to death by hanging and accepted a demotion to Seaman Recruit in exchange for Jango being pardoned for his crimes, allowing Jango to enlist in the Marines. In addition to his friendship with Jango, Fullbody took care for the safety of innocent civilians, demonstrating that he is a noble person at heart and appears to adhere to Moral Justice over Absolute Justice. However despite his noble traits, he appears to hold a grudge against Sanji as he wishes to defeat and capture him (and by extension his fellow Straw Hats), though this desire to arrest and defeat Sanji may also be due out of his sense of duty as a Marine (as Sanji is a pirate and the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates) in addition to his desire to take revenge on Sanji for his humiliating defeat at the Baratie.", "abilities_and_powers": "So far Fullbody has yet to display any particular abilities, but is an adept fighter, using a fighting style similar to boxing. He is a strong fighter, as seen when he easily defeated Johnny and Yosaku, but outclassed by most of the stronger fighters (e.g Sanji) seen in the series thus far in terms of overall power. He also knows how to dance very well. During the Whitebeard War, unlike Jango, he did not succumb to Luffy's Haki, indicating that of the two he has the stronger will. He had previously been an effective fighter in the Marines, but after he paired up with Jango, he became a more goofy fighter; while still skilled in combat their silliness has been noted by Hina to be annoying."},

His nose is also colored red, and it is long just like the nose of Kaku and Usopp. These characteristics make him look like a fox. Foxy typically wears yellow-orange pants, held up by suspenders, with large, rotund buckles on the edges, tucked inside black boots, which are white on the front part of the legs and have orange strings. Under his pants some sort of strange indument circling his waist can be seen, which is light-green with leaf-like motifs on it, and has orange laces on the front. It might be some sort of belt, even though in the anime it was shown as a pair of bermuda-like indument. In front of this, threaded in his pants, Foxy carries around a short wooden sword, which he uses to perform his Noro Noro Beam Sword technique.

Foxy also seems to honor a team's choice if they were to decide to win on their own. He thinks very highly of himself and believes that he is good-looking. Though he acts supremely confident most of the time and seems quite fond of himself, Foxy is extremely sensitive to insults or criticism. Any offensive words from others cause him to instantly become depressed, and he usually ends up losing his footing and falling to the ground, barely supporting himself with his arms, while a black cloud suddenly appears over his head. Though all it takes is a few kind words from anybody to perk him up again.

He was an exceptionally large Fish-Man, with a broad and muscular physique, and extremely thick neck, and long legs that were quite thin in comparison to the rest of his body.

When he was younger, he did not have any peach fuzz above his lips, nor did he have his trademark beard, and his hair was shorter and notably straight. He donned what appeared to be a simple A-shirt.", "personality": "According to Boa Hancock, Tiger was a reckless person and very brutal, as he was believed to have challenged Mary Geoise and burned the entire city down to free all Fish-Man slaves. However, this was only due to Hancock's first impression, and contrary to it, Tiger was compassionate and very merciful. He did not approve of senseless violence, as he ordered Jinbe and Arlong not to kill any humans. He was very idealistic, making the principles of liberation and freedom the basics of the Sun Pirates, and worrying that Queen Otohime might have compared him to the bloodthirsty and cruel Arlong. Before he attacked Mary Geoise, he appeared to be friendly, greeting Jinbe and Arlong as close friends after returning to Fish-Man Island from an adventure. After the attack, he got more serious, yet remained friendly enough to treat others with respect. While Queen Otohime wished for interspecies cooperation between Fish-Men and humans, Tiger, up to the moment of his death, seemingly believed that Fish-Men and humans should remain separate. Even though he hated humans, according to Hancock, he did not discriminate against them when it came to slavery, and liberated every one of them during his raid of the holy city. He also did not believe in revenge on humans for their discrimination, thinking that it would only cause more hatred and resentment. His compassion to humans was further demonstrated when he vowed to take a child who was a former slave back to her hometown, going as far as to mark her with his own jolly roger to lift the burden of slavery off her back. Tiger did smile happily when Koala was reunited with her family, and it was an immensely symbolic final act for a man who had lived such a dualistic life as adventurer, hero, slave and pirate captain, as the town gladly accepted Koala back while condemning Tiger to death and betraying him to the Marines. There was also a darker side to Tiger's personality, as he claimed that the \"demons\" residing inside him were the most terrifying ones; a statement which left Jinbe blank, suggesting his crew did not know about this trait of him. This, along with the depths of his personality, were all revealed in his deathbed: after being captured and enslaved by the World Nobles and escaping, he saw the \"madness\" of humans, and grew to hate them for it. Despite this, he agreed with Otohime's ideology of improving relationships between the two races and regretted making it difficult with his own actions. He tried to befriend humans, but being betrayed by Koala's townspeople drove him to realize that no matter how much effort he put in, he could never love a human. To this end, he refused a transfusion of human blood due to it being tainted with hatred for Fish-Men. Since he could not accept humans despite trying his hardest, his last hope on changing the interspecies relationship was the next era, such as Koala, who does not know about the hatred, and asked his crew not to reveal the tragedy that befell the Sun Pirates, nor their hatred towards humanity.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tiger is a legendary figure among Fish-Men, known for his many feats and his amazing will. Without fearing the consequences of challenging the World Nobles and their guards, he proceeded to rampage across Mary Geoise and free all the slaves imprisoned there, including both fish-men and humans. Not only did he succeed in performing such an astonishing deed, he also founded and became the captain of the Sun Pirates, the strongest and largest pirate crew composed of fish-men to ever roam the Grand Line. It was from this group that several other Fish-Man pirate crews came from. His notoriety from the events at Mary Geoise and his status as the captain of the Sun Pirates eventually earned him a bounty of 230,000,000, an impressive feat, considering it was his first bounty. In his younger days, he was able to command the Fish-Men District with his strength and in the anime, he was also able to defeat both Arlong and Jinbe (who already had a black belt in Fish-Man Karate as a child) as well as the rest of his future crewmen to gain their loyalty. Even before achieving his legendary status, he was a famous adventurer in his own right and kept in high regard by the inhabitants of Fish-Man Island, who were more than willing to hear of his numerous adventures. During one such adventure, Tiger was taken as a slave by the World Nobles, and yet managed to escape, something which prompted him to attack Mary Geoise in order to free all the other slaves."},

{"name": "Eustass Kid", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Kid is a tall, muscular man with light skin and bright red hair, resembling flames. His nose has a particular shape, being quite pointed and having little protrusions on both sides. He has dark reddish, purple-colored lips and fingernails, red/orange eyes and no eyebrows. He dresses in an extravagant attire consisting of black and yellow lizard-print pants with a red fringe, motorcycle boots, and a blue sash under a green belt fastened by a large circular buckle with a four-leaf clover-like pattern in the middle. He also has a slim bandolier, also with minuscule bolts that go diagonally over his right shoulder then ties to his waist, where he keeps a dagger with a Japanese-style hilt and what appears to be a flintlock gun. He also has gold bangles around both wrists. He wears a pair of studded, square shaped goggles on his forehead, and a large fur captain's coat over his bare muscular torso. The dark brown coat is adorned with spikes on its shoulders lined in maroon. The collar of the coat is extremely flared and wide. He typically wears this coat with his right arm in its sleeve and his left arm under the coat itself. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Kid is shown with spikier and more spread-out hair, similar to a lion's mane. He also wore larger and rounder goggles and did not have dark lips. He was depicted tinkering with a toy robot with a wrench. His blue sleeveless shirt has a sewn patch, like his yellow striped pants, and has a patch. After the timeskip, he is shown with slightly longer hair that appears to be pushed back. He also has a large scar that drags from the left side of his forehead, goes down his neck and another smaller one that goes through his left eye. There are two parallel scars on his lower right arm also. He lost his left arm to just above the elbow during the two-year timeskip in a battle against the Red Hair Pirates, and until his imprisonment by the Beasts Pirates, he replaced it with a mechanical one that is somehow connected to his nervous system, shown by the presence of several metallic wires embedded directly into his skin. The mechanical arm was damaged in his fight against Kaidou, and later stripped from him to disarm him and put him at further disadvantage if he rebelled against his captor. His attire consists of his trademark spotted pants, a black opened vest, held down by a belted war kilt. He also has a long dark red coat, worn over his shoulders. He appears to have become more muscular and also has scars on his right forearm, left pectoral, and on the left side of his abdomen. He no longer wears any impractical jewelry. During the raid on Onigashima, he assembled a new mechanical arm. It was later temporarily severed due to Hawkins' damage transfer, but was ultimately repaired.", "personality": "Kid comes off as a rude, vicious and bloodthirsty pirate, notorious for causing huge amounts of civilian casualties. Whenever feeling like he is being mocked or insulted, even though a glance, he is quick to resort to violence. In fact, Kid can be so violent that he considers the choice of not immediately killing someone in his direct vicinity an act of gratitude. He also seems to be cruel even when not provoked, crucifying another defeated pirate crew just because he deemed them too weak to roam around in the New World. Kid is overall highly temperamental and has little patience with anyone getting in his way, although he is capable of restraining his anger in certain situations.Kid can also be very petty, having killed countless civilians for merely mocking or laughing at him for his dream of being the Pirate King, killing several pirates in the New World for being weak, and attempting to kill Shanks' fleet solely to goad the Emperor to fight him. Kid is bold, cocky and fearless, known to run into danger regardless of the consequences. This is particularly the case when dealing with people who previously wronged him, at which point Kid will throw all caution to the wind and go straight for revenge. He does not hesitate to challenge even the Four Emperors, having previously fought Kaidou and Shanks and destroyed two ships belonging to Big Mom. Kid rarely backs down from a battle and may fight a powerful enemy until his last breath. The fact that he did not join the Beasts Pirates despite not standing a chance against Kaidou is a testament to Kid's disposition. Kid seems to believe that possessing the determination to achieve the impossible is necessary to survive in the New World, and that anyone who does not is as good as dead. Kid is very prideful of his reputation and aims to reach a top spot in the world of piracy, which he plans to achieve by beating the Four Emperors, even if it means dying for it. That said, Kid has no interest in utilizing weapons of mass destruction (although he is curious about their existence) or other tools that could help him achieve those goals, instead just preferring to confront them head on with his own power. Because of this, he dislikes joining forces with others and sharing his targets with them, thinking that they will just interfere in what should be his fight alone. He also hates being the subject of false rumors that paint him in a negative light, being quick to clarify them if he overhears someone talking about him. Because of his pride, Kid is notorious for being unreasonably stubborn, unwilling to back down no matter how impossible the task is. Despite this stubbornness, Kid has shown moments of maturity, willing to put his pride aside to work with his fellow Worst Generation members in overthrowing the Emperors of the Sea. Kid is shown to be quite cynical about the World Government. He is not blind to the way the World Nobles act, remarking that, compared to them, pirates are almost humane in nature and honest about their faults, unlike the Nobles that justify their abuses of power through ancestry. After Camie had been sold in the Human Auctioning House to Charlos, Kid declared that the whole affair was a \"farce\" and similarly held a similar point of view regarding the broadcast of the Summit War of Marineford, calling it a \"charade\". For this reason, he felt amusement and catharsis when the world noble Charlos was punched down by an irate Luffy. Kid has the same dream as Luffy: to find One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Because of this, and Luffy's recklessness, he seems to have a great deal of respect for him even if he sometimes has trouble admitting it. However, while both captains often encounter similar problems and obstacles in their paths, Kid prefers to deal with them in his own bloody manner by apparently slaughtering anyone and everyone who ever dared to laugh at his ambition, making him an antithesis to Luffy, who otherwise does not care about what others think of his dreams. Surprisingly, belying his rough attitude, Kid can be childishly competitive and will mock his rivals any chance he gets, especially when Luffy and Law are involved. Another similarity Kid has to Luffy is a strong degree of affection for his crewmates. Kid will recklessly defend or rescue his subordinates if they are mocked or in danger. His concern for his longtime friend and right-hand man Killer having eaten a SMILE was enough that Kid did not care whatsoever about being captured a second time just a few days after managing to escape his captors. Kid is also rather gluttonous, not minding hard labor as long as he gets access to large amounts of food. Unlike Luffy, however, Kid is rather unfriendly and mistrusting of others, rarely leaving his guard down and warning his subordinates to follow suit. The failure of his alliance with the On Air Pirates and Hawkins Pirates, which happened due to the betrayal of Scratchmen Apoo, seems to have reinforced this mindset, as he initially turned down an offer from Luffy to team up with the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance. Kid would eventually change his mind, but still acted as a reluctant ally for the most part, only joining forces with Luffy for the sake of their rivalry. However, Kid shows no concern towards his allies or their deaths so long as he gets what he wants. This turns out to be a flaw of Kid, as during his rematch against Shanks and his fleet, Kid approached his fleet without any allies around to help him and it costs him and his crew their ship and their Road Ponyglyph rubbings because of his pride.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Kid Pirates, Kid has complete authority over the crew. As a member of the Worst Generation, he is a powerful pirate. Prior to the timeskip, he had a reward of 315,000,000, the highest among the Eleven Supernovae at the time, for dealing major destruction and civilian casualties along their route through the Grand Line and towards the New World. In the Human Auctioning House, he effortlessly defeated a large group of Marines alongside Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law. Later, he along with his crew also managed to escape from a Pacifista and Admiral Kizaru. After the timeskip, Kid appears to have become much more powerful, surviving the Red Hair Pirates to a battle and wounding one of Big Mom's Sweet Commanders, as well as later destroying two ships belonging to her. His bounty rose to 470,000,000. During the Raid on Onigashima, he has shown to be powerful enough to fight against the two Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom, dealing damage to them despite their near-impenetrable defenses. Later, Kid briefly faced Big Mom, in a singles match, before wrestling, alongside Law, in a match receiving Hawkins' damage. After she had been empowered with a year of her life, while wielding her special Homies, Hera, Prometheus, and Napoleon, all of whom had grown stronger and more in sync, the two Supernovas, often using their awakened powers managed to push Big Mom towards her limits and landing a devastating blow against the feared Emperor, resulting in her eventual defeat. Having defeated the former Emperor, Big Mom, Kid gained a bounty of 3,000,000,000, making him one of the most dangerous pirates in the world, with his new bounty matching that of the current Emperor and rival, Monkey D Luffy. However, in spite of his increase in strength, he still is no match for an Emperor head on, having been easily defeated by Shanks alone due to having overestimated his own strength compared to the Emperor, a mistake that potentially cost him and his crew their lives. Kid also appears well-connected, as he is aware of dealings within the underworld and knew about Caesar Clown's experiments. Additionally, Kid has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. Like Jinbe and Law, Kid is also immune to Big Mom's \"Soul Pocus\" due to his lack of fear towards the Emperor."},
{"name": "Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 1086.", "appearance": "Like his fellow Elders, Nusjuro is an extremely tall man of advanced age, with a pale-grayish complexion and neither head nor facial hair, compared to the other Elders who have beards and/or mustaches. He has a wrinkled face, a hook nose, thin eyebrows, and wears round, metal-frame glasses resembling the Windsor style. Clothing-wise, being the only Elder not to wear a suit, Nusjuro instead dons a white, loose-fitting keikogi held closed by a golden obi, but open enough to expose his chest and abdominals, and for footwear has beige geta sandals. Nusjuro's personal katana is always held in his hand instead of fastened to his obi.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Nusjuro cares about the balance in the world as orchestrated by the Three Great Powers and wishes to maintain it. He exercises meticulousness in perpetuating this balance, as he viewed the loss of even a single Warlord as important, and grew extremely concerned at the loss of three Warlords during the Summit War of Marineford. This also includes preserving the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret; the other Elders and himself will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. However, he was the first person to recognize that the current balance may not be sustainable after everything that has transpired since the Summit War of Marineford, suggesting a \"cleansing\" was in order. Nusjuro attributes the Will of D. to danger, and expressed discomfort that said name came to the knowledge of many. Nusjuro seems to have some familiarity with Zunesha, Zou, and Wano Country; he knew that the elephant's departure from the latter was a confirmation that Wano's borders had not been opened. Nusjuro also seems to be quite callous, showing no regard for the casualties caused by Imu's order to test the Mother Flame on Lulusia Kingdom. He instead showed more interest in them being able to use the Mother Flame's power freely. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Five Elders, Nusjuro is one of the few to have the \"highest authority of the World Government\", being above even the World Nobles. He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great influence and power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is Imu."},

{"name": "Enel", "episode": "Episode 254", "chapter": "Chapter 167", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned by Conis in Chapter 241.", "appearance": "Enel is a pale-skinned man with a well-toned yet somewhat wiry build, standing very tall at 266cm (8'9\"). He has a slim face, usually seen with a relaxed, half-lidded expression accentuated by a calm, confident smile. He has blond hair (platinum blond in the anime, a slightly darker shade in the manga) that is set in a large perm, albeit always tucked under a close-fitting, white skullcap. His eyebrows are contrastively black, rather thick, and top grayish-blue eyes with prominent bottom lashes. His nose is slim with a marked, flat bridge that has several lines run horizontally across it. Akin to depictions of buddhas, Enel's earlobes stretch all the way to his chest (or well below as per inconsistent portrayal, though generally longer in the manga) due to being weighed down by gold earrings with diamond-shaped pendants, which in the manga hold fitted red gems in the middle. Upon his back, stuck centrally into his shoulder blades is a large, gray ring (in place of Birkan wings) and attached to it four wooden shime-daiko drums set next to and above his head (inconsistently shown as either larger or smaller than such), each with cream-colored drum skin depicting a black mitsudomoe on the front and back, based on the drum ring associated with the Japanese thunder deity Raijin; similarly to said god's thunder creation, Enel can use those drums a medium for his electrokinesis. Enel takes to wearing a simple yet sumptuous-looking outfit, matching his \"godly\" self-image. Fond of gold, he dons plain, rigid bracelets of said material  a quadruple set worn like bangles on each forearm  and above each bare foot a wide, pearl-edged gold anklet double-lined in the middle, plus two gold rings on each hallux. Otherwise, bare above the waist, Enel's only garments are on the legs: a flowing, indigo (purple in the manga) sash encircles his waist, knotted in a small half-bow at his right hip, with one end of it hanging to near-ground level. This sash upholds a dark turquoise (lighter-blue in the manga) fabric around his waist as a wraparound skirt, draping over the back and in the front, where it slightly overlaps, forming a large divide to show off Enel's pants below. Said pants are extremely baggy, ballooning ones gathered quite a bit below the knees with separate brown, short cuffs each holding a small, gold-buckled strap of light blue. Each pant leg is patterned in bright orange: many longish, rectangular (more so obround in the anime) shapes touching in a slanting position, forming three separate rows of which the lowest comes out the cuff; the upper and middle row each tops a single row of spaced dots, numbering fewer than the aforesaid shapes, and the rest of the pants is dark bluish (black in the manga). Eight years before the beginning of the story when overthrowing Gan Fall, Enel looked the same except for his skirt piece being green and his pants being differently patterned: three black, horizontal lines with several thin spikes jutting up and down from each (the ones from one line offset to those from another so that they touched not) on orange background; in the anime, the pants instead had horizontal line pairs running close to each other and kinking up and down to form square-pointed diamond outlines.", "personality": "Enel thinks of himself as an invincible god. He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take, or destroy whatever he pleases and is capable of doing anything. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, arrogant, and without a care in the world. Enel holds no regard for any life except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands - instead, he sees it as his godly duty, and laughed maniacally as he tried to send Skypiea to its doom. He is, in short, an amoral narcissist with a God complex, which became even more obvious when he set off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his \"godly duties\" of smiting the natives of Skypiea for speaking against him, he spends his time sleeping or eating in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he is hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he is relaxed and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight in order to prove his immortality and superiority. Sometimes, against an annoying opponent like Usopp using his \"Usopp Spell\", he simply bludgeons them with his staff rather than shocking them. Due to Enel's overconfidence in his abilities in combat, unexpected scenarios throw him completely off-guard, disrupting his Mantra and therefore, impacting his fighting skill. This was shown when he desperately tried to persuade Wyper not to use the reject dial, and when he noticed that Luffy is immune to lightning, he was completely lost and visibly horrified. Nevertheless, he also gives some recognition. He was impressed with Robin's knowledge of the golden city, and he told Luffy that he was very courageous when he met him on the ark. Enel uniquely alternates between three different first person pronouns: ware (), ore (), and watashi (). Like many people, Enel has a unique laugh, with a stressed \"ya\" at the beginning: \"Yahahaha\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As a God of Skypiea, Enel had full control of the island. Enel is extremely powerful, although he appeared to be weaker than many characters as powerful as he is due to the fact that Luffy had complete immunity to most of Enel's lightning-based attacks, and was even able to strike Enel, thanks to his rubber powers. However, against almost everyone else in Skypiea, Enel appeared to be invincible as he easily defeated every opponent he faced. Enel's strength was first demonstrated when he effortlessly defeated Kamakiri and shortly after defeating another Shandia, Raki. While Wiper came close to killing Enel by using seastone and a Reject Dial, Enel was able to restart his heart and defeat Wiper."},

{"name": "Franky", "episode": "Episode 329", "chapter": "Chapter 233", "year": 2004, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 335. His birth name, Cutty Flam, was revealed in Chapter 346.", "appearance": "As a direct result of the modifications that he conducted upon himself as well as the years spent as a ship dismantler, bounty hunter, and street thug in Water 7, Franky is a powerfully built man with a height of at least seven feet, making him the third-tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, after Jinbe and Brook. His forearms are relatively enormous while his biceps are comparably small. His chest is well-toned with large abs and pectoral muscles. He has brightly colored blue hair and blue star tattoos on his forearms. Franky's eyebrows are rather long and stern, and he has three prominent lower Matsuge on each eye. His chin is very angular and tapers off in three pointed clefts. Franky has an equally angular prosthetic nose made of iron with several rivets and jagged edges, the only replacement part of his exterior body that is not covered in artificial skin. Before being hit by the Puffing Tom, Franky's forearms were normal-sized, and his overall height was comparably smaller than his cyborg-enhanced self would be. He also had an ordinary nose and chin, both of which were later badly broken in the accident, causing him to repair them with iron. His choice of clothing usually comprises of a swim briefs, which causes people to call him a pervert, and an open loud Hawaiian \"Aloha\" shirt with a large golden chain necklace around his neck. It is rare for him to button up his shirt, have long sleeves, and wear pants or footwear unless the situation calls for it, or someone makes him do so. He also does not like it when people tamper with his look, as seen when Nami's mind was inside his body and she tried to button up his Hawaiian shirt, which made Franky upset. Before becoming a cyborg, Franky went half-dressed simply because he wanted to. Now, his cyborg body is built in a way that covering himself up actually limits him from accessing its features (long sleeves prevent him from using weapons installed on his arms, a buttoned shirt stops him from accessing his chest panels, pants keep him from using features on his legs that cause them to separate or expand, shoes are a hindrance for the same reason and also redundant because his feet are toughened with iron). If in a battle, Franky will strip down for the sake of using his weapons or wear specially modified clothing that can transform along with him. Conversely, Franky always makes sure to cover his back (hence, he wears a shirt) because it is a weak spot- it is still flesh and blood, the only part of his body he cannot reach and modify. Unfortunately, Franky is still susceptible to cold and can suffer chills from his half-nakedness. During his first appearance in the Water 7 Arc, Franky wore a masked costume as a disguise so no one could identify him while he bought wood from the Adam tree off the black market. After discarding this disguise, for the rest of the arc all the way up to the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a red Hawaiian shirt, with lime green palm trees decorating it. During the Thriller Bark Arc, Franky wore a yellow shirt with purple trident-like symbols on the sides and a large one on back. Near the end of the previous arc all the way up to the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Franky switched to wearing a purple version of his Hawaiian shirt. During the Straw Hats separation, Franky wore a red coat to protect himself from the cold while on Baldimore, but after blowing up Vegapunk's laboratory, the skin on his face and frontal body was burned off, revealing his metal endoskeleton underneath, which he covered up with a tiger skin rug due to scaring people who looked at him. He also has a pair of sunglasses, which he usually wears when things start to get serious.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates, Franky is an extremely valuable asset for the crew since he maintains the Thousand Sunny's condition, along with the other vehicles, instruments, or weapons the Straw Hats may employ. He is also an accomplished surgeon, as he was able to operate on himself twice, even though Franky does not specialize in the field: an especially notable feat, as Franky was close to death when he did so the first time. In terms of combat ability, Franky is one of the most dangerous Straw Hats, a feat acknowledged by the World Government given his current bounty of 394,000,000. By combining his immense physical prowess with his advanced bionic enhancements, Franky took down two CP9 agents - Nero and Fukurou, the latter a master of Rokushiki. After studying on Karakuri Island for two years and returning to his crew, Franky's considerable fighting skills significantly increased, in tandem with his engineering abilities. Franky emerged victorious over three officers of the formidable Donquixote Pirates: Baby 5, Buffalo, and Senor Pink, easily defeated the Energy Steroid-enhanced fish-man, Ikaros Much, and knocked out Jaki, an inebriated ancient giant, with a single attack. It was only against Sasaki, one of the Beasts Pirates' Tobiroppo and an Ancient Zoan user with a bounty of 472,000,000, that Franky was temporarily overwhelmed, though the cyborg was able to land a finishing attack after a lengthy, harsh battle. Additionally, Franky has considerable skills in playing the guitar.", "personality": "Franky is an exhibitionist and a self-proclaimedpervert. He isstrong-willed, eccentric, free-spirited, and often has a blatant disregard for rules and norms. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants, though he usually wants little more than to build powerful ships or protect those he cares about and at times can appear very eccentric compared to most of the crew because of his strange mannerisms and knack for building odd things (such as his Franky Centaur). He is also highly self-aggrandizing, reveling in how \"SUPER\" he is and how brilliant his body or inventions are. Despite his strange and goofy behavior, Franky has demonstrated himself to be among the most mature and reliable of the Straw Hats, making an effort to entertain young crewmates while still keeping serious matters in mind. Depending on the situation and the people he is dealing with, Franky can be quite an altruist, as he is quick to defend other people and take action if his friends are harmed; he also holds the belief that no matter what a person is like, they should never be prejudiced or exterminated simply because of who they are. This often causes him to befriend and defend the wrongfully feared and persecuted."},

When in the arena, he wears gold boxing gloves.", "personality": "Elizabello II apparently likes combat and has earned the nickname \"Fighting King\" for it. He seems to be very proud and arrogant as he stated that the formation formed during the Corrida Colosseum B Block match was to protect the other gladiators from him and not the other way around. However, given the destructive capabilities of his King Punch, these words were hardly empty, being more realistic than arrogant. He seemed very much unfazed when he was defeated, simply stating that he had done his part. He is quite prideful as he was annoyed when Zoro referred to him as 'the king of somewhere or other' due to forgetting the name of Prodence. Additionally, he was further aggravated when he used his full power King Punch only to blow away the rubble from Pica's stone statue form after Zoro sliced it apart. His reason for his intense training is so he can be powerful enough to protect his people. He also wishes to form peaceful and friendly relationships with other countries.

{"name": "Emporio Ivankov", "episode": "Episode 537", "chapter": "Chapter 438", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Bentham in Chapter 532.", "appearance": "Ivankov is a large man with an afro of indigo hair, and has long eyelashes, he also has a noticeably odd-shaped chin resembling an arrowhead. His afro is large enough to hold people inside it. He has a personal Jolly Roger tattooed just below his chest. As an okama, he dresses in reddish-purple woman's leotard with a high collar and a deep V-neck that reaches down to his belly. He wears matching gloves and boots, as well as a pearl necklace. He wears a net cape on his back and matching net leggings. He also wears heavy, but tasteful makeup. To signify his queen-ship of New Kama Land, he wears a queen's crown with a king's crown on top. Using his Emporio Female Hormones on himself, Ivankov can become a large-sized, relatively curvy woman. This form is more realistically proportioned (relatively speaking) than his male form and is rather well endowed. Because of the clothes he wears as an Okama, this form is also scantily dressed. Despite the changes brought on by the hormones, however, he is still incredibly tall and is at least twice, if not three times the size of the Impel Down officer Sadi. While in a flashback as a Revolutionary, Iva has been seen wearing a cloak, and without the crown. In the anime, when Iva turns into a woman, he keeps his male voice, unlike the other characters who are changed by his powers, although his voice sounds slightly different between male and female.", "personality": "As an Okama, Iva is an effeminate cross-dressing man. He also has a tendency to put \"buru\" at the end of a sentence as well as pronounce \"watashi\" and \"anata\" with a v (vatashi and vanata). He also tends to sometimes proclaim the exact opposite of a statement he has just said, with people believing this is his sense of humor, such as saying that he would not mind being called \"Crap\", before hastily announcing that he would not be referred to as such. He is noted for not being picky on what Japanese honorific someone can use when addressing him. Being one who follows the way of the Okama, Iva strongly values friendship and bonds above all else. He seems to find great motivation at helping both friends and subordinates and is ready to put his life on the line for their sake, as seen when he flew into a rage against Kuma when the latter attacked his \"candies\". Due to this trait, Ivankov willingly saved Luffy and Bentham when they were on the verge of death after being touched by Luffy's selflessness and pleading to save Bentham. He also believes that people should be what they want to be whether it be a man, woman, or Okama. He is very loud and open, even perverse, about his ideals as well. He does not care about other people's objections to his views, as was seen when he even turned a man who tries to kill him into a woman, after the man (now woman) was embarrassed by his ordeal and had previously stated he objected to Ivankov's views. He states that as a prisoner of Impel Down, he is not such a good person as he would not save someone's life. However, when touched by the words of friendship and hope, he considers their life worth saving. He thinks that \"miracles\" only come to those who never give up and therefore should not be taken lightly of and nor should those who can muster within themselves to produce such also be looked down upon. He also dislikes people who rely on others to save them, and believes they are not worth being saved. According to him, he always questions the \"Will to Live\" of nations he saved. Additionally, he also seems to be perceptive, being able to tell a person's physical health condition after observing them for a short while; Ivankov's intelligence also extends to being able to estimate what \"toll\" his Devil Fruit power upon those he uses it on as well as noticing Dragon's habit of looking towards the East Blue when the wind blows, and correctly assumed it was because his family was there. Before his meeting with Luffy, he did not express interest in breaking out of prison. He stated that he will escape when Dragon and the revolutionaries would take down the World Government. However, when Ivankov learned that Luffy was Dragon's son, he decided to help Luffy rescue Ace, considering his duty to his \"personal compatriot\", Dragon. He has a hatred towards anyone who has forgotten him, claiming that no one could possibly forget his face. He also tends to call people by their name or nickname (or part of it) followed with \"boy\" (, bi?), like calling Mr. 2 Bon Kurei \"Bon-boy\", Luffy as \"Straw Hat-boy\", and Crocodile \"Croco-boy\". Iva often shouts \"Hee-Haw!\" (, Hh?); in the Shonen Jump translation, he shouts \"Woo-Hoo!\". Like other characters in One Piece, Ivankov has his own laughter style: Mmmfufufu (, nfufufu?).", "abilities_and_powers": "He is considered the greatest okama in the world. As queen of Kamabakka Kingdom, Iva controls an island of male transvestites, which gives him a similar status on par with Boa Hancock, who rules over Amazon Lily. In Impel Down, he set up his new kingdom (or queendom) called New Kama Land and commanded a small army of \"New Kama Okama\" followers, all of whom were former prisoners. Following the war, he returned to Kamabakka Kingdom along with his New Kama Land followers, uniting his 2 king/queendoms. As a commander of the Revolutionaries, Iva has control over the lower ranking members of the army. He appears to have considerable skills as a leader, evident by his ability to unite the rag-tag group of unruly inmates that strayed away and eventually found themselves in New Kama Land under his command. In contrast to his rather comical appearance, Ivankov is a powerful fighter should the need arise. His strength is great enough to allow him to fight on equal terms with the completely transformed Pacifista, Warlords of the Sea Bartholomew Kuma. He was able to easily defeat (without any visible damage) Sanji, one of the Straw Hats' top fighters. Upon encountering Crocodile in Impel Down, he also mentioned that he could defeat the former Warlord if necessary. Another helpful, if comical, asset Ivankov has is that he wears a great deal of make-up, enough to essentially create a \"mask\" which was able to completely shield his face from Magellan's corrosive poison and Akainu's magma in the anime, though in the latter case, it did not prevent him from getting hurt as he fainted soon afterwards. Ivankov also appears to have some knowledge regarding Haki, having asked Luffy about it at the final stages of the battle at Marineford, and the fact that he was able to retain his consciousness after Luffy unleashed a surge of Haoshoku Haki throughout Marineford (that incapacitated both Marine and pirate alike) despite being so close to the boy while running side by side with him suggests remarkable willpower on Ivankov's part."},
{"name": "Edward Weevil", "episode": "Episode 802", "chapter": "Chapter 751", "year": 2015, "note": "He was first mentioned by Brannew in Chapter 700.

He has bushy blond hair with two braids coming down either side of his face and similar to his self-proclaimed father, has a black bandanna and white crescent-shaped mustache which is thinner and even longer than Edward Newgate's. His legs are disproportionately small for his build and his nose also appears to be perpetually runny, evocative of his simple-minded nature. He wears overalls that are hung by chains rather than straps and bear his personal jolly roger on them. Incidentally, from behind, his appearance is similar to that of Oars or Little Oars Jr., with his large build, thick mane of hair, and his exaggeratedly long mustache which (from behind) resembles horns. They even share jagged teeth, square jaw and a scar running down the left side of their face, as well as stick-like legs in comparison to the rest of their bodies.", "personality": "Edward Weevil is a violent man as he left destruction in his wake when hunting Whitebeard's crew and allies. He is not very intelligent, shown by the fact he had a hard time telling the difference between a mirror and a photograph (even though the only similarity is the mustache). As a result, he is constantly manipulated by his mother, making him believe that he is the rightful heir of the Whitebeard Pirates' fortune, not the members of the Whitebeard Pirates, to whom he believed (influenced by his mother) are unworthy. He also talks in a whiny, snot-nosed manner, making him sound both infantile and highly unintelligent. Though his claims are widely doubted, at the very least he seems to genuinely believe them to be true. Unlike his alleged father, Weevil does not hold concepts of family in the same regard, believing that his alleged blood heritage is what makes him true family, not bonds built on friendship and camaraderie. Because of this, he violently attacked all those once affiliated with Whitebeard. Regardless, he was shown to have protected Whitebeard's hometown Sphinx. He also holds grudges, as he wanted to avenge his alleged father's death upon Blackbeard, but was convinced by his mother that revenge is not important. Despite his destructive behavior, Weevil is shown to be honorable when he saved Sphinx and its inhabitants from the Marines since it was the native home of his alleged father.", "abilities_and_powers": "Weevil's powers have been praised by Borsalino who compared his abilities to that of a younger Whitebeard, his alleged father. He was able to single-handedly defeat 16 pirate crews affiliated with Whitebeard, including the A O Pirates. When the Marines attempted to arrest Weevil after the Seven Warlord was abolished, Weevil completely wiped out the all the Marines sent to capture him. When he later appeared on Sphinx to protect it, the Marines there quickly retreated in fear of the former Warlords power. While he was no match for Admiral Ryokugyu, he at least survived the brutal Admirals attack."},

{"name": "Edward Newgate", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned by Smoker in Chapter 157. Better known by his epithet Whitebeard.", "appearance": "In his younger days, Newgate wore an open dark gray vest and a black bandanna, and his trademark mustache was nonexistent. Later in his life, he grew the prominent crescent-shaped mustache, which would spawn his epithet, \"Whitebeard\". When he was 52, he wore a white and yellow pirate hat with his jolly roger on it over a black bandana with black and red, both worn over long, blond flowing hair he had back then. Whitebeard was an abnormally large man, with a height of 666cm (21'10\"). Unlike other large-sized humans, however, he was well-proportioned. He had a long face, ploughed because of the advanced age with many wrinkles around his eyes, and many scars running along his chest, and was very muscular. The muscles on his biceps seemed to grow bigger whenever he used his quake-based powers. Like all of his men, he had his own Jolly Roger tattooed on his back. In the manga, his eyes are brown, but in the anime, his eye color is seen to be yellow. He wore a black bandanna around his head and adorned himself with a white captain's coat, which hung loosely from his broad shoulders and bore his Jolly Roger symbol. He was always seen bare-chested, and wore light, loose pants tucked inside his large black boots, and a dark pirate sash around his waist. While not in battle, Whitebeard was typically on oxygen and attached to several medical sensor machines, due to health issues concerning his age. In the manga, after Akainu melted off a portion of his head, Whitebeard lost his left eye and the left side of his mustache (this was changed to just losing the left side of his mustache in the anime) as well as a massive hole in his torso (a second, bigger hole in the stomach was also dealt by Akainu in the anime). However, for the entire 72 years that he lived, he had never once received a wound on his back because he never ran away from his battles. As a child, he wore a light-colored sleeveless shirt with the word \"Power\" (, Chikara?) written on it. He also wore shorts and a white bandanna. He had bandaged scrapes and cuts from his fights.", "personality": "Edward Newgate was a cheerful and carefree person during his younger years, prior to commanding his own ship and becoming known as Whitebeard. Due to being an orphan who grew up in poverty, Newgate had a strong desire for a family, which he saw as the greatest treasure one could have. Despite his peers considering this to be strange and humorous, Newgate was never ashamed of this wish. His reign on the sea, reputation, and foreboding power made him seemingly overconfident and fearless. In initial appearances, he seemed unable to see any cause for alarm on any decision he made and refused all advice given to him, such as his nurse telling him not to drink heavily or Shanks warning him of Blackbeard. However, he was much more thoughtful than he initially appeared to be. Actions that initially seemed to be the result of thoughtless, headstrong bravado actually had strong reasons behind them; his loud declaration that Fish-Man Island belonged to him freed the island from all invading pirates and slavery, and his insistence that Blackbeard be punished was merely a cover for Ace, who had set out after him against Whitebeard's wishes. Though he may seem to have an overgrown ego, Whitebeard knew deep down that he was nothing but a single man and was fully aware of his own mortality. He knew that the youth were the keys to the future, and that their lives were far more important than his own. Because of this, he was not afraid of sacrificing himself for the safety of those he considered his children. Like Gol D. Roger, Whitebeard believed that a child should not be responsible for their parents' sins. Yet another belief he held is that any path a man wished to follow in life was fine by him, as long as they did not regret it. Despite his fierce reputation, Whitebeard was a compassionate man, having adopted countless people of different backgrounds into his crew as his foster children, such as Squard, whose life was devastated by Roger killing his crew, or Teach, who requested to join his crew due to being homeless. Marco stated that the main reason the Whitebeard Pirates held such strong loyalty to their captain was due to Newgate's paternal-like attitude, deeply caring for them like a father. Contrary to the tyrannical Kaidou and Charlotte Linlin, Whitebeard used his power and influence as one of the Four Emperors for humanitarian purposes. He liberated and protected Fish-Man Island from slavery, an act which touched the hearts of the normally human-distrusting citizens of Ryugu Kingdom and invested the majority of his riches to support his homeland of Sphinx, an once poor, lawless island. Whitebeard was understanding and forgiving of his subordinates, going to great lengths to rescue any who were in great danger, no matter the cost. Whitebeard was naturally protective of his family and did not tolerate the idea of letting a crewmate join someone else's crew, especially a rival one. In fact, the notion of separating himself from just one of them and for a short time infuriated him. Even if he did accept doing so, it was reluctantly and while showing much annoyance. Whitebeard was very careful about choosing a person to be included in his crew, depending on their personality and nature. This cautiousness mainly stemmed from his time as a member of the Rocks Pirates, as the violent and poor relationship among the members of that crew left a negative impact on Whitebeard. For this reason, Whitebeard was fully against letting someone like Kozuki Oden join his crew, since the Samurai was rebellious by nature. Still, Whitebeard showed enough open-mindedness to give Oden a chance to prove himself in a challenge and eventually allowed the Kuri daimyo to be part of his crew after the latter prioritized the life of an innocent woman over the challenge itself. Also, while he held reserves regarding Marshall D. Teach, he nevertheless allowed the boy to join his crew for being an orphan with nowhere else to go; this turned out to be a mistake that Whitebeard would come to regret. A distinguishing feature of Whitebeard's nature was his high moral standards: he never forgave the death of a crewmate by another and believed that a man could not live without some form of honor code. When confronted by Blackbeard, he intended to avenge Thatch, despite being close to death at the time. However, he was willing to go against his personal code under certain circumstances, if he felt the risk would not be worth the safety of his crew. Whitebeard seemed to enjoy talking about the past; when Shanks visited his ship, the first thing Newgate did was recollect his memories from the last twenty-two years, particularly those involving old rivals like Roger, Garp and Sengoku. People that were children at that time were still viewed as children in Whitebeard's eyes, no matter how powerful they had grown since. Despite fond memories of his time as a pirate captain, Whitebeard was not proud of his former association with the Rocks Pirates due to the lack of camaraderie among members, thus he rarely referred to those times unless in a negative tone. Regardless of his poor health at the time, Whitebeard liked drinking, to the point that bringing and sharing a drink with him (preferably of high quality and very expensive) was viewed as enough of a respectful gesture to engage a conversation. This was seen in his encounters with Shanks, Gol D. Roger, and Shiki; still, this did not guarantee complete cooperation from him, judging from the nature of these conversations. Like other characters in One Piece, he had a unique laugh, which was \"Gu ra ra ra ra\". Like Perona, his laugh is similar to the name of his Devil Fruit, the Gura Gura no Mi. However, in the anime (before the Marineford Arc) and Gigant Battle, his laugh was changed to a regular \"Ha ha ha ha ha\". In the American Shonen Jump, his laugh is changed to \"Gu ha ha ha ha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Whitebeard was one of the most powerful pirates in history. In his prime, he was one of the few able to take on the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, battling him for days to a draw. Due to his incredible strength, he was already feared as the \"Strongest Man in the World\", before Roger's death and the start of Great Age of Pirates. After Roger's death, Whitebeard became one of the Four Emperors, the four most powerful pirates in the world and the rulers of the New World. In fact, among them, he was considered the \"Closest Man to One Piece\", and the ruler of the sea who stood before the \"throne\" and the title of Pirate King. As a testament to this, Whitebeard held not only the highest bounty among his peers, but the second highest in recorded history, at over 5 billion (only behind Roger's own). Kaidou, who is renowned as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Whitebeard in the same elite class as other legendary pirates, that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Roger, Kozuzki Oden, Shanks, and their former captain. Even in his old age, he was able to effortlessly defeat Ace over a hundred times, even once while he was sleeping. During the Summit War of Marineford, Newgate's health was declining at a rapid rate due to his refusal to go into battle with life support and medication, despite this, he was able to engage in combat with Aokiji, Kizaru, and Akainu on even terms. After Akainu killed Ace, Whitebeard brutally injured the Admiral in retaliation, with the latter being practically helpless in response to Whitebeard's power, temporarily defeating him in a relatively short battle with a mere two hits, causing immense destruction all around. Whitebeard's reputation alone made his simple declaration of Fish-Man Island being his territory enough to keep slave traders and pirates from attacking the island further, making Whitebeard himself far more effective than the treaty signed with the World Government 200 years before his death. People from every ocean were aware of the Emperor's power and seemingly believed that he could end the world if he so wished. Few would dare to challenge him or any of his crew, which makes Ace, Crocodile, Aokiji, Akainu, Blackbeard, Kaidou, and Luffy very brave and powerful people, for just trying. After his death, the entire world fell into chaos: with total victory declared for the Marines and all of Whitebeard's territories no longer considered dangerous (despite the fact that his crew was still alive). As a true testament to his strength and reputation, the World Government was prepared to use practically the entire Marine force and the Seven Warlords of the Sea to fight Newgate and his crew, with Sengoku even remarking that their victory was not guaranteed due to Whitebeard's overwhelming power."},

{"name": "Duval", "episode": "Episode 491", "chapter": "Chapter 386", "year": 2008, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 492.", "appearance": "Duval is a very large man who was originally introduced wearing a large mask, with long red tufts attached to it, giving him his epithet Iron Mask Duval. While standing, he appears around two and a half times a normal person's height. He has a muscular torso, but has skinny arms and legs. Besides his head and shoulders which are covered in armor, he wears an open leather jacket, black pants, cowboy boots, and a long fur cape. Underneath his iron mask, Duval surprisingly looked exactly like Sanji's first wanted poster. Except for his eyebrow, which swirls downward instead of upward like Sanji's, he was an exact duplicate of the drawing. Because of this appearance, he had a lot of trouble with the Marines and bounty hunters, and thus had to conceal his face in order to protect himself. Duval received a lot of injuries because of this; his most devastating one is a scar on his back, which he states is very painful. He had this exact face since he was born, and even made his parents think he was an ugly baby due to the dawn of the Golden Age of Pirates. Upon confronting Sanji in order to get revenge, Duval got his entire facial structure rearranged by Sanji's kicks. The result of such a crude and violent operation was a complete successful makeover. Due to Sanji's kicks, Duval's entire face had been rearranged into a handsome one almost completely different from the one he originally had (his only leftover features are very tiny spirals still visible on the ends of his eyebrows). He absolutely loves it for the benefits it gives. Though turned handsome, Duval however has a hard time winking and thus his eyes would often not blink in unison. This might also be because he's never had to wink before, as implied by Sanji. Pleased with his new appearance, Duval's been calling himself \"Handsome\".", "personality": "In order to protect himself from the countless bounty hunters and Marines who mistook him for Sanji when the bounty poster came out, Duval decided to hide his face behind an iron mask. Having been scarred both physically and emotionally from his pursuers and the fact that he could no longer go out in broad daylight without having to conceal himself, Duval felt that a great injustice was dealt to him by Sanji. He felt that Sanji dealt a great wound to him and that the cook had stolen his life. Since then Duval developed a deep grudge against the Straw Hats and vowed to have his revenge for his unfortunate tragedy. Duval's hatred for Sanji is so strong that any mention of him drives Duval absolutely ballistic and will cause Duval to rant about his hatred and planned revenge for Sanji until he is calmed down. He becomes so emotional at the matter that it creates quite a scene. Also while Duval talks normally most of the time, whenever he gets angry at the mention of Sanji, his \"accent\" comes out. His accent resembles a type of Japanese accent which when translated can be akin to that used by country folk. This accent is so different than the one he uses when he talks calmly that everyone, even his men and the Macro Pirates, notice it. He had his accent from birth, even when he was just crying and was unable to talk yet. He is also rather slow as the entire time he held a grudge against Sanji he never thought of simply changing his own appearance (even giving a \"why didn't I think of that\" look and pose when this was angrily pointed out by Sanji). Duval nursed this deep hatred against Sanji until the chef rearranged his face with a barrage of kicks. Upon waking up from Sanji's operation on his face and seeing the results, Duval instantly loved the work. Not only did this new face mean that he would no longer be chased but it was also extremely handsome. Because of this, his entire outlook on life changed for the positive and all his past grudges were washed away. Unfortunately for people because of this face, he also became extremely vain and narcissistic. He became so narcissistic, that he would say \"handsome\" instead of his name in some sentences such as in, \"Wait up, it's me handsome\" or \"Hello, I'm handsome,\" and even has his gang refer to him as Handsome.

For two whole years, he managed to protect the Thousand Sunny from the Marines alongside the Rosy Life Riders, Hatchan, and Bartholomew Kuma. He is not as skilled as Sanji, having been felled by the latter in an instant after Duval challenged him in a one-on-one fight. He is highly experienced in the art of kidnapping, despite not wanting to be in the profession in the first place, and he along with his group rely on heavily coordinated attacks to subdue otherwise powerful foes that they could not overcome on their own.

He also possessed an immense level of durability thanks to his very hard scales, protecting him from Luffy's powerful punches. However, his underbelly was unprotected and much more vulnerable. His durability was further evidenced by his survival after a massive fallout on the island that covered it in poisonous gas, as well as the fight between Akainu and Aokiji that changed the entire climate of the island; for the next two years the dragon lived in the scorching heat of the Burning Lands and continued serving his post without issue."},

As a demonstration of his strength, he fought on a par with Brogy for a hundred years and together with the latter he managed to defeat such great creatures that not even the other giants of their crew would have been able to capture. The strength of the two giants is in fact such that Galdino, a member of Baroque Works who is capable of defeating a pirate with a bounty of 42,000,000, said he could in no way defeat them without resorting to deception, even with the help from Miss Golden Week, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine."},
{"name": "Dracule Mihawk", "episode": "Episode 49", "chapter": "Chapter 23", "year": 1998, "note": "He was first mentioned by Gin in Chapter 48 under his epithet. He was formally introduced in Chapter 50.", "appearance": "Mihawk is a tall, lean, and muscular man with black hair, a short beard, mustache and sideburns that point upwards. His nickname comes from his strangely colored red eyes (yellow in the anime), which resemble a hawk's eyes. Mihawk wears black and red ornate clothing with a crucifix pendant that hides a little dagger, which gives him the appearance of a Spanish swordsman. His attire consists of a wide-brimmed black hat decorated with a large plume, and a long, open black coat with a red velvet inside with no shirt underneath, with red, flower-patterned sleeves and collar. He wears white (light purple in the anime) pants held up by a decorated belt and tucked inside overly large boots in comparison to his leg size. Mihawk wears a kogatana around his neck, appearing as a golden cross-shaped necklace which is a dagger which looks identical to its larger counterpart Yoru, and carries his sword Yoru on his back when he is not using it. At his home in Kuraigana Island's castle, Mihawk sports different pants and an open white shirt with a ruffled neck. When he met up with Zoro outside, he had a plain dark cloak draped over his shoulders. After the timeskip, Mihawk shows some more wrinkles near the eyes. While reading about the Straw Hats' actions on Dressrosa and resulting new bounties, he was seen in his casual outfit along with a dark scarf draped over his shoulders and a wide brimmed straw hat. Twenty-four years ago, during Gol D. Roger's execution, Mihawk did not have his beard, nor did he wear his hat, and his hair was scruffier and shorter. He already had his crucifix pendant and sported what looked like a flower-patterned jacket. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Mihawk is shown with many scratches and bruises from training. He used a bokken as his weapon. He dressed in a dark-colored open jacket, short pants, shoes and a light-colored belt.", "personality": "Mihawk is mostly very serious. He rarely smiles, and he has only been seen laughing twice so far. He took the revelation about Luffy being Dragon's son in stride, despite the surprise of those around him. He never unnecessarily reveals emotions on the battlefield, even when something unexpected happens (such as Jozu intercepting his flying slash aimed at Whitebeard, or Luffy surviving his onslaught). As an infamous pirate, he is not someone ambitious or cruel and his only goal in life is to be outmatched by another swordsman. He displays a sense of honor as he recognizes and respects the swordsman's code and he even reluctantly permitted Roronoa Zoro the luxury of training at his hand for his dedication and selflessness. He is also unafraid to reference his title of \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\" in relation to himself, indicating a high level of confidence in his own abilities. He takes pride in his swordsmanship, believing that a nick on his sword is a blemish to his pride. Though he is confident in his strength, Mihawk remains grounded. While he has become jaded regarding the abilities of other swordsmen, due to facing numerous weaker opponents, he is able to recognize talent. In fact, he has a desire to see Zoro surpass him after having witnessed Zoro's incredible will and determination after their battle. When he speaks to Zoro, he states he will wait for Zoro, no matter how long it takes and notes that he will continue to be the world's strongest swordsman, showing great confidence in his own skills and abilities. Despite having grown bored with being challenged by inferior foes, Mihawk showed excitement at being chased as a pirate once more due to the dissolution of the Seven Warlords system. However, he was eventually became annoyed by the Marines' nuisances, causing Mihawk to relocate and became Crocodile's business partner. Mihawk is selective and whimsical when it comes to fulfilling his duties as a Warlord of the Sea, as evidenced by his history of poor attendance at Warlord summons, as well as his decision to hunt and harass some pirates over others. Zeff speculated that the reason Mihawk attacked Don Krieg and his men might have simply been because they disturbed his nap. Mihawk admitted that the only reason he followed them all the way back to East Blue from the Grand Line was to kill time. Although Mihawk is normally passive when dealing with others, he can come off as rather blunt and cold at times. When Perona was crying over Moria's presumed death, Mihawk coldly told her to leave, saying her crying was annoying him. This was also shown again when he did not tell her that he found out about Moria being alive while stating he had no reason to do so. Although Mihawk spends most of his time alone, he is fine with making company with people, such as Shanks and Perona. He also appears to have a sense of hospitality, having (somewhat) tolerated Perona and Zoro's presence upon his return to Kuraigana Island right after the Whitebeard War; he even went as far as relay to Zoro the events that occurred concerning his captain, Luffy. In addition, he offered a boat to help the Straw Hat's swordsman leave the island. He also told Perona to be safe when she decided to leave the castle. In spite of his apathetic behavior, Mihawk is capable of showing care and compassion to others. When Perona learned that Moria was alive, she immediately went to reunite with him and Mihawk wished for her to be safe, causing Perona to tearfully thank him for letting her stay with him for the last two years. It is later shown that he personally let her go out of concern for her well-being due to him anticipating the Seven Warlords system being abolished so she would not be in harms way when the Marines would be sent after him. Mihawk also shows curiosity for the people he decides to attack. He attempted to strike Whitebeard just to see what the power distance between himself and Whitebeard was. He also attacked Luffy just to see if fate is on Luffy's side or not. As a result, Mihawk is very analytical about others' abilities, and can recognize strengths that others may not, such as when he understood that Luffy's natural charisma and quick amassing of comrades is his most dangerous attribute. Mihawk has an interest in agriculture, having started farming and tilling the war-torn land of Kuraigana Island, influencing even the Humandrills who were normally fearful of Mihawk to join him. While Mihawk is generally compose and level-headed, he is capable of becoming violent when angered. Alongside Crocodile, he brutally punished Buggy after the latter became publicly recognized as the president of Cross Guild and their \"boss\". He would usually punish Buggy when his overzealous followers further enforced this image, despite how Buggy never actually tried to do this. Like many other characters he has a unique laugh, unusually bearing two: \"Wahhahhahha/Kukukuku\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Strongest Swordsman in the World in both name and reality, Mihawk is one of the strongest pirates in the world. Even before the Great Age of Pirates he gained fame by defeating stronger and stronger foes until he had no worthy challengers left, and now he reigns at the top as the strongest swordmaster in the world. Due to his strength and swordsmanship, Mihawk was a rival to Shanks, a future Emperor and great swordsman in his own right. They competed fiercely in legendary duels on a daily basis until Shanks lost his left arm to the Lord of the Coast. His immense skill in battle allowed him to easily destroy Don Krieg's entire fleet of 50 ships and 5,000 men by himself, with only the main ship surviving because a bad storm pushed them away. He easily wiped out the Marines' fleet (who are invading Kuraigana Island in their persistently attempts to arrest him). This monstrous display of strength caused Don Krieg to assume that Mihawk had Devil Fruit powers. Additionally, he easily defeated Roronoa Zoro two years prior, using only his cross-shaped knife that he wears as a pendant around his neck. During the Summit War of Marineford he did not receive as much as a scratch, despite having fought against Vista and Crocodile. A true testament to Mihawk's extraordinary strength is that after the Seven Warlords of the Sea were abolished, his bounty was raised to 3,590,000,000, one of the highest bounties in the world that even surpasses two of the current Four Emperors: Monkey D. Luffy and Buggy. His fellow ex-warlord Crocodile stated that an organization headed by himself and Mihawk would not go unnoticed by the Marines, which was proven true when Buggy was named one of the Four Emperors solely due to the Marine Headquarters belief that Mihawk and Crocodile work under him when in reality, they are the founders of the organization. In the past, he was known as the \"Marine Hunter\". Aside from his combat prowess, Mihawk is also an excellent cook, having cooked meals for both himself and Perona for two years. In the anime, he is shown applying his swordsmanship to his cooking, using kitchen knives to cut vegetables with incredible speed and precision."},

Being a hammerhead shark Fish-Man, he has a head shaped like a hammer, with his eyes on the edges and the top of his head being darker than the rest of his body. When he is in a weakened state, the sides of his head tend to sag. His mouth is full of sharp, triangular teeth and has thick purple colored lips. His chest is wide and his arms very large, with extremely prominent, round forearms, his hands and thin legs being quite small in comparison. He has light blue skin, and long, wavy, light-pink hair reaching down to his shoulders and to the dorsal fin he has on top of his back; as a Fish-Man, he has gills on his large neck. On his left arm is tattooed his crew's Jolly Roger. He wears an unbuttoned, dark short-sleeved shirt with many dark yellow T-like motifs on it, simple light pants and sandals, he also has a sash tied around his waist, and a large buckled belt hanging on his chest from his left shoulder. He's usually seen carrying around a large hammer in his right hand and on the corresponding shoulder, with a very long and gnarled handle and a massive, dark head with the edges curved downwards, but he sometimes attaches it to the belt crossing his chest, carrying it on his back, with the head pointing upwards. As a teenager, his facial features were much softer, his eyes were rounder, his hair was shorter and curlier, and he wore an unbuttoned, light short-sleeved shirt with triangle patterns on it. After the negative effects of the Energy Steroids appeared, his body became old and weak.

His hatred is empty (due to being raised to hate humans but lacking actual experience) yet intense, and believed that even if they died in failure, they can leave a grudge against humanity for the next generation of Fish-Men to pick up, and stood by this belief by attacking any lower echelon who tried to run away from this ideology. Even though Dosun knows well that Hody will not hesitate to throw away his comrades, he continues to support his captain. He has a habit of saying \"Dosun\" often while talking. He also says different words depending on his energy level, \"dosun\" being him at his normal energy level. His exclamations at the end of his sentences altering from his lowest to highest \"power level\" are: When running low on power, his usual demeanor shifts into a more melancholic one that can be regressed by administering Energy Steroids to Dosun.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Dosun has command over lower-ranking members of the crew."},
{"name": "Donquixote Rosinante", "episode": "Episode 761", "chapter": "Chapter 686", "year": 2014, "note": "He was first mentioned by Trafalgar D. Water Law (as \"Cora-san\") in Chapter 729. His real name was revealed in Chapter 763.", "appearance": "Rosinante was a tall man (standing just below his brother at 293cm) as a 10-year old Trafalgar Law was not able to reach his waist; in adulthood, he was a comparable height to his older brother Doflamingo (who stands 305cm). He had golden-blonde hair, pale skin (tanner in the manga, much like his brother), and sharp, reddish-brown eyes. He was seen wearing a dark red hood from which two heart-like shapes hang from, a pair of beige jeans (white in the anime), a dark purple feather mantle much like his brother and a white shirt with pink hearts printed all over it. He also wears mismatched shoes. His hair was styled longer than his brother's, as it came close to his eyes. Rosinante had tattoos (or makeup) over his eyes and mouth. He was also seen wearing sunglasses, though he did throw away with these upon his six-months journey with Law. During his childhood, Rosinante had his hair in an unkempt fashion, covering his eyes. Prior to leaving Mary Geoise, he wore the typical garb of the Celestial Dragons, and had his hair in the same style as his older compatriots. After leaving, his hairstyle changed and he had wardrobe consisted of simple yet fine clothes with a frilled cravat that became very ragged due to the uneasy lifestyle he had to endure. Suffering from torture at the hands of the locals who hated the Celestial Dragons, as well as other battles, left scars and stitches all over his body. Upon joining the Marines, Rosinante wore the standard cadet uniform, minus the makeup/tattoos he has when working as a spy.", "personality": "When Trafalgar Law first met with Rosinante, Rosinante was noted for hating kids, especially when Baby 5 and Buffalo played practical jokes on him, such as making him slip upon passing through the doorway or giving him scalding tea that burned his tongue, resulting in his abusive behavior towards them. In fact, the first thing that Rosinante did to Law was to grab him and throw him out the window. This was actually part of an act, however, as it was his duty as a Marine to dissuade children from joining the crew, which he failed with Baby 5, Buffalo, Dellinger and Law. Despite his outward behavior of a violent man who dislikes children, he genuinely inherited his father's kindness (something Doflamingo himself admits) believing that his elder brother is a monster born evil and only acted cruel to children in the hopes of driving them away from following Doflamingo. He cared deeply for his birth family as he wept for his mother's death and cried when his brother was shot with an arrow. From his kindness, he did not possess any manners of a typical Celestial Dragon, and saw it his duty to stop his brother's madness, a sense of justice that led him to join the Marines as an undercover spy. Because of this, Rosinante was shown to be forgiving since he did not hold any grudge against Law for stabbing him in the back and even kept quiet about his transgression. When Law revealed his true name, he showed genuine concern and worry, even warning him about the danger that he was in. He was capable of compassion as he went as far as to go out of his way with both his brother and the Marines to take Law throughout the North Blue to find a doctor to cure the boy's disease and flew into violent rages whenever the doctors caved into prejudice due to their incorrect belief that Law was a walking contagious disease who should not have survived the extermination of Flevance. In spite of his extreme methods, due to his empathy and courage, he appears to follow his own ideals instead of adhering to the Marines' doctrine of Absolute Justice. He was believed to be incapable of speech due to a prior accident and, according to Diamante, was unintelligent and cannot concentrate. However, this was merely a faade and he was fully capable of speaking, as well as being perfectly intelligent, as seen by his playing on how the others perceive him. Upon hearing Law's full name, knowing the importance of the initial \"D.\", he was forced to break his silence, showing more perception than what his comrades believed. Although his mutism and dislike for children were mere acts to hide his true self, the one attribute that was genuine was his clumsiness, easily falling for Baby 5 and Buffalo's pranks and constantly tripping himself. He was also seen smoking, though due to his clumsiness, he accidentally set his own cowl aflame every time he tried to light a cigarette.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being born in the Donquixote Family, Rosinante was a World Noble, thus granting him political rights and privileges to do almost anything he pleased, as well as near limitless wealth and the ability to summon a Marine Admiral to strike down anyone who offended him. When his father forfeited the status of a World Noble for the family, he lost such privileges. Rosinante was undoubtedly a powerful fighter, being capable of taking Vergo's place as an executive officer in the Donquixote Pirates, where even Diamante acknowledged his fighting prowess. He was second-in-command of the many other officers and soldiers of the crew, alongside the other executive officers, and just under Doflamingo himself. As a Marine commander, he had command over all lower ranking soldiers, but he may have had more authority as he was a double agent who reported directly to an admiral. Rosinante was noted to be unintelligent and lacking in concentration as well as being very clumsy as he fell for both of Buffalo and Baby 5's pranks and setting his own cape on fire while trying to light a cigarette. However, Diamante stated he was nevertheless talented enough to become an officer, possibly due to his lineage. As with his mutism, it was an act that showed off his power of deception, as Rosinante was actually intelligent enough to even deceive his crew by hiding his true self and Devil Fruit powers in order to spy on them, as well as being aware that anyone with the D initial should not be anywhere near Doflamingo. However he was shown to be clumsy anyways, as it is his nature."},
{"name": "Donquixote Homing", "episode": "Episode 763", "chapter": "Chapter 699", "year": 2014, "note": "", "appearance": "Homing was a tall man, with dark blonde curly hair which reached to his shoulders, styled in the traditional way of the Celestial Dragons. He sported an impressive mustache, and, unlike his amoral brethren, possessed remarkably kind facial features and a rather thin face. He wore the typical garb of a World Noble during his tenure at Mary Geoise: a thick white suit with medal-like knobs on it, and a blue collar. After renouncing his status, Homing lowered his hair from the World Noble style, and switched to ordinary fine clothes, consisting a simple cyan dress shirt, dark pants with a light green cravat. His garments became increasingly tattered and dirty whilst living on the run in the North Blue.", "personality": "Unlike the typical World Nobles, Homing did not show any sign of arrogance or cruelty and viewed himself as a human being, like all normal people. He was humble as well as extremely kind and wished to live an ordinary life among commoners. Because of his great benevolence, he was seen as peculiar for a Celestial Dragon, and his compatriots even condemned him for being blasphemous for equaling himself with the rest of humanity; Homing took no offense in their insults and calmly brushed them off. However, after experiencing discrimination by angry victims of the World Nobles, he realized that he was nave as he had no prior knowledge of the hatred and resentment commoners had towards World Nobles. Despite his pampered past, he was at least appreciative of even the most minor opportunities for his family's safety, as when they found a relatively safe hideout in the junkyard, he felt relieved despite the insect infestations that Doflamingo alone complained about. Homing was willing to owe up to his own mistake by pleading the Celestial Dragons to rescue just his wife and sons, showing he was prepared to be left behind to reap what he sowed as long as his family remained safe. Notably, his speech pattern did not include \"eh\" at the end of his sentences, which is common among Celestial Dragons. He was extremely protective of his family and loved them very much. He showed signs of courage as he put himself in harm's way in order to protect his sons, and pleaded the angry mob to spare them. Before Doflamingo killed him, he apologized to his sons for failing them as a father.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, he could do as he pleased, without facing any legal consequences. He had tremendous political power and possessed the right to summon a Marine Admiral should he be attacked or think of someone as a threat. He was extremely wealthy and exerted huge political influence over the entire world, surpassing any royal members from the Levely. When he resigned from his position as a World Noble, he lost all of the above privileges and resources. Although Homing was given a manor and funds to start his new life, he lost it all overnight when a violent mob burned down his house and pursued his family in a bid for revenge against the Celestial Dragons' past actions. Coupled with his pampered past and lack of knowledge of prejudice that commoners have towards his heritage and the loss of the World Government's protection, Homing had a difficult time surviving in the North Blue, barely able to gather food to keep himself and sons alive, and watching helplessly as his wife died.

On her head, she wears a standard Impel Down hat. Two years later, she does not wear the white shirt under the jacket anymore and now bares more skin despite her cleavage being disguised by her tie.

He had a wide face with a bulbous nose that had snot hanging out from time to time, thick lips, and small slit-like eyes. Like all World Nobles, he wore a thick white protective suit adorned with medal-like knobs and an air bubble when out in public. When he arrived on Fish-Man Island, he was shown bloody and injured after his journey. During the Levely Arc, his appearance remained mostly the same with only some minor changes. He appeared slimmer and his hair appeared more angular. His face had facial hair, and his eyes appeared more blackish. He wore a simple, light purple collared shirt underneath his protective suit.", "personality": "Ten years ago, Mjosgard acted like most other World Nobles, considering himself to be a god who could do whatever he liked and who could get whatever he wanted from those of lesser status. He looked down on anyone who did not share his status, particularly non-humans like fish-men and merfolk. Although his family's fish-man slaves had been freed due to a legal agreement, Mjosgard wished to get them back due to the money he had spent on them and believed he was entitled to reclaim them. Notably, he was willing to personally go all the way to Fish-Man Island to seize them, though clearly did so believing he was invincible and not knowing the dangers of the deep sea. Even when the rest of his crew was killed and he was gravely injured, Mjosgard still expected that his slaves would return and the fish-men would give him the medical help he needed. When he finally realized that his former slaves could take revenge on him with no consequences, Mjosgard became extremely fearful and panicked, but remained unrepentant and antagonistic. Despite Otohime saving his life, Mjosgard was ungrateful and even attempted to shoot her at first; when his life was eventually saved by the fish-men, he promised to retaliate against his former slaves for their willingness to kill him. However, after Otohime accompanied him to Mary Geoise, her words eventually caused Mjosgard to have a change of heart and develop a debt of gratitude toward her for saving his life. He ceased owning slaves, and showed disgust at his past actions as well as attitudes and actions from other World Nobles that resembled the ones he used to have. When Otohime's family came up to Mary Geoise for the Levely, Mjosgard aligned with their interests over those of the World Nobles, to the point of even assaulting Saint Charlos to protect them and promising to claim responsibility for further retaliation, despite such defection ultimately resulting in a death sentence for him.

However, he pushed this authority to the limit when he crashed on Fish-Man Island alone, as he soon found himself to be helpless in a remote area where no one would say anything should he be killed and go missing. Mjosgard was the only person on his ship who managed to survive after being attacked by creatures on the Sea Floor, though was gravely wounded and would have died without receiving medical attention."},

Underneath his coat he sports an outfit reminiscent of those worn by naval officers in the 1600's, composed of a loose shirt with rope-like ornaments on it and suit pants. From Doberman's first introduction, he wore a red marine coat, that is changed to a white coat in the Summit War of Marineford in the anime.

He was perceptive enough to see through Spandam's lie about Robin, but Doberman did nothing to stop the attack on her. When questioning Saint Saturn about the possibility of sacrificing every soldier on Egghead for their war against Vegapunk and the Straw Hat Pirates, Doberman did not argue with Saturn's view on how humans are no different than insects that can repopulate even if many are killed.

His nose is slightly longer than normal, his face appears always unshaven, and there are straight purple tattoos coming from his hairline to the corners of his eyes. He has long and ash blonde hair, and constantly has a pallid look about him acting as though he is on the verge of death.

He would appear to wear a green turtleneck, and from under his coat sprouts what looks to be a brown robe, under which his hairy legs are visible. He has black, large-buckled shoes. On his back he carries a long, cylindrical bag, in which he keeps his scythe. His overall appearance resembles that of a stereotypical undertaker from Western fictions. Also, his pale skin, rather thin body, dark clothing, and use of a scythe is very similar to the typical Western image of a Grim Reaper; befitting of his epithet. As he is by his own admission very sick, this trait often shows on his expressions, as he commonly shows some level of pain and exhaustion, and sometimes stops during the middle of his sentences to cough. His chronic sickness is severe enough that he even has a gruesome tendency to bleed from his mouth. Despite these health problems, he also displays occasional smiles on matters he finds impressive.

However, once he became a pirate, he became crueler and started physically abusing Drake. Barrels was quite naive, setting up a deal to sell the Ope Ope no Mi to the Marines. He did, however, realize the fruit's potential, despite not wanting it for himself, though he did not know of the ability to grant immortality; Doflamingo regarded him as a fool for not knowing the true value of the fruit's powers. His greed for monetary value made him focus more on retrieving the fruit when it was stolen by Donquixote Rosinante than tending to his own injuries.", "abilities_and_powers": "Barrels' physical abilities are unknown, but he likely has proficient strength, as he had already made a name for himself, though he was no match for Doflamingo."},

He has striped, orange and red rectangular streaks that run down from his forehead, through his eyes, straight to his chin. In the digitally colored manga, he wears a pink shirt with purple pants and a crimson cape made of steel, while in the anime, Diamante dons a light-colored shirt with brighter red pants that match his cape. He is an extremely tall and thin man, noticeably larger than his 10-foot-tall captain, Doflamingo, and possesses a muscular upper body. He possesses a slight hunchback. His legs are especially long, protruding out right next to his face when he sits down. In the anime, he was given blue eyes. As a child, he wore an old and worn pirate hat which covered up his forehead, a large robe, a tattered tank top, and striped pants. Ten years ago, during the takeover of Dressrosa, the streaks on his face were not present.", "personality": "Every time someone says something flattering or good about Diamante, he denies it until the person flattering him stops. That is when he accepts the compliment and believes that the person praising him had offered his or her unbiased opinion about his talents. However, Diamante holds his status as the \"Hero of the Colosseum\" in very high regard, boasting about how he had surpassed Kyros in terms of skill and fame. He is also very cruel, as he spoke to Bellamy extremely harshly after he was beaten in the Colosseum. During the usurpation of the Riku Family, he was smiling during the burning down of the castle, indicating his joy during the event. This attitude extends to all recruits, even children, as he shows them little respect. Diamante also is rather insensitive and monstrous as he bluntly told Viola that he killed her sister and even laughed in her face about the act. This insensitivity is shown again when he informed Rebecca about her mother's death on top of mocking her father for his sorrow over her loss; he also called Rosinante lacking in intelligence and concentration right in his face. Despite this, he has no tolerance for anyone who mocks his crew, whom he sees as family members, being visibly infuriated and stunned when a foot soldier laughed at Pica's high pitch voice. Diamante does not seem to give in to popular opinion as he remained steadfast in declaring Rebecca the winner of block D when some other gladiators tried to attack her, showing at least fair sportsmanship. He also believes one must be honest with money, telling Rosinante to hand over the earnings from his job. However, he is willing to use underhanded tricks to gain the upper hand when he feels necessary, such as targeting Rebecca to create an opening while fighting Kyros or shooting Kyros in the leg while he is distracted by the rain of steel spiked balls. Like many One Piece characters, Diamante has a distinct laugh: \"Uhahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Diamante occupies the Diamond seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Diamante Army, with Lao G, Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger, all of whom specialized as a fighter brigade, as his subordinates. As the former proprietor of the Corrida Colosseum, he was in charge of all the goings-on in the building. He was also known as the \"Hero of the Colosseum\" on Dressrosa, for which Doflamingo held him in high regard. Doflamingo trusted Diamante enough to fight all of the block winners in the tournament alone, as the fighter brigade that he commanded had been sent away to complete various tasks. This implies that Doflamingo has enough confidence in Diamante's strength and abilities to at least compete against, if not defeat, Jesus Burgess, Bartolomeo, Rebecca, and Lucy by himself. Even as a 14-year-old, Diamante was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Trebol and Pica, all of whom were children. At 35 years old, Diamante, along with Trebol and Pica, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Alongside Trebol, Diamante defeated the dozens of ex-toys who tried to destroy the SMILE Factory without even receiving a single injury. Diamante is able to recognize Haki, as he noted the clash between Luffy's Haki and Don Chinjao's. Even at 14-year-old, he was already knowledgeable of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki have the qualities of a king."},

Real identity revealed in Chapter 973.", "appearance": "Denjiro is a very tall and muscular man, standing at 306cm. Before Oden's execution, he used to have rather big and round eyes as well as dark blue hair that was always kept in a long ponytail. He was always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses. When he was young, he wore a dark kimono with a four-leaf clover pattern; his face was also much rounder compared to its more pointed edges as an adult. As an adult, he wore a dark kimono with a small crescent moon on the left side of the chest. Because of his grudge toward Orochi, Denjiro's appearance changed sometime in the last 20 years. His eyes became slanted, he no longer wears sunglasses, he grew large sideburns, and his hair color lightened considerably. Eventually, he also started hiding his ponytail in a massive faux-pompadour. He wears a dark blue kimono with circles and target patterns on it, as well as a blue, high-collared cape. During the raid on Onigashima, he took off his faux-pompadour when revealing his identity. When preparing to infiltrate the castle, he wore the Beasts Pirates foot soldier uniform. When going out as Ushimitsu Kozo, Denjiro wore a yellow ninja outfit and put a yellow hokkamuri bandana over his head to hide his hair.", "personality": "When he was young, he took pride in his abilities to manipulate people and get what he wants. He was a fan of Kozuki Oden even before becoming his retainer, and held him in high regard for his bold actions. Oden's death was so traumatic that the very process of grieving caused Denjiro's facial structure to be altered. Denjiro's loyalty and strength of will cannot be understated. An unspecified time after Oden's execution, Denjiro (as Kyoshiro) became a subordinate to Kurozumi Orochi and spent the better part of the past 20 years earning his trust in order to find a chance to overthrow him and restore the Kozuki Family to power. Denjiro has shown great emotional control, despite his immense hatred for Orochi. He is able to perfectly restrain himself from expressing it and even bowed to the latter as well as protecting him from Zoro in order to not jeopardize the Kozuki revolution on the Fire Festival. After becoming Oden's retainer, he and the rest of the Scabbards worked to aid him in any way, until they were caught by Shimotsuki Yasuie during their attempt to steal his money. After being lectured by Yasuie, Denjiro and the rest of the Scabbards became noble and educated samurai. Denjiro, being the more knowledgeable one, was the one who would take some of the teaching onto himself. Denjiro served as the voice of reason for Oden, especially when it came to Kuri's finances. Denjiro attempted to advise Oden against making foolish decisions like giving Orochi money and leaving Wano, though Oden was rarely persuaded. Denjiro has also shown to be very kind, as after becoming Kyoshiro, he works hard in secret to give money to the citizens left impoverished by Orochi's tyranny, and he also took the responsibility of caring for Hiyori after she was separated from Kawamatsu. As Kyoshiro, Denjiro acts as a cheerful man who loves to drink. While intoxicated, he was unafraid of speaking bluntly about the shogun Orochi despite the potential danger, and he mocked the shogun for believing a prophecy from Kozuki Toki about his downfall. In this state, he is prone to experiencing rapid mood swings, ranging from laughter to intensity to falling asleep. He falls asleep in public frequently due to being up in the middle of the night as Ushimitsu Kozo. Due to his self-indulgence, Denjiro does not appear to bother with his obligations as the boss of his family. This was seen when he ordered his subordinate to contact Queen himself for an assassin to eliminate an individual who refused to comply with their extortion. However, he still cares about his family and will do what he needs to have them defended or avenged, regardless of how low-ranking they are. Ultimately, he is quite diligent when he feels like it, as he was able to raise Komurasaki to become Wano's top-ranking oiran. He even protected Orochi as the loyal guard dog from Roronoa Zoro's attack against the shogun. However, his efforts to help Orochi are all a ruse to help the Kozuki Family on the day of the final battle. As Denjiro trapped Sasaki, he showed a confident smile as their revolution proceed smoothly, finally elated that his patience in waiting for a chance to avenge Oden has paid off as he can finally exact revenge on Kaidou and Orochi.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro is a powerful samurai whom Kin'emon states (alongside Kawamatsu and Ashura Doji) is worth 100 men in battle. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure the former Emperor Kaidou in his full dragon form. As the boss of the Kyoshiro Family and (formerly) one of the highest-ranking subordinates of the Kurozumi Family, Denjiro is one of the wealthiest, most influential citizens of the Flower Capital, able to hire high-ranking geisha dancers to perform for him. He had enough wealth to sponsor and groom Hiyori into the highest-ranking oiran in Wano. As a yakuza boss, Denjiro commands strong henchmen who can extort businesses for money. Thanks to his connections with Wano's shogunate, Denjiro could strengthen his group further by requesting assistance from his allies, notably the Beasts Pirates, who appeared to treat him quite respectfully before his betrayal was revealed, as Page One referred to him as \"Boss Kyoshiro\" (, Kyshir Oyabun?)."},

He has facial hair that extends from the ends of his mouth to his chin, and his nose comprises of a narrow bridge, sloping outward, like the forehead, and ending in a large, wide, and rounded set of nostrils. His legs are thin and hairy. He is almost always smiling or laughing even after being wounded. He also has an X-shaped scar on his stomach and another scar on his left shoulder. His flintlock is always in his hand or tucked in his pants. In his attempt to impersonate Luffy, Black wears similar apparel. He also has an imitation scar beneath his left eye. However, the similarities end there. His scar has three stitches instead of two, his straw hat is frayed and unkempt with a striped band around its circumference, his shirt is open and too tight to close due to his obese figure, and he wears boots rather than sandals like the real Luffy. He also wears blue jeans like Luffy but without the fur lining and the real Luffy wears shorts while Black's jeans go to his shins. Black wore a typical pirate coat when addressing his recruits. All in all, he looks virtually nothing like the real Luffy.", "personality": "Black's personality is quite similar to that of the World Nobles, albeit somewhat less extreme, believing that impressive heritage and high status will grant him immunity and undeserved rights. The difference is that the World Nobles, and other Royalty, are mostly correct, unfortunately, and do receive such privileges, while Black's ruse is only impressive to other criminals. He is extremely ruthless and egotistical, using the real Luffy's reputation to act with impunity. With Luffy's exceedingly high bounty and known infamy, Black believes he can get away with virtually anything. He treats his reputation as an entitlement, expecting others to accommodate him simply because he is a famous pirate. He seems to have enough common sense to realize that his reputation alone will not protect him from everyone, though he still attempts to use it as leverage in a pinch. Black angers easily when things do not go as planned, or at any perceived slight by anyone he meets. He treats something as simple as being knocked down as an offense to kill someone over. This seems to extend from his stolen reputation, as he believes the act gives him the right to behave as such. Because of his ego, Black, in attempting to exact revenge, seems to be blinded to the dangers his opponents represent. Despite the real Nami, Usopp, and Luffy all dispatching him and his immediate crew with casual ease, his anger drives him to get revenge at any cost, even gathering his entire collection of recruits just to deal with three people. He also attempted to talk down Sentomaru using his reputation, even though Sentomaru clearly did not buy his act. Unlike the real Luffy, who places little importance to a person's background, Black takes every opportunity to brag about his heritage and accomplishments, which he uses to justify his actions; in fact, he uses it as his primary weapon to intimidate his opponents in order to defend himself. He has no qualm with hurting innocent people, apologizing sarcastically after accidentally shooting bystanders he mistook for his enemies. He places no importance on the well-being of his crew, viewing them as a means to an end. By comparison, Fake Sogeking shows more care of his crew mates than him. He also appears to be a coward, using the fake Nami as a sacrificial lamb to escape Usopp's man-eating plant. Black's arrogance seems to cloud his better judgment. Having met the real Nami, Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper, he failed to recognize any of them. Black had to be told of Chopper's identity by the fake Sanji and Zoro. It was also apparent that Black did not take into the account the consequences of impersonating a notorious pirate such as Luffy, apparently forgetting the fact that he was currently wanted by the World Government, not to mention the fact that the real Luffy made scores of enemies on the wrong side of the law in achieving his level of notoriety and that some of them may even exploit the Fake Straw Hats recruitment scheme in order to get close enough to target the impersonators, which led to the fake's capture and Sentomaru even stated that Black and his fellow impostors were idiots. This mindset, coupled with his ego, ultimately led to Black's downfall when his empty threats against Sentomaru backfired. Like many characters in the world of One Piece, he also have an unique Laughter Style, which is \"Dohahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Black appears to survive solely on his ability to manipulate others, having little apparent combat skills to speak of. His skill in deception was quite impressive as every person who did not know Luffy previously actually believed that Black was the Straw Hat captain, although Sentomaru noted that anyone who believed the impostor's lie was considered stupid. Unable to defend himself against more powerful opponents, Black instead relies on his stolen reputation as Straw Hat Luffy to intimidate foes into not fighting back, though he is smart enough to realize that not all of his opponents would be deceived by this. The one thing that can be said in Black's favor is that he is fairly durable, managing to walk away from attacks by Usopp's Pop Greens and Nami's thunderbolt, albeit while somewhat injured. However, Sentomaru knocked him out in a single strike from the broad side of his axe. He has also been shown to have a weak will, as Luffy was easily able to knock him out using Haki."},

He has a round face with dark colored lips and concentric circles around his eyes, a black goatee on his chin, and teeth quite spaced out one from another, similarly to Bluejam's. His attire also includes a light blue scarf held up by a clasp made up of three linked jewels, an indument that looks like a brown vest, and a pirate captain's hat matching his robe, with a little skull represented on it. He carries around a saber.", "personality": "Not much is known about Delacuaji's personality other than that he is very loyal to Whitebeard since he was willing to risk his own life trying to save Ace from execution instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his power.

{"name": "Daz Bonez", "episode": "Episode 160", "chapter": "Chapter 103", "year": 2000, "note": "His real name was revealed by Smoker in Chapter 217.", "appearance": "Daz is a tanned man with long, thin limbs and fingers. He is tall and very muscular and his head is shaven. His most striking feature is probably the black unibrow, right over his round eyes. He has big lips and the archaic Japanese symbol of the number \"1\" (, ichi?) tattooed on his torso. In Arabasta, he sported an oriental-looking attire consisting of a sleeveless dark coat with golden edges and white motifs on the front, over very loose beige pants held up by a white sash around the waist, with some light brown fur sprouting from it. His pants were tucked inside some bandages wrapped around his calves and in part around his shoes. In Impel Down, like most prisoners, he wore striped prisoner clothing. He gained a scar to the right of his right eye, likely a result of something that occurred while or after he was taken to Impel Down. (Due to the fact that he lacked such a scar or any sort of facial injury during the Miss Goldenweek mini arc, it is impossible for him to have obtained the scar during his fight with Zoro.) During his break-out of his cell, he was bare-chested, with his shirt tied around his waist. After the Summit War of Marineford, he sports a dark suit over a plain open shirt, with a tie kept loose around his neck.", "personality": "Daz is very stern, calm, focused, disciplined, self-assured and confident. Due to his Devil Fruit abilities, he has come to think of himself as unbeatable. He is laconic and serious at all times and does not tolerate weakness or frivolity. Daz also has the belief that having friendships makes one weak. Surprisingly, he does not seem to care for grudges either; he assisted Luffy in the escape from Impel Down due to Crocodile's orders, barely noting the fact that Zoro and Luffy are companions. Mr. 1 was notorious within West Blue for his previous profession as an assassin (under his real name \"Daz Bonez\"), implying he was (and still is) highly skilled at stealth and killing efficiently. He also demonstrated to be merciless to those that dare challenge him to combat, and is not concerned with the swordsmen code of conduct as he attacked Zoro while in a vulnerable and defenseless position. However, he demonstrates high loyalty to those that treat him with respect (Crocodile), and is not a petty man clouded by past bias or judgements. In battle, he is utterly merciless and bloodthirsty, such as hitting Roronoa Zoro while the pirate was wounded and unable to defend himself after licking his enemy's blood off his own hands. He was also indifferent to the fate of a fellow prisoner that he knocked into a boiling pot; at the same time, he licked the blood trickling down from his own head injury. Nevertheless, Daz does have some sense of honor, as he accepted his defeat at Zoro's hands. While Daz is generally a cold-hearted person, as a child, he secretly had a dream of becoming a superhero. When Miss Goldenweek materialized this dream, his face showed great discomfort, but was actually quite thrilled in secret.", "abilities_and_powers": "Formerly a bounty hunter from the West Blue known as \"The Killer\", Daz Bonez is a proficient hand to hand martial artist and highly dangerous combatant feared for his talents in assassinating criminals. Even Smoker, a formidably powerful Marine in his own right, acknowledged Bonez as a powerful opponent and was surprised Zoro managed to defeat him. Befitting his profession, he has considerable knowledge in assassination, as seen when he started targeting Nami before Zoro in Alubarna, saying that the first rule of assassination is \"pick off the weakest target first\". His power was great enough to put him in the Level 4 of Impel Down, where he defeated a fellow prisoner easily. He is strong enough to defeat many Whitebeard Pirates members and their allies from the New World. His strength has earned Crocodile's respect, something that most Baroque Works members and even Crocodile's right-hand woman, Nico Robin, did not get. Crocodile went out of his way to free Daz from his cell to assist him in the upcoming war. His skills are good enough to be recognized by the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, who does not bother to remember the names of every weakling that he crushes. He is strong enough to be unafraid of the New World as he has no problem going there. It can also be surmised that after two years, Daz grew much stronger, as he not only survived his time in the New World with Crocodile, but also helped destroy the Marine ships sent after Buggy after the dissolution of the Warlords system."},
{"name": "Dellinger", "episode": "Episode 702", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Dellinger is a very short, slim teenager with shaggy shoulder-length blonde hair and a generally effeminate appearance. His clothing is simple, consisting of light-colored hoop earrings (white in the anime) on his ears, a white baseball cap with horns coming out of it on his head and a mark on the center of his hat shaped like a dark fighting fish (colored blue in the anime), a long sleeved shirt with a giraffe-like design on it, blue shorts, and dark purple stilettos.Though his eyes are innocent-looking outside of combat, if he becomes bloodthirsty, his irises grow wide and red, similar to those of the fighting fish and the way Arlong's eyes change when angered, as well as those of the Lord of the Coast. Stemming from his fish-man heritage, he has a fighting fish dorsal fin located on his back and horns coming out of his head. This fin appears to be retractable as Dellinger was able to keep it hidden until he attacked Blue Gilly. He also has sharp, retractable teeth that he can grow out by forcing his human teeth out of their gums. As a newborn baby, without even being a year old, Dellinger had an even smaller version of his hat with tiny horns poking through and a small fish drawn on it. He was wearing normal baby clothes, with his already visible fish-man dorsal fin popping through it. At six years old, he wore a backpack and the giraffe-like patterns were only on the lower half of his shirt. The mark on his hat was shaped like an ordinary dark fish (blue in the anime).", "personality": "Dellinger has a flamboyant and flashy attitude that matches his eccentric fashion sense. He seems confident in his abilities, as well as a bit arrogant, as he tells Bellamy that he is going to kill him right after demeaning him. He's also a bit too carefree, as he apparently has a habit of blabbing things he knows to others, such as secret information like Doflamingo's order for him to dispose of Bellamy. Because of his confidence, Dellinger holds his own heritage of fighting fish fish-man with pride. In battle, he is rather sadistic and bloodthirsty, such as when he's fighting against Suleiman. Dellinger also believes that strong people don't require honor, as he mocks Ideo for having such ideals. That said, he's prone to cockiness and as such, doesn't take a lot of situations seriously. This leads to him to be quickly defeated by Cavendish in his Hakuba form when Gladius tries to warn him to stay back but he did not listen. He is also shown to be easily annoyed when someone else hinders him from killing his intended target. He becomes very angry at Bartolomeo for protecting Bellamy and swears retribution for his actions. Stating that this is his \"family's business\", he also shows strong bonding to his own crew, which he considers his family. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, he is heard speaking with a double voice, using a pitched and effeminate tone when talking casually, and a deep and masculine tone when fighting or threatening rivals. In the anime, when Dellinger was cut, he was shown visibly worried at seeing his own blood due to a sleepwalking Cavendish slashing him, possibly indicating he never been wounded before or meeting someone who outmatched his speed. Concludes non-canon section.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Dellinger held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. Due to his fish-man heritage, Dellinger is powerful enough to frequently participate in the Corrida Colosseum's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high. It is said that when Dellinger and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory. Arguably the greatest testament to his considerable battle prowess is Dellinger's membership in Doflamingo's crew for the entire 16 years of his life, starting from his infancy, an impressive feat considering that, according to Diamante, of the 100 people that tried to join the crew, only the absolute strongest remained after just two days. At six years old, he assisted in the takeover of Dressrosa as the youngest member of the crew. As a testament to his strength, Doflamingo trusts him enough to task him with killing Bellamy, an older pirate with a bounty of 195,000,000. This faith turned out to be valid, as Dellinger easily managed to defeat Bellamy, nearly killing him (if not for Bartolomeo's interference). He later easily defeated Suleiman, Blue Gilly, Dagama, and Ideo. Despite being a powerful member of the group, he was swiftly defeated by Cavendish in his Hakuba form in one strike."},
{"name": "Donquixote Doflamingo", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Doflamingo is a very tall (standing at 10' and as a comparison taller than Kuzan as shown in their confrontation), light blond-haired, very lean and muscular man with tan skin. He generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored, with his light pink feather coat most distinctly of all. Doflamingo sports a pair of curved, thin white sunglasses, which appear to serve as his eyesight with red or purple lenses. He also walks with an odd, bow-legged waddle (though he does not always walk like this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. He has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. He also wears black dress shoes that are somewhat pointed. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction, with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange-tinted glasses, while in the anime (pre-timeskip) he has purple-tinted ones. He is also seen often, if not always, smiling. Two years after the war, Doflamingo's outfit is somewhat less elaborate, wearing a plain, open shirt that has small, dark Jolly Rogers as cufflinks, a different belt, and pink striped pants. However, he still wears his trademark sunglasses which have changed from purple to red lenses and dress shoes. Post-Timeskip, he drapes his feathered coat on his shoulders instead of leaving his arms in the sleeves, similar to many high-ranking Marines and pirates alike. He also now wears a golden hoop earring on each ear. After his defeat by Luffy, Doflamingo wore a horizontal striped prisoner outfit. Even as a child, Doflamingo spent most of the time wearing sunglasses, though he had not yet acquired his trademark ones. Before leaving Mary Geoise, Doflamingo wore the typical garb of the Celestial Dragons, and his hair fashioned the same style. After the family left Mary Geoise, his hair was changed to a simply neat and tidy in a bowl cut and his wardrobe consisted of simple fine clothes: a low-neck button-up shirt with black striped and a frilled cravat. However, due to the harsh life on the run from angry citizens, Doflamingo's appearance started to turn more disheveled; in a depiction, his shirt and hair grew messier and unkempt, going barefoot, sitting on a tattered chair near palm trees, smoking a cigarette. At age 10, after gaining loyalty from his four closest childhood friends, he changed out of his tattered noble clothes for a simpler, yet cleaner, black shirt, and white shorts. From this point onward, Doflamingo began to look more threatening. He eventually took on the appearance of a mob boss, wearing a black coat like a cloak over a pale lavender shirt with an unbuttoned collar, bole-colored shorts. His hair took on a spiky appearance, and he replaced his ordinary sunglasses with the trademark pair with spiral-shaped red lenses that he has now. At age 17, his hair was longer than it is currently, he had two earrings on his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead. In addition, he also wore sunglasses similar to the ones he wears today, but they had a different temple design and his signature feathered mantle. At age 25, when Law first came to him requesting membership in the crew, Doflamingo seemed to have done away with the goggles, but otherwise seemed the same in appearance; he wore a black dress shirt with a red tie and white pants with a bright red design, with his signature mantle over it, At age 28, during his trip to Minion Island he briefly wore a blood-red double-breasted suit with yellow-gold buttons, with matching blood-red dress pants and shoes, a pair of (dark green in the anime, black in the manga) gloves and changed his sunglasses to the ones he wears currently. By the time he was 31, he had his hair cut down to the current length. Currently, after his defeat at Dressrosa, Doflamingo now has Seastone shackles on his arms, legs, and entire chest, while chained to the floor of Tsuru's ship, he is also wearing a standard Impel Down prison uniform, with a few white bandages on his forehead as well. He was also given a new set of sunglasses.", "personality": "Doflamingo is an incredibly arrogant, prideful, and carefree person. He seems to have a penchant for dramatic phrasing, as well as a habit of exaggerated posing when giving declarations. He fears very few people, as he openly taunted Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Warlord meetings and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. He does, however, dislike it when people take rumors seriously and speak them as facts, and does not cave into such prejudice from such false rumors, as seen when he grew irritated when Giolla stated the incorrect belief that Amber Lead Syndrome was contagious. He also has a habit of sitting in strange positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, on barrels, and even on a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone and on top of a wall. He is also completely calm and cool-headed in most situations; even when Baby 5 attacked him with what would be lethal blows, he simply dodged away casually while continuing to have his conversation over the phone. Doflamingo seems to live by a \"might is right\" philosophy, believing that the strong are the ones who make the rules and will be the only ones capable of living in the \"New Age\". Due to his belief in this \"New Age\", Doflamingo seems to lose interest in other things easily, as seen with his leadership of the Bellamy Pirates and the ownership of the Human Auctioning House. He also threatened to quit the Seven Warlords of the Sea if the orders given by the World Government are not satisfactory to his liking or if they annoy him, and that he never really cared about the World Government from the beginning. Though a firm believer of the \"New Age\" philosophy, Doflamingo, unlike his former subordinate Bellamy, himself seems to have an open opinion on dreams, though dreams themselves do not seem to interest him at all; despite his belief, he does not seem to oppose becoming the Pirate King. Like many other characters, he has a unique laugh, being \"Fuffuffuffu\" (?), or in characterized English, \"Heh heh heh heh\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Donquixote Pirates and a former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Donquixote Doflamingo is an extremely powerful pirate who had complete authority over the two thousand soldiers and eleven officers of his pirate crew. He was active in the realm of underworld brokering (including slavery, drugs, production and distribution of weapons of mass destruction, and Devil Fruit trafficking) in the New World, and the most resourceful and influential broker there was. In addition, he was the King of Dressrosa, which gave him dominion over an entire kingdom. However, upon his defeat at the hands of Luffy, Doflamingo was stripped of his title of king. Being able to deceive the entire world that he resigned from the Seven Warlords is considered to be an impossible feat by anyone less than a World Noble, as Doflamingo was indeed one, which gave him the privilege to do as he pleased on a global scale, without any fear of repercussions. Upon his father dragging him away from such a luxurious life he lost all the privileges; however, he has managed to obtain knowledge of the Mary Geoise's national treasure, which, when used in combination with the powers of the Ope Ope no Mi, could shake the foundations of the world, a fact he used to blackmail the Celestial Dragons when they failed to kill him, allowing him to regain (to a limited extent) the privileges of a Celestial Dragon and mobilize CP0 to falsify his resignation from the Seven Warlords. Ten years before the current storyline, Doflamingo managed to steal monetary tributes meant for the World Nobles, blackmailing the World Government and allowing him to earn the status of Warlord. By that time, his reputation was also enough to intimidate King Riku Doldo III to try and gather a massive sum of 10,000,000,000 from Dressrosa's citizens to avoid fighting against him. During the Summit War of Marineford, he faced off against former Warlord Crocodile and later emerged unharmed. Later he fought and defeated another of his colleagues, Gecko Moria (though he was aided by a small group of Pacifistas and Moria had yet to recover from his injuries from the war). Whoever ordered him to take out Moria apparently had enough confidence in his strength to have him kill a fellow Warlord and was highly disappointed when he allowed Moria to escape before the final blow could be dealt. Doflamingo claimed that the one who gave him the order to kill Moria was of higher rank than the then fleet admiral, Sengoku, those being either the Five Elders or Commander-in-Chief Kong, or somebody else of high rank within the World Government. Doflamingo is such a formidable threat that Law suggested that if the pirate resigns from his position, Marine Headquarters will send their top fighters, the admirals, to capture him. This was also shown when Kuzan told Smoker to immediately warn Sakazuki about Doflamingo, and that the fleet admiral should dispatch the admirals. His superiority over the lower-ranked Marines was enforced when Doflamingo toyed around with Vice Admirals Mozambia and Stainless, and then later defeated Vice Admiral Smoker, both occasions with tremendous ease, showing that he has the ability to take down at least a Vice Admiral at Smoker's level (who's formidable as a Logia-type Devil Fruit user). He is so strong that Law, a Super Rookie, and a Warlord, chose not to fight until he encountered Doflamingo to save energy and have a higher chance against him. Despite this, he defeated Law, without major inconvenience on two occasions, and both times he was about to kill him if it were not for the help he received. He similarly showed no fear of Admiral Fujitora. Aside from his tremendous combat skills, Doflamingo had an international level of influence, being a Warlord and an infamous pirate. Several countries at war relied upon him and his operations to provide weapons for them. His defeat and capture made them unable to support themselves any longer and forced many of them to surrender. He was also known as Joker, the most powerful broker in the Underworld, and had Kaidou of the Beasts, who was considered to be one of the Four Emperors, as his main business partner. He had the Bellamy Pirates under his authority, as well as powerful subordinates such as Vice Admiral Vergo and Monet, as well as formerly Trafalgar Law, who was a fellow Warlord. He had Vergo installed into the Marines as a spy, thus having a trusted and convenient Marine under his command. Doflamingo was also associated with the former World Government scientist, Caesar Clown, but did not trust him and placed Monet as a deep cover agent to monitor his actions. He declared Caesar Clown to be his direct subordinate, which in turn instantly cleared all of Caesar's crimes and could not be arrested by the government any longer. Upon being defeated this is rendered null and void, as such he is a criminal once again. In addition, Doflamingo was the owner of the once-most popular Human Auctioning House at the Sabaody Archipelago but gave it to Disco when he lost interest in slave trading in favor of the Summit War of Marineford, the SMILE business, and the New Age. His abandonment of the auction hall made it succumb to ruination, further demonstrating the power of his influence (and the consequences for the lack of it). He seemed to have a lot of connections as he was able to acquire the reborn Mera Mera no Mi."},

In her appearance in Luffy's flashback, she was seen smoking a cigarette. She wears a white collar shirt, a pink beaded necklace, chequered trousers held up with a large belt, and heeled boots. After ten years, her outfit changed to a black shirt with a light-colored open coat over it, and two years after that, the colors became inverted; otherwise, her appearance has not changed over the years. In her youth, Dadan was once a very beautiful woman, being much thinner with a curvier body outline. She wore a one piece dress.", "personality": "As far as personality goes, Dadan's is that of a somewhat stereotypical petty criminal, a bit cowardly in regards to Garp blackmailing her, her freedom, and Garp himself. She also does not seem to be too patient as she was beginning to get sick and tired of raising Ace because of his antics and became even more aggravated when she was left with Luffy. Though despite this petty side, the other mountain bandits hold great respect for her, and will follow her orders even into a deadly fight. The methods that she supposedly used to \"discipline\" both Luffy and Ace were rather questionable (though Luffy seemed to be able to easily put up with them on account that the treatment he received under his own grandfather, Garp, was hardly any better) since they included providing them with limited food, making them clean the house, hunting for them, and even resort to criminal activities (i.e. plundering people). However, judging from Luffy and Ace's regard for her whenever she was mentioned, she may have been a better person than anyone might have thought of her. She has also been known to show brief signs of bravery, as seen when she and her family of bandits came to rescue Ace and Luffy from Bluejam; only to scamper immediately afterwards upon securing the two boys' safety. Although she says that she hates brats, she appears to really care for Luffy and Ace like they were her own children but seems too embarrassed to admit it. In the anime, this is later proven true when Ace, Sabo, and Luffy decided to leave the bandits cottage and make a hideout of their own. At first she tried to show that she did not care, but once it started raining heavily, she ordered the bandits to go look for them. When they finally did, she went and visited them secretly during the night, only to be hit out of the boy's hideout from a trap that they had built. Upon learning of Ace's death, Dadan was extremely distressed, mostly at the thought of how much Luffy would be hurting over the loss of Ace. She was upset enough to even attack and beat up Garp, someone whom she was usually deathly afraid of, further demonstrating her hidden concern towards the boys. Dadan even shed tears at Sabo's presumed fate, as she previously learned of his survival.", "abilities_and_powers": "Dadan is the mountain bandit boss of the Dadan Family, and has command over the gang. Their reputation is quite notorious, as according to Garp, they committed more crimes than the stars. She, along with Ace, were powerful enough to defeat the infamous pirate Bluejam.

{"name": "Crocodile", "episode": "Episode 126", "chapter": "Chapter 76", "year": 2000, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nefertari Vivi in Chapter 113.", "appearance": "Crocodile is a tall man with a wide chest, broad shoulders, muscular arms and legs, and a thick neck. He has pale skin and nape-length black hair, which is kept neatly slicked back, though strands tend to fall in front of his face during battles. Crocodile has various battle wounds, most notably a long-stitched scar at the bridge of his nose that stretches across his face and a large hook made from a tough gold alloy in place of his left hand. His eyes are deep-set and heavy-lidded, and his thin eyebrows are characteristically drawn upward in the middle. This gives his usual facial expression a feeling of condescension and distrust. Crocodile speaks with a deep, relaxed voice, and he is usually seen smoking a thick cigar produced by his company. In the anime, his skinis somewhat of a grayish color. His theme of dress is meant to convey the image of an Italian mafia boss. In his original appearance, Crocodile wore a bright orange, black-striped button up vest over a long-sleeve peach shirt (white in the manga and One Piece: Pirate Warriors series), along with a blue scarf, dark brown suit pants, and polished black shoes with gold buckles. He also wore a long, thick, dark pelted fur coat (fully dark green in the manga and One Piece: Pirate Warriors, dark gray with a regular gray fur trim in the anime, and dark green with a light green trim in Movie 8) over his shoulders. After he was incarcerated at Impel Down, he wore a striped prisoner uniform, like most other prisoners, but was somehow permitted to keep his gold hook. After joining Luffy and Jinbe on their mission to save Ace, he obtained a full change of clothes from the supplies of Newkama Land and thereafter wore a black shirt, a green scarf, dark grey slacks, and a black overcoat with brown tan (light color in the anime) fur trim. After the Summit War of Marineford, he is seen in attire that greatly resembles the one from the Arabasta Kingdom, consisting of a vest over a plain shirt, a scarf around his neck, suit pants, elegant shoes, and a fur coat draped around his shoulders. After the timeskip, his apparel continues to resemble his outfit during the Arabasta Arc, but with a vest that features diagonal crossing stripes rather than squares. In all his appearances, he wears a single gold hoop earring in his right ear, and he usually has several golden rings with different colored gemstones on every finger except the ring finger, for reasons unknown (in the anime version of the Arabasta Arc, it was his middle finger that was bare. This has since been corrected in recent arcs). In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Crocodile is shown having a similar hairstyle as his adult self, but is missing his trademark scar and hook. He is shown wearing simple clothing with a large pistol slung on his belt.", "personality": "Crocodile is a seasoned, cunning and business-savvy pirate who is self-assured and confident in himself and his own abilities, as evidenced by his former title as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea that he had held on for years. He enjoys toying with weaker opponents, often grinning and laughing smugly during battle. However, due to his overconfidence, he seriously underestimated Luffy's willpower, and this eventually led to his defeat. Crocodile is first introduced as an intimidating and sophisticated mastermind, although to the people of the Arabasta Kingdom, he was viewed as a savior figure who protected the country from pirate attacks, as part of his duty as a Warlord of the Sea. In spite of his status as a national hero, Crocodile could not care less for the local population and their adoration for him, looking down on them as fools and only acting against threats in order to keep up appearances. In his plot to take over Arabasta, Crocodile callously and inhumanly orchestrated the destruction of several communities, with the intent of inciting strife that would eventually lead into a bloody civil war. Crocodile's actions were enough to disgust even former bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro, who described the Warlord as the worst of scoundrels. Crocodile's willingness to kill shows his pitiless nature, and he does not think twice about sentencing another person to death. He is also very quick to get angry if someone insults or ridicules him in any way; Crocodile told Nico Robin that he had killed everyone who had ever insulted him. This irritability is first seen when Sanji sasses him over the Den Den Mushi. It is more clearly shown during his first fight with Luffy: when the Straw Hat captain called him stupid, he bit his cigar clean in half and then threatened to kill Robin for laughing. By his own admission, Crocodile is not always rational. Despite his low tolerance for receiving insults, Crocodile has the habit of taunting others, frequently using the word \"worthless\" to refer to the desperate struggles of his enemies, although he seems to have changed this habit slightly since fighting Luffy. Crocodile is known to belittle his foes, generally implying that they are far inferior to him, whether he is fighting a rookie or a fellow Warlord (namely Donquixote Doflamingo, who had a former bounty almost 300,000,000 higher than his own). Crocodile's capacity for looking down on others is so high that he even told Dracule Mihawk, the World's Strongest Swordsman, to \"watch himself\". In battle, Crocodile shows a complete lack of fear and doubt, although this trait was broken down a bit during his third battle with Luffy. He usually appears to be very composed and fearless, even when facing fearsome opponents like Whitebeard, Dracule Mihawk, or Akainu. If Crocodile is extremely angry or annoyed with his victim, he will rarely kill them outright, instead leaving them to suffer as they slowly die. This proved to be a bad habit, which ultimately led to his defeat. In his first and second fights with Luffy, instead of killing him straight away, Crocodile left Luffy to suffer. Because of this carelessness, Luffy was able to come back in two different occasions and finally defeat him. This, along with sheer luck, are the only reasons Luffy lived through any of his fights with Crocodile. This also allowed Mr. 3 to survive Crocodile's attempt to feed him to the Bananawani, which proved to be instrumental to the survival of the Straw Hats. Crocodile has displayed an extremely cynical and patronizing attitude, showing complete disregard to the romantic pirate lifestyle and stating that all the values that the status of Pirate King had once symbolized were now worthless to him. Crocodile valued military power above popularity, renown, and treasure, believing that only ignorant fools declare their grandiose dreams. He referred to having trust and faith in others as an idiotic thing to do several times during the Arabasta Arc, claiming to have done away with countless people and going as far as to deride those who fight for someone else, making their defeats all the harsher. Crocodile has been shown to almost completely lack any code of honor. Extremely pragmatic to the point of treachery, Crocodile once offered a sadistic choice to Vivi, only to later reveal that it would not matter in the end, making any effort from her part meaningless. One of the few vestiges of honor he ever displayed was in his third battle with Luffy, during which he stated that Luffy deserved an honorable death from his venomous hook. Due to the situation at the time of battle, this could be seen as more an ironic act of cruelty than honor, but he did seem to regard the use of his rarely seen poison hook as a tribute to Luffy's tenacity. As another example of his distorted sense of honor, after Whitebeard had been injured by Squard, Crocodile refused to fight him in that weakened state. In fact, he became furious at Whitebeard's loss of strength out of pride, having been defeated by the Emperor in the past. Crocodile shows no emotional concern for most of his subordinates, and they don't have any to him. He is fully willing to sacrifice them to achieve his ambitions; a prime example is Operation Utopia, wherein every Baroque Works member in Alubarna, including most of the Officer Agents, would have been killed by the resulting cannon blast. He also has no qualms about killing them if they fail or betray him, having little tolerance for anything that may threaten the outcome of his plans. He showed no true attachment, affection, or trust toward these people and viewed them only as pawns. Despite all this, Crocodile is very loyal to Daz Bones: He seems to have a very good relationship with Mr. 1, having gone out of his way to rescue his former subordinate from his cell. Daz in return is very loyal to his boss, even getting angry if someone disrespects him After being defeated by Luffy and being stripped of his Warlord title, Crocodile apparently lost interest in the outside world. He refused to escape with the rest of his subordinates during the breakout detailed in the eighth Cover Story. Upon his capture, he disregarded the notion of escaping simply because he did not feel like it, perhaps assuming that escape would come easily to him if he changed his mind. Similarly, he smiled at the news that he would be sent to Impel Down and seemed apathetic during his imprisonment. Crocodile was the only Impel Down inmate who appeared to be enjoying himself; he was initially seen smiling and mocking his fellow prisoners. He claimed that he was only in Impel Down because he chose to stay, an assertion well in line with his overly condescending demeanor. His only apparent motivation to leave Impel Down was the chance to enact revenge against Whitebeard. Following the war, Crocodile seemed eager to journey to the New World with Mr. 1, having reignited his ambitious side once more. Crocodile seems to have mellowed out since his defeat in Arabasta, at least to some degree. He seems more willing to assist others, having offered to aid Luffy escape from Impel Down, and he nonchalantly accepted help from others as well. Certain revelations imply that he may not be as heartless as he lets on. During the war, he went beyond his personal agenda several times to save his allies' lives. He saved Ace's life and protected Mr. 1 and Luffy from Mihawk. He even prevented Akainu from cornering Luffy and Jinbe as they desperately tried to escape the scene of the battle. Nevertheless, he claimed that he only saved them because if he had not, the Marines would feel victorious, and that prospect irritated him. Crocodile has a distinct laugh that starts with \"Ku\" (i.e., Kuhahahaha!). In the anime, he tends to laugh at a much slower pace than one might expect, his \"hahaha\"s lapsing into \"ah-ah-ah\"s on occasion.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile is powerful enough to be recognized by the World Government. He was the Warlord with the second lowest bounty at the time 81,000,000, with Hancock having the lowest, although he held the title for so long that such a low bounty would now be outdated. Currently, he now has the fifth highest after the former Warlords, Blackbeard, Mihawk, Buggy, and Law, with a bounty of 1,965,000,000, Indeed, when Crocodile was stripped of his Warlord status and transferred to Impel Down, he was placed in Level 6, where the world's absolute worst criminals are kept. He defeated Luffy no less than twice before his eventual defeat. In fact, if not for his good luck and the help he received from several people, Luffy would have been killed in all three battles: he was impaled (and then rescued by Nico Robin), dehydrated (and then revived by his own Water Water Pistol), and poisoned (and then received the antidote from Robin). Moreover, if Luffy's blood had not served as a way to nullify Crocodile's Logia-Type defense, and if Robin had not supplied Luffy with the antidote to his hook's poison, the third battle would have effectively favored Crocodile as well. Later on, during the Summit War of Marineford, Crocodile was uninjured after confronting fellow Warlords Donquixote Doflamingo and Dracule Mihawk in quick succession, despite the fact that both opponents possess and have complete mastery of their Haki. Against the latter, he did not seem to be concerned at all about facing the strongest swordsman in the world, even going so far as to threaten him. Crocodile was even able to battle Admiral Akainu and survive completely unharmed afterward. After time-skip, Crocodile became more powerful than before. He easily defeated Vice Admiral Stainless and his fleet. His bounty of 1,965,000,000 has made him an extremely dangerous threat to the World Government's operations. This is furthered by the fact that he and Mihawk merely becoming subordinates to Buggy was enough to get him named as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government."},

Although Chinjao's expression is usually calm and serene looking, his expression changes to a fiercer look when enraged, with his facial hair waving upwards. In his youth, he wore a long, buttoned, blue-colored shirt, with light green circle patterns and a yellow, grey captain's coat draped on his shoulders. He had a long-pointed head, which gave him his epithet \"the Drill\". However, after a punch from Garp, his head was forced into its dented appearance. A glancing punch from Luffy later reverted it to normal. Not long after that though, a kick from his grandson, Sai, bent it. While under the effects of the Hobi Hobi no Mi, he appears as a Santa Claus-like doll. At Sai's wedding, he wore a bowtie and a mantle.", "personality": "He seems to be a quiet and calm person, as he did not react to Luffy defeating Spartan. He is quite perceptive as, unlike many people in the Colosseum, he saw through Luffy's disguise. His immense presence, imposing nature led to him having a serious, solemn demeanor. Chinjao carries a great deal of pride for his own abnormal head; which gave Chinjao the capacity to hold an enormous grudge against Garp for shrinking it. His grudge would even carry over to a child whom he claims would inherit their parent's sin, as he wanted Luffy to pay for his grandfather Garp's actions, and even commented on how he would have killed Dragon if he knew that he was Garp's son sooner. Despite his grudge, he is at least able to maintain civility by addressing his enemies with an honorific suffix. However, this is short-lived as he can enter into a violent rage at the prospect of Garp's bloodline being near him. Despite being incredibly vengeful, he is also immensely grateful to those who do him favors. After Luffy returned Chinjao's pointed head, Chinjao's grudge has ceased to exist. He also holds younger pirates like the Worst Generation in low regard, going so far as to praise the Marines for cleansing the demonic blood of Roger two years ago, thereby pulling the sprout that showed the most potential as a pirate. He always seems confident in his own fighting capabilities. During his fight with Garp, he believed that the Marine would end up losing his fist. At the Corrida Colosseum, he did not think highly of Luffy during their battle despite the pirate's reputation and believed that he will succeed in killing the Straw Hat captain. Prior to losing to Garp, Chinjao seems to be somewhat merciful, having ordered his men to simply round up the thieves attempting to steal his treasure and then sendthem drifting across the sea. He still addresses his enemies with an honorific suffix and politeness in civil conversations, such as knocking out some of the competitors in Block C while letting them off by knocking them out with Haoshoku Haki. However, Chinjao happens to be rather brutal in combat, as he knocked away numerous competitors to get to Luffy in Block C. Unlike Sai, he would even allow Baby 5 to commit suicide given a misunderstanding between her and Sai, going as far as to try preventing him from saving her life and attempting to take both their lives after Sai continued to do so. Chinjao is proud of the Happo Navy and his family. He would expand his military power through an arranged marriage between Sai and the daughter of the leader of the Niho Navy. When Sai was preventing Baby 5 from committing suicide, Chinjao declared him to be a disgrace to the navy and the family. However, after Sai bent his pointed head, Chinjao cried in joy over his grandson's power instead of getting angry, showing affection and gratitude of his family's strength, as he would call off the arranged wedding and declared that he would give his title of \"Don\" to Sai. Like most notable characters, he has a unique laugh: \"Hiyahoho\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Chinjao Family, he has complete control over them. He was a known enemy of the famous Marine, Vice Admiral Garp, enforcing a good deal of power.Chinjao and Garp fought for many times, and Garp destroyed eight mountains as a training to prepare for their last battle. Since he is a former commander of the Happo Navy he has access to their techniques as he used them quite well in battle. In his golden age, when he was still a pirate, he was considered a rival to both Garp and Gol D. Roger, and had a bounty of 542,000,000. However, the bystanders watching him attack Luffy implied that he may have weakened with age. A battle with Garp caused his head to be flattened and diminished his power while he was still in his prime.Sometime, following his fight with Monkey D. Luffy,he reveals to Sai that his illness has worsened since their clash, which, along with his old age, has further depleted his strength. His losses to his grandchild and then to Lao G are actually attributions precisely to this factor; also, the latter had to use all his power and a surprise attack."},

Smoothie wears a pink striped leotard, a large yellow scarf that flows nearly to the ground, sleeves around her elbows, a huge floppy cap resembling an oversized beret (although she was not seen wearing it during the Tea Party) and a pair of long dark boots that reach up to her knees with decorative adornments at the top. She also has a tattoo of a rose on her upper right leg.", "personality": "Smoothie approaches things with a carefree attitude. She will agree to help crewmates if she has the time but tends not to display any investment into the tasks she does take on; however she will be remorseful for failing said tasks. Though she may be nonchalant most of the time, Smoothie can get very serious should circumstances require it and will waste no time in creating tactics to smooth out a given problem in the most efficient way possible. She is also perceptive on other people's nature and will make decisions based on how someone might react, as shown when she neglected to tell Big Mom about the prisoner revolt in Whole Cake Chateau due to knowing that her mother would fly into a rage nobody would want to deal with. She also quickly realized that Katakuri was disturbed and asked him if something was wrong after he foresaw Pudding crying. Smoothie has a very cruel side too her as well, as she likes to squeeze the life out of subordinates, even when being pleaded with to stop, and enjoys drinking the liquid produced while callously dropping dried-out bodies aside, treating them as sources of liquid rather than people. This is further shown when she hung a woman from a rope, along with a giraffe and a volcanic rock, using them as drink dispensers. She can get carried away while she is in her cruel side like how she got carried away by deciding torture Nami by squeezing her instead of killing her instantly. During special occasions, such as Big Mom's Tea Party, Smoothie can be friendly and polite, greeting the guests and warmly offering them drinks. In spite of her cruelty and carefreeness, Smoothie is very loyal to her family and crew, as she will execute any assignment given to her by those she respects. When it comes to situations that will surely make her mother angry, Smoothie will take it upon herself to save her from unnecessary trouble, as she did not report the breakout at the Prisoner Library. She also cares deeply for her family and crew, as she was shocked when Capone Bege was about to assassinate her mother, and warned her siblings and crewmates on Big Mom going on another rampage in Sweet City. Like Oven, Galette, and Brle, Smoothie detests traitors, as she got furious at Bege and his crew in their attempt to assassinate their mother and at Jinbe for joining and aiding the Straw Hats. Smoothie appears to be confident in her abilities. Similar to Katakuri, she does not appear to brag about her power and deals with problems efficiently. When Perospero contacted her to bring down the Thousand Sunny, Smoothie commented that he should have let her handle the situation from the start. Smoothie can be a bit reckless, seen when she made herself bigger in an attempt to sink the Thousand Sunny at the risk of sinking her own ship. She also has the utmost pride in her crew, as Smoothie was in disbelief that she and her crew were taken lightly after Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom failed, and when Bege's fortress was under attack by Big Mom, she expressed her intention to torture the Fire Tank and Straw Hat Pirates to set up an example for others if they underestimate them. Smoothie usually keeps her composure during battle and other frantic situations, as she only commented that Reiju was \"trouble\" after being poisoned by her. The only time Smoothie tends to lose her composure completely is when her mother goes on a rampage due to her cravings. During such instances, Smoothie has been seen in panic and screaming to her siblings to run while fleeing from her rampaging mother. Although she is a hybrid, Smoothie shares her paternal heritage by exposing and decorating her long legs.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates, Smoothie's authority within the crew is second only to her mother. As the Minister of Juice, Smoothie has authority over 100% Island in Totto Land. Vito noted Smoothie as a \"monster\" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing her to Katakuri. Her bounty of 932,000,000 suggests that the World Government considers her extremely dangerous. Given her title of Sweet Commander, it is likely that she is stronger than her very powerful brothers, Compote, Daifuku, Oven and Perospero. Together with Daifuku and Galette, she managed to subdue Sanji, Reiju and Luffy, although the latter was heavily weakened. Smoothie has a considerable amount of leadership and tactical skill, and can quickly come up with plans for her forces to trap and kill enemies.

She was first identified in Chapter 850.", "appearance": "Pudding is a teenage girl with round, reddish brown eyes (blue in the manga), and prominent lips. She is somewhat short, shown to be about one head shorter than Sanji (who is 180cm) when standing directly in front of him. She has light brown hair styled with pigtails in the back and side-swept bangs in the front. Her most defining feature is her third eye on her forehead, which is usually covered by her bangs. As a child, she had shorter hair tied in two pigtails. She wore a pink dress with a floral pattern, and later a red dress with a white-colored collar. In her first appearance in the Fish-Man Island Arc, her hair was styled slightly differently, being tied into a single ponytail on the top of her head and lacking her bangs, exposing her third eye. She wore a revealing pink blouse along with an orange corset, puffy red pants, red suspenders, and matching red shoes. In the photograph of her that Vito showed Sanji, she wore a blue outfit decorated with a floral pattern. When she first encountered the Sanji Retrieval Team at Cacao Island, she wore a frilly light-purple top with a pink stripe down the middle and puffy, light-purple pants. While she was at a bridal store in Sweet City, she wore a light-purple dress. At the Whole Cake Chateau prior to the wedding, she wore a light pink dress. During her \"wedding\" with Sanji, she wore a white bridal outfit with roses on both side on her hair. When she returned to Cacao Island to make the substitute wedding cake, Pudding changed her outfit into a chef's attire, which includes a chef's hat and an apron. Her chef outfit has a knee-length dark-colored skirt. When she parted ways with Sanji, Pudding wears a cloak.", "personality": "As a child, Pudding was abused and ridiculed because of her third eye. Under her mother's rule, she decided to cover her eye with her hair, which escalated to hiding more aspects of herself. Linlin's tyranny made Pudding feel like her mother's puppet, and she was unable to go against her orders, despite internally resenting her. In truth, Pudding is very timid, sensitive, and frightful, which she flawlessly hid with her superior acting skills. She actually possesses a strong inferiority complex concerning her third eye, planted by the mocking of children during her youth, and her own mother's tactless and mean comments. When Sanji became the first person in her life to say anything nice about her third eye, Pudding became emotional and even broke down in genuine tears, showing her true personality and preventing her from following her mother's instructions to kill Sanji. Although she attempted to kill Sanji (even after he saved her life) while admitting about her true nature and that she had deceived him, Sanji surmised that Pudding was deceiving herself as much as she was deceiving others. Having been touched by Sanji's kindness, Pudding developed a genuine romantic fixation on Sanji and an 'erratic personality disorder' centered around him, which can best be described as an extreme form of tsundere. Her moods rapidly switches between her dishonest 'tsun' half, in which she openly and seemingly happily scorns Sanji (and those associated with him), to her loving 'dere' half, where she would blush and act affectionately towards him. This dichotomy of emotions confuses even Pudding, as she wonders aloud why she behaves the way she does after her emotions take hold. Whenever she watches Sanji do something incredible, Pudding blushes heavily, even getting a nosebleed herself as seen when witnessing Sanji kick her brother Oven aside. She even has developed a genuine care for Sanji's interests, as she showed concern for Luffy after hearing about his fight with Charlotte Katakuri and for Chiffon when Oven threatened her life. Thanks to her acting skills, Pudding created a mask of a vicious and cruel person. As part of her mother's plan to assassinate the entire Vinsmoke Family, Pudding deceived Sanji into believing she loved him, taking advantage of his attraction towards her as well as his own vulnerable state of mind (caused by her family taking his friends and Zeff hostage). She also successfully deceived the Straw Hats who had come to retrieve Sanji, convincing them that she would release Sanji from their arranged marriage and help them reunite with him. As part of her act, she also mocks and insults her enemies, and will simply ignore efforts to insult her back. She showed a great degree of sadism as she enjoys torturing her opponents with the horrific truth as soon as she believes she can get away with it, which is made easier by her ability to manipulate memories. Believing people would hate her, Pudding often reveals her third eye when playing this character. Pudding seems to find her image and popularity as a \"good girl\" important and wishes to keep it up. She is willing to put a lot of effort into erasing and manipulating everyone's memories to keep them from finding out her evil personality, although she wishes there was a simpler way with less work. As part of her act, Pudding appears to be a misandrist and shallow girl, with a low opinion on men, believing they are easily duped by her crocodile tears, and held Sanji's love-filled confession in low regard, treating it as though it was a joke. Pudding also vocally expressed her disgust at Sanji's swollen face, degrading it as ugly and unlovable, and considers him unworthy of being a proper prince. She also does not like perverted behavior being directed towards her by people she does not care for, as she becomes filled with rage and disgust when Sanji has a nosebleed after she pretends to entice him, to the point where she is overwhelmed with a stronger urge to kill him. Away from her family, Pudding shows another personality, more closely resembling to her true self. When Pudding was first introduced, she appeared to be a benevolent and kind girl to others. She seemed to have truly loved Sanji and wanted to marry him, but understood his wishes of wanting to return to his crew, and was even willing to help his crewmates rescue him. Upon realizing he was already imprisoned by Big Mom's shackles and having no one left to rely on, she swore that she would not let the marriage be hell for him. This kind personality is often used to lure her victims into trusting her.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Pudding holds authority over lower-ranking members of her crew. As a half-member of the Three-Eye Tribe, Pudding may also be capable of awakening a true power that will allow her to decipher the text on the poneglyphs, although she has stated that she may be unable to due to her mixed heritage. She also intends to use her third eye as a means of a psychological attack, shocking Sanji with it during the wedding in order to create an opening for her to shoot him. Pudding possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and stay conscious from her loud screams."},

She has round eyes and an extremely large mouth that displays a set of very sharp teeth. On her head she wears a hat that appears to be the skin of a panda's head; the hat is stitched on the sides, and the stitches start right where her mouth ends. She wears a low-cut dark dress with small frills on the top, and over it she wears an open coat which is lined with fur, especially around the neck.", "personality": "Not much is known about Poire's personality, but she appears to be a civil woman, as she was shown chatting with someone at the tea party. She is loyal to her family and crew as she attacked the members of the Straw Hat-Fire Tank alliance after they crashed the wedding and attempted to assassinate her mother.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Poire has authority over lower-ranking members of her crew. Her combat powers and abilities are unknown, but she is presumably strong as she is an officer of an Emperor-led crew. Poire possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream."},
{"name": "Charlotte Perospero", "episode": "Episode 834", "chapter": "Chapter 795", "year": 2016, "note": "", "appearance": "Perospero is a very tall and slim man with brown eyes, a pointed nose, pink lips, and a very long, thick tongue. He is often seen smiling, but on rare occasions, such as when his mother threatened him, his smile changes into that of a horrified expression. He wears a long, yellow coat with a tall lighter colored collar and the top buttons resembling large, purple and pink striped pieces of wrapped candy. The bottom of his coat has a checkered design and large beads along the hem. There is a dark-colored beaded bracelet on each wrist and his long sharp fingernails are painted dark. His large, orange and red striped hat has rainbow-colored lollipops along its rim and a large, pale pink plume. Something large and navy blue with baby blue polka-dots comes out from under his hat and curves upward on either side. His shoes have a long tip spiraling inward. He carries large magenta and pink candy cane with a curled top which he often licks. After he was engulfed in a massive explosion caused by Pedro, Perospero lost his right arm which he replaced with a candy prosthesis via his Devil Fruit ability. This artificial arm was shredded by Nekomamushi during their last fight. Five years ago, as he was escorting Pedro out of Totto Land, Perospero wore a coat similar to his current one but of a darker color. As a child, Perospero wore a pair of orange and white striped pants, brown and white dress shoes, a much smaller hat lacking the lollipops, and a coat similar to his current one, but with a less elaborate bottom.", "personality": "Perospero is extremely sadistic, taking great joy in tormenting others, such as when he threatened Caesar Clown with the prospect of being turned into candy and licked to death while also squeezing his heart for fun, as well as when he mocked a sobbing Vinsmoke Judge once the latter realized Big Mom's treachery. Perospero is not without fear, as he became terrified when his own mother threatened to kill him if she discovered that he was lying about the Straw Hats stealing a spare cake that was made for the wedding ceremony. He also became greatly shocked when Pedro was about to blow both of them up with explosions. He can also be vindictive, as after his right arm was severed by an explosion caused by Pedro, Perospero swore to make the Sanji Retrieval Team suffer for Pedro's actions. Perospero is also unreasonable and selfish, as he blamed Sanji for defiantly not dying during the Tea Party for the sake of his mother's plan to steal Germa cloning technology, believing that innocent people should willingly be killed for his mother's tyrannical ambition.However, he also possesses quite a strong will and tenacity, as he was not dissuaded from pursuing the Straw Hats even after losing said arm. Like his mother, he has a strong fondness for sweets, demonstrated when he gluttonously licked a giant candy cane while introducing Caesar to his new laboratory. When he lost his arm, his main complaint about it was that his candy arm replacement would melt whenever he drank tea. He refers to people he is fond of as candy, calling them \"sweet\" as he referred to Nami as a sweet \"candy girl\". Despite his cruel tendencies, Perospero has also demonstrated a strong care for the well being of Totto Land and its citizens, as he was willing to risk his own life and lie to his crazed mother to keep her from rampaging within Sweet City. He is shown to have some leniency, as he offered Brook and Chopper a chance to escape after assuming that Big Mom dealt a fatal blow to their friends. He appears to be very affectionate and kind towards children as shown when he told a group of little children to be nice with each other as he offered them lollipops and allowed them to eat the candy escalator he made with his power. He seems to care for his siblings since he angrily demanded Luffy to unhand his sister Brle after she pleaded with Perospero to save her. Similar to most of his siblings, he is very arrogant and prone to underestimating foes as seen when he considered it impossible for the Straw Hats to escape from Big Mom alive as he taunted Brook and Chopper about their friends' presumed demise while watching them fight his soldiers. This was shown again when the rest of the team arrived. He was surprised at their survival before regaining his composure and boasted that Luffy could not destroy his candy iron maiden but was surprised when he did. He was like this when the Straw Hats were presumed to have been washed away by Big Mom's tidal wave only be to be shocked and baffled when he learned of their continued survival. Perospero's arrogance makes him have a need to constantly toy with his enemies and either taunt or gloat to them whenever he has the upper hand. As rather than just finish his enemies off when given the chance, Perospero sadistically toys with them as long as possible. This attitude has cost him on several occasions, such as the Vinsmokes being able to escape from his trap despite having them dead to rights, losing his right arm in Pedro's sacrifice despite having pinned him down and being defeated by Nekomamushi on Onigashima because of his need to gloat to his enemies. He is also very proud of his bounty, as he was shown boasting about it to Pedro after he subdued him. He also believes that the birth order in the family matters as he claimed that he should be captain of the Big Mom Pirates if anything happens to Big Mom. He has a tendency to use the verbal tic, \"Perorin\" (?, \"Lickity\" in the English Dub), at the beginning or end of his sentences. Like many other characters, he has a unique laugh: \"Kukukuku\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer in the Big Mom Pirates, Perospero holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members, and as the Minister of Candy, he has authority over Candy Island in Totto Land. Besides, as befits his eldest son status, he was seen to be in charge of several of his other siblings in carrying out the massacre of the Vinsmoke Family at the tea party,and directing them as they chase their enemies down. Even Smoothie, a Sweet Commander, decided to follow his orders. As proof of his power and dangerousness, it is of what his bounty of 700,000,000 surpasses that of Snack, despite the fact that the latter was one of the Sweet Commander in the past. Vito noted Perospero as one of the \"monsters\" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing him to his younger Sweet Commander siblings Katakuri and Smoothie. Caesar Clown, an infamous criminal with a bounty of 300,000,000, was terrified of Perospero when the latter threatened him. Perospero easily subdued Brook and Chopper, and then defeated Pedro, one of the most powerful minks, without any problem. During the Raid on Onigashima, he also defeated Wanda and Carrot simultaneously despite having transformed into sulongs for part of the match, and faced off against Nekomamushi himself, where the mink was overwhelmed by the pirate, until he regained his sulong form, and went on to defeat him with one decisive blow. It is seen that his will is strong enough to withstand Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki."},

He wears a high-collared orange cape which ties in the front in a yellow bow, short gloves, a thick belt with a circular buckle, capris, striped socks, and loafers. When his Devil Fruit is activated, his cloak was shown to darken in color. As a child, Oven wore a long sleeve shirt with ties in front. He wore orange and yellow pants.", "personality": "Oven has utmost loyalty to his mother and will follow her orders to the letter. This includes being complicit to exiling former husbands, as seen when he attacked Pound when he intruded on Cacao Island to see Chiffon. When ordering the people on Cacao Island to break all of their mirrors, he threatened to kill them and their families if they did not comply. Oven cares greatly for the safety of his siblings, as he became enraged upon seeing Pekoms holding his \"beloved\" little sister Brle at gunpoint, and due to his great respect for Katakuri, he attacked Luffy in a fit of rage after finding out he had beaten him. He also agreed not to intrude on Pudding's cake baking operation. However, he also takes betrayals extremely seriously, as he did not hesitate to attack Chiffon for being complicit in Bege's attempt to assassinate Big Mom, even though she was his sister and she assisted Pudding in making the substitute wedding cake, and Praline for siding with the Sun Pirates. When fighting his enemies, he sometimes is able to recognize the struggle they are going through and the ramifications of their fighting, but that does not make him merciful, as shown when he fought Pedro. He is also not above using underhanded tactics as he plotted to take Chiffon hostage to make Bege surrender. He is extremely prideful, as when the Nostra Castello was heading towards him, he refused to move out of its path, allowing Bege's ship to run him over. His pride extends to his crew's strength and reputation as an Emperor's pirate crew as he was shocked that Germa 66 was ambushing them at Cacao Island after Charlotte Nusstorte's army invaded their kingdom where he was certain they would be massacred and destroyed. He absolutely denied the possibility of Katakuri losing against Luffy, believing that the latter's chance of victory was zero and was completely shocked when he learned of Katakuri's defeat. Oven is also a hypocrite, as while he refuses to acknowledge Pound as his stepfather, he expressed rage at the latter for trying to attack him while referring himself as his stepson. His anger can also get the best of him. While attempting to sink the Nostra Castello, he risked ruining the substitute wedding cake needed to stop Big Mom's craving rampage. Oven can have quite a temper as he got extremely furious when Bege shot him in the face.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Minister of Browned Food, Oven has authority over Yakigashi Island in Totto Land.

With a bounty of 300,000,000, the World Government considers him to be a threat. Oven is capable of conceiving practical and well-thought-out plans for dealing with enemies. He ordered all the mirrors on Cacao Island to be broken, with the exception of a large one in the town square to limit Luffy's possible escape routes from the Mirro-World. He is also capable of coordinating a large number of his siblings and soldiers in order to set up traps and defensive formations.

Furthermore, this would display his brutal nature in that he had no qualms about killing others for the benefit of his family.

He also has a tendency to treat serious matters with a nonchalant attitude, so long as they do not affect him, as shown when he prepared to torture Nami with only a plain expression on his face.

Prior to meeting the Straw Hats, she had proposed 4443 times. Upon seeing Luffy, she makes it 4444 times. She then later proposed to Sanji, Chopper, Usopp, Zoro (twice), Franky (twice), and Brook. Luckily, she takes rejection well and is not distraught by it. She is also rather honorable. This is seen when she refused to abandon the Straw Hats, her crew's shining star of hope, even when she was being vaporized by the rising sun. Lola also initially said that she would never dream of taking treasure from her saviors until Nami revealed her friendship with the former's shadow zombie. According to Chiffon, Lola has a happy-go-lucky personality, making her very optimistic and naive due to her carefree nature, as she believed that despite her mother'simmense ruthlessness, Big Mom would still care for her.

{"name": "Charlotte Katakuri", "episode": "Episode 860", "chapter": "Chapter 825", "year": 2017, "note": "He was first mentioned by a Whole Cake Island resident in Chapter 843.", "appearance": "Katakuri is an extremely tall, large, and muscular man standing in at 509 cm. He stands at nearly three times Luffy's height and is slightly taller than his younger triplet brothers, Daifuku and Oven, who are incredibly tall themselves. He has short spiky crimson hair and two symmetric scars on both sides of his face. He has long legs, with his thighs being equally as long as his lower limbs. His mouth, which is usually covered up, contains sharp pelican eel-like teeth and is capable of expanding to an enormous size. Katakuri has sharp, intense, crimson eyes, highly arched eyebrows, and prominent lower eyelashes under each eye. He wears a massive light ragged scarf that covers his mouth and reaches his shoulders. He also wears a torn leather vest with \"CHARLOTTE\" on the back that exposes most of his torso, dark gloves and pants, a belt with a skull-shaped buckle, and spiked boots with spurs. His torso is very defined, having prominent abdominal muscles covered in pink tattoos, and he wears spiked bracelets on his arms as well as knee pads with a single spike on them. In the anime, Katakuri wore a dark cloak when arriving at the Whole Cake Chateau. As a child, Katakuri wore a dark torn jacket and dark pants without a scarf. It was only after Brle was attacked that he decided to cover his mouth.", "personality": "Katakuri is a calm, serious, and diligent man who devotes himself to protecting his family and crew and achieving their objectives. He frequently uses his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki to quickly address any problems or threats that he foresees, and whenever possible he will work to change the future, he foresees and stop the problem before it happens. Katakuri makes sure to waste no time in accomplishing his tasks; when his brother Perospero was gloating to the captured Vinsmoke Family, Katakuri told him to hurry and shoot them immediately. Katakuri is quite brutal when attacking opponents to ensure they are quickly neutralized and will use his weapons to inflict gruesome wounds with impunity. Katakuri's haste to resolve problems can sometimes work against him, though, as his attempts to change the future may not achieve his intended result. Katakuri is almost always calm even in the most perilous of situations, as it is necessary for his mind to be clear in order to utilize Kenbunshoku Haki. If he is taken by surprise or foresees something terrible in the future, he is shown to lose color on his face and he may sometimes shout, but he does not panic. When it comes to judging his opponent's power, Katakuri is neither boastful nor meek and so will bluntly point out when an opponent is clearly inferior to him (to the point of encouraging them to flee while they can) but will also notice if they pose a serious threat or are improving their abilities, and he will even commend enemies who demonstrate impressive strength or tactical maneuvers. He takes care to never underestimate his opponents' abilities, and rather than entertain the activation of a new ability he is quite pragmatic and will prevent his opponent from activating it. Even when his crewmates were confident that the Straw Hat Pirates would be killed by Big Mom before they could escape to their ship the Thousand Sunny, Katakuri took forces to lie in wait on the Sunny \"just in case.\" Katakuri also takes note of opponents' potential, and will specifically target enemies whom he feels could pose a more serious threat in the future. Katakuri takes his status as the strongest subordinate of Big Mom quite seriously and makes the effort to maintain the appearance of perfection that his siblings and crewmates consider him to have, particularly by never lying on his back in public. However, he has been shown to silence siblings who are heaping excessive amounts of praise onto him. Although he works to eliminate enemies efficiently, Katakuri is ultimately an honorable fighter who prefers to fight fairly and heavily respects opponents who can match him. Thus, he absolutely despises receiving assistance in a fight, and will even yell at a sibling if they interfere in his battles. If he finds that he inflicted a wound on someone due to outside assistance, he will give his own body the same wound to compensate for it and even the playing field. When he was bested in combat for the first time by Luffy, Katakuri retained his respect for the pirate and was enthused, rather than angry, when Luffy confirmed his intention of coming back and defeating Big Mom in the future. Later, he even smiled after learning that Luffy had escaped from Totto Land. To cope with the stresses of his position, Katakuri takes regular light meal breaks, known as merienda, where he feasts on his favorite food of doughnuts and drinks tea. Katakuri has loved doughnuts since he was a child, to the point of eating them so often that he caused his mouth to artificially expand. Eating doughnuts puts Katakuri in a state of bliss, and during his merienda he has been shown voicing his love for them out loud in very intimate language. Katakuri keeps his merienda extremely private as he lies on his back and relaxes during it, which is a stark contrast to his siblings' view of him as someone who never lies down. The merienda is a very important part of Katakuri's routine and so he will become quite annoyed if something keeps him from doing it at the allotted time. When his fight with Luffy made his merienda late, Katakuri became willing to forgo his usual diligence and attempted to quickly finish off his opponent by burying him in mochi, not taking the time to make sure Luffy had died. Another reason that Katakuri shrouds his merienda in utmost secrecy is that he is extremely sensitive about his pelican eel-like mouth, which he was bullied for as a child. Initially, he had no issue with just attacking his bullies in response, but after the bullies took revenge by attacking his younger sister Brle, Katakuri took to wearing a mouth covering at all times in public. When his cooks accidentally saw his mouth in the Mirro-World, Katakuri completely lost his mind and used brutal force against them with murderous intent; he was so angry that he even misheard one of their pleas as a comment about his mouth. However, Katakuri went on to take off his mouth covering during his fight with Luffy after acknowledging the latter as an equal, believing that Luffy was no more deserving of his sister Flampe's scorn than he was. Katakuri has a habit of telling people around him what he foresees them saying or doing next. This habit ended up backfiring on him during his fight with Luffy, as his vocal premonition of Luffy's Gear 4 deactivating gave Luffy the chance to fly away from him before it did.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders, Katakuri's authority in the Big Mom Pirates is second only to his mother's, and as Totto Land's Minister of Flour, he holds authority over Komugi Island. In battle, Katakuri is a very powerful combatant. His tremendous bounty of 1,057,000,000 shows how dangerous he is considered by the World Government, and Capone Bege of the infamous Worst Generation has likewise declared him a monstrous threat. According to his crewmates, Katakuri is the strongest of the Three Sweet Commanders, the strongest of Big Mom's children overall, and thus the most capable member of their crew aside from Big Mom herself; Daifuku even stated that, were Big Mom to die, Katakuri's skills would make him the worthiest of succeeding her as captain of the Big Mom Pirates. Katakuri has been called a \"monster\" for his strength ever since he was a child, and until his first loss against Luffy, he was said to have never lost a single battle throughout his lifehis long and perfect record of victory described by Oven as \"legendary\". Also, Katakuri is strong-willed, as he withstood a blast of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki long enough to continue on his feet to help his siblings."},

She also loves him to the point that she would compete with her siblings to get her brothers favoritism. However, this obsession is entirely superficial, since Flampe displayed immense shock when Katakuri injured himself, and repeatedly mocked the appearance of her brother's hidden mouth. Flampe thus is very petty and immature, even threatening to gossip about Katakuri's display of weakness to everyone, all while disowning him as a relative of hers.

He is not above striking and verbally abusing people whom he thinks are failing or getting in the way, even if they are his own family, as he hit his sister Pudding after she failed to kill Sanji and called her useless. Daifuku seems to believe that strength matters in the crew as he stated that Katakuri should be leader if Big Mom meets her unforeseen demise. Daifuku is confident in his Devil Fruit. When Pudding failed to kill Sanji, he took it upon himself to eliminate him with his genie. This was shown again when he decided to take it upon himself to sink the Thousand Sunny. However, he happens to underestimate his opponents, as he did not count on Carrot's Sulong form.

{"name": "Charlotte Cracker", "episode": "Episode 835", "chapter": "Chapter 796", "year": 2016, "note": "Real appearance revealed in Chapter 838.", "appearance": "Cracker is a muscular man of notable height, at 307cm. He has mostly short, purple hair with a long, baguette-like bun tied at the back of his head and a pair of thin, pointed strands on either side that appear to spark like firecrackers. A very large scar covers his right eye and he has small wrinkles around both eyes. Cracker is shirtless and wears a kilt with decorative biscuits adorning it as well as shin length brown boots on his lower half. On his right shoulder, he wears a large brightly colored pauldron that has a pink polka dot cape attached to it. Cracker usually operates within a suit of biscuit armor, created by his Devil Fruit, and will only show himself if the armor is damaged or destroyed. This is to such an extent that his wanted poster mistakenly features the face of his armor, rather than his true appearance. This armor takes the form of a large, brutish-looking warrior (standing about four times bigger than Luffy) with a prominent nose, a large pointed beard, disproportionately thin limbs, and a prominent scar on the right side of its face (which it shares with the real Cracker). It is also fitted with a vest made of crackers, a Spartan-style warrior's helmet, and horns worn on the side of its head.", "personality": "Cracker is very loyal to his family and crew, demonstrated by his anger upon discovering that his former stepfather was revealing their secrets to Monkey D. Luffy and Nami. He firmly believes that one's heritage defines their character, incorrectly assuming that Sanji would happily consent to his arranged wedding out of loyalty to his family and that he would detest the Straw Hat Pirates for coming to Whole Cake Island to rescue him, oblivious to the fact that Sanji opposed the wedding and would never willingly speak ill of his friends. Like Big Mom and most of his siblings like his older brother Oven, he considers his own father and stepfathers to not be part of his family because they are not related by blood. Cracker is very confident in his power and prefers to deal with enemies alone, hating outside interference from his fellow crew members. He takes joy in using his Devil Fruit powers and overwhelming his enemies with their versatility; on the other hand, he hates it when people eat his biscuit creations as he does not like giving away biscuits for free. Cracker also absolutely despises feeling any amount of pain, even the prick of a needle, and prefers to fight others with his biscuit creations. He is also very proud of his anonymity, referring to the World Government's incorrect photo of him in his wanted poster. Like the rest of his family, Cracker is very arrogant and views himself superior to his opponents, mocking Luffy throughout most of the fight. He also tends to brag during his fights due to how powerful his Biscuit Soldiers can be. He decided to tell Luffy how his powers worked after the latter was able to discover his true appearance as a mocking gesture. This later proved to be a costly mistake on his part, as Luffy and Nami were able to take advantage of the knowledge Cracker gave them in order to defeat him.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates, Cracker's authority in the crew is second only to his mother's. As the Minister of Biscuit, Cracker rules over Biscuits Island and is responsible for procuring and distributing biscuits to whoever needs them. He is also capable of commanding large fleets into battle. Cracker's voice and presence alone are enough to cause nearby homies to shrink away and wither in fear, indicating that his power commands tremendous fear and respect among his fellow crewmates. His bounty of 860,000,000 indicates that the World Government considers him highly dangerous and threatening to their operations. His power and influence is so great that when he was defeated, Sweet City was put into a state of lockdown. Big Mom was also confident that Cracker could defeat Monkey D. Luffy, who managed to bring down Donquixote Doflamingo, further testifying to his combat strength. Though Urouge of the Worst Generation managed to defeat one of his fellow Sweet Commanders, Cracker defeated him afterward, though he did not manage to kill the Supernova. In battle, Cracker has displayed exceptional skill in deception and trickery; when fighting Luffy, he made it appear as though he had Devil Fruit powers related to multiplying limbs and weapons and when Luffy landed a powerful Gomu Gomu no Kong Gun on his armor, Cracker had it cough up blood-like jam in order to appear badly wounded by the blow. He was able to effectively deceive the entire World Government and the Marines despite being an infamously powerful pirate, being able to conceal his true identity and make his Biscuit Soldier pose as himself to the point his bounty poster depicts the Soldier and not him. Cracker has some degree of culinary skill, as he has created a jam concoction that resembles blood."},

{"name": "Charlotte Linlin", "episode": "Episode 651", "chapter": "Chapter 571", "year": 2012, "note": "She was first mentioned by Kid in Chapter 581. Her real name revealed by Pappag in Chapter 610.", "appearance": "Big Mom is a round, obese old woman with a chin often hidden by her torso. She has an enormous physique, standing at 880 centimeters or just shy of 29 feet tall, which is the largest known height for any human. She is taller than the extremely large Whitebeard and was able to hold the 277cm tall Brook in her hand. Even as a five-year old child, Linlin was already massive to the point she was mistaken for a giant and was as tall as giant children. However, as an adult, she is a little over three meters short of the minimum giant height of 12 meters. She has moderately round, orange eyes, prominent eyelashes, and wears thick purple eyeshadow. She has a very wide mouth with full lips sporting red lipstick, large, round teeth, and a long, thick tongue that often sticks out. She also has long, curly, and wild pink hair that falls halfway down her back, as well as a long beak-like nose, and plump, round cheeks. She also sports a tattoo on her left shoulder and arm, consisting of a large, standard-shaped red heart framed by thin lines curled at their bottom ends, which all tops a far smaller heart. When she was five years old, Linlin towered over normal humans and was about the same size as a giant child. She had a much rounder face and had freckles on her cheeks, her hair was kept into two buns on both sides of her head. Her nose was more triangular compared to present-day where it now protrudes outward in a rounded, beak-like shape. She wore a polka-dotted dress very similar to the one she currently wears, but with this one reaching her neck and having a bow at the top. At the start of her pirating career, Linlin's hair grew longer, and she donned a dark sunhat. At 28 years old, Linlin looked drastically different compared to both her early childhood days and her later years. She was remarkably slimmer and had a visible neck, chin, and jawline, and her features were significantly smaller and more proportionate to her face. Her hair was long, yet considerably less wild than in the present day, and she had a large strand of hair falling to the left side of her face. In Oda's depiction of her at this time, she wore a dark fedora with a polka dot pattern, a bandana, and a dark, polka dotted top with a captain's coat draped over her shoulders. She had a similar appearance (although shadowed) during her time in the Rocks Pirates. At 48 years old, her neck was considerably larger and more muscular than it was at 28 and she had a much larger, more pronounced jaw. By this time, she had already begun wearing Napoleon and her polka-dotted bandana. Five years ago, at age 63, her physique has become very much similar to currently at age 68, and she wore a purple and pink vertical stripped dress. During her first appearance, Big Mom was shown to often drool large quantities of saliva when talking. When in her regular fits of rage from not having a certain food at her direct disposal or simply when extremely furious her pupils take on a spiral appearance. Big Mom wears a large pink bicorne hat bearing a Jolly Roger on the front. She has worn two versions: the first design consisted of a standard skull with crossbones behind it, as well as large flame-like patterns to the sides, whereas the current version, named Napoleon, has two crossed sabers instead of crossbones, possesses smaller lateral flame patterns, and is imbued with a fragment of her soul, causing its skull to change expressions and talk to Big Mom; on its top, the hat is edged with a thick yellow streak, it has a strip snap-fastened to it, and beneath it is a light, polka-dotted bandana fastened around Big Mom's head. Big Mom also dons a pink dress with red polka dots and white ruffles on its neckline and hemline, with a wide, rippling white cape attached to its back that falls to the ground. The outfit is completed with dark blue high heels, one turquoise pearl wristband on either wrist, and golden, jeweled rings on all her fingers. Hours after her craving fit for wedding cake started, Big Mom was noted to have gotten slimmer and slimmer up to the point where she has become emaciated. She went back to her usual appearance after eating Sanji's wedding cake. As O-Lin during the Wano Country Arc, she wears her hair in a shimada. During the Fire Festival, she changed into a black furisode kimono with a white minimalist floral pattern, over a light pink robe, tied with a yellow polka-dotted red sash tied in a bow. She also wears a more elaborate shimada.", "abilities_and_powers": "As formerly one of the Four Emperors, Big Mom was recognized as one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. As the only female member, this effectively makes Big Mom the single most powerful female pirate in the world. Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter stated that Big Mom is one of the few people capable of stopping Blackbeard. When her fellow former Emperor Kaidou, known as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", threatened to kill her if she came to his territory, Big Mom simply invited him to try and said he would not be able to dissuade her. Even the Straw Hat Pirates recognized that she could crush them quickly and easily if they fought her recklessly. As the captain of the Big Mom Pirates, Big Mom has amassed an extremely powerful crew, as well as several strong subordinates such as Jinbe, a fish-man and former Warlord of the Sea, and Capone Bege, a member of the Worst Generation. She possesses considerable influence within the Underworld as well, having connections to the Vinsmoke Family, which leads the legendary Germa 66. Those who marry her children automatically become part of her crew. While under Big Mom's protection, Fish-Man Island was protected from pirate attacks, indicating a powerful influence similar to that of the late Whitebeard. She is known to destroy entire countries over sweets and is intimidating enough that even her underlings Pekoms and Tamago, who are powerful in their own right, are afraid of talking to her when she is angered. In fact, almost everyone, including her own children, has been shown to fear her. Ironically, this fear makes Big Mom stronger due to the nature of her Devil Fruit powers. Big Mom's arrival during a battle between her crew and the Sun Pirates and Germa 66 brought great jubilation to her crew, indicating that her presence would likely turn the tide of the battle in their favor. After regaining her memory Big Mom was also able to scare Queen of the Beast Pirates, with the latter even admitting that he did not stand a chance in battle against her, despite having defied her when she was amnesiac over oshiruko earlier. Even after being captured and held by pure Seastone chains and kept under watch of all three All-Stars of the Beasts Pirates, the crew continued to feed her sweets to keep her in a good mood, while constantly fearing her presence alone. In spite of Big Mom's incredible strength, her greatest weakness is her wavering mental state. Whenever she enters her craving sickness, she will act wild and out of control, endangering everyone around her, including her allies, and becoming unable to think or act rationally until she gets the food she is craving. Similarly, if her portrait of Mother Carmel is damaged in any way, Big Mom will suffer a mental breakdown, falling to her knees and crying while becoming completely oblivious to everything around her, even when threatened, as seen during Bege's assassination attempt. At the early age of six, Linlin's first known bounty was 50,000,000, implying that even at such a young age she was considered a significant threat. This bounty later increased to at least 500,000,000 and due to her status as a former Emperor, her current bounty is 4,388,000,000.", "personality": "As Carmel noted, Linlin was once a truly kind-hearted little girl. At five years old, Linlin tried to help people and even animals such as a bear and a wolf. However, her benevolent intentions ended up with dangerously violent results due to her monstrous strength and innocent simplicity, as she slapped a bear for devouring a wolf, accidentally killing it in the process. She also fractured a giant's bones while trying to smack a mosquito on him. Linlin even cried in genuine remorse after she accidentally killed the bear. She would also try to \"fix\" the appearances of her fellow orphans, which was actually attempting to tear off their racial features, being unable to understand the harm she was inflicting. This has carried over to her current situation, as while her dream of creating a country without discrimination is noble, she's willing to use violence and extortion to force people to follow her commands. While Linlin grew up normally as a kind and innocent little girl, she became more selfish and cruel over time, due to neither Carmel nor Streusen ever bothering to teach her any morals as well as taking advantage of her inhuman strength and naivety. Despite her age, Linlin has childish tendencies. After capturing Brook, Linlin playfully patted and caressed the living skeleton and carried Brook with her to sleep at night like a teddy bear and cried hysterically when she thought Brook had died. When Carmel's photo was destroyed and shown to her, Linlin even broke down crying like a baby as she recalls the time when she was a five-year-old girl, questioning why Carmel left her behind. She refers to herself with \"ore\" (?), an aggressive masculine form of \"I\", instead of the gender-neutral \"watashi\" (?) that most other females use. Like many others, Big Mom has a distinct style of laughing: \"Mamamama\". However, she has also laughed in a normal \"Hahahahahaha\" style (occasionally with a drawn-out \"Haaaaaaaa\" at the beginning,) and has even combined it with her unique laughter in the form of \"Haaaaaahahamamamama\"."},

{"name": "Charlotte Brûlée", "episode": "Episode 831", "chapter": "Chapter 791", "year": 2016, "note": "Real appearance was revealed in Chapter 832.", "appearance": "Brle looks in many respects like the stereotypical witch. She is an extremely tall, slightly hunched, and gray-skinned woman with a well-endowed yet thin figure, which makes her limbs appear to be exceptionally long. She stands at roughly twice Nami's height (170cm), with her legs alone being noticeably longer than said woman is overall. She also has very long, gnarled fingers with overlong, sharp nails painted blue. The woman's face has very striking, hag-like features. Her droopy eyes have yellow irises and long lashes, and are topped by viridian eye shadow and black, high-arched eyebrows, which she keeps perpetually furrowed. She has a huge and over-projected, reddish hook nose (similar to her mother's), a large mouth with purple lipstick that is usually seen devilishly smiling, a square jaw, and a brown, sharp-cornered scar stretching diagonally down her face from right to left. Brle's hair is lavender and divided into two side locks that cascade over her breasts, as well as four other, similarly long, and sharp, lock-like segments that stick to the sides, slightly curved upward. She takes to wearing a whitish, creased gown. Its main upper section has a frilly scoop neckline, loose, flaring sleeves that are tattered at the edges, and stops quite below the waist in a frilled hemline, adorned by a horizontal row of red roses above. The lower, seemingly separate part of the dress, which begins under the upper one, falls to the ground and, too, has roses stitched onto itself in the aforementioned manner. Brle's clothing is completed by a feathered, sleeveless overcoat in moss green color (the latter, in addition to her grayish skin, earning her comparison to a tree by Carrot and to a branch by Monkey D. Luffy). When she was taken to Capone Bege's hideout, her attire is forcefully changed into a more clean and elegant dress by the Fire Tank Pirates, which is also light in color, with two frilled hemlines and closer-fitting sleeves, as well as a light-colored coat above with actual sleeves and a light fur trim. Her hair was brushed into two sideward wicks. But after being saved by Katakuri, she changed her hair back to having four locks. As a young child, Brle's hair was shorter and partitioned into eight locks, and her nose was small, cone-shaped, and a paler shade of red. Her skin was also a pale beige-gray color. She wore a white short sleeve dress with flowers around the neckline.", "personality": "Brle is prideful, as she was rather offended when Carrot referred to her as a talking tree and Luffy called her a branch, as well as when her mother sent Charlotte Cracker to fight the Straw Hats in her stead due to not considering her powerful enough. Brle is confident in her powers and claims that she could kill the Straw Hats in an instant, not liking to be underestimated. Due to the terrible scar on her face, she is envious of those with alluring faces to the point that she wants to slice them up. Her jealousy is also tempered with a very sadistic nature as shown when she intended to boil Carrot alive, Brle was excited in disfiguring Carrot's face with horrible burns. She scoffs at the notion of anyone succeeding against an Emperor like Big Mom, believing it to be ridiculous and impossible. She also thinks very little of the Worst Generation, believing their actions in the first half of the Grand Line were not that big of an achievement. Like most of her siblings, Brle is arrogant and has the upmost pride in her crew and family. This is shown when she boasted to Luffy about Katakuri's strength and how he had never lost before. This leads her to underestimate her opponents, as she was shocked to learn that Brook managed to get copies of the Poneglyphs and hid them from Big Mom, and became devastated when Katakuri was defeated by Luffy. Brle seems to share her mother's dream of creating a paradise with every race united, and finds great joy in discovering new kinds of creatures, especially animals. However, she seems to be extremely close-minded about non-humans, as she considers minks to be mere animals and has no qualms about threatening to consume them, even disregarding their begging for mercy. She also thinks very little of her mother's husbands, as she jeeringly declared her ex-stepfather, Pound, an enemy with no chance of returning from his actions. She also cackled with glee when revealing that none of Big Mom's affiliates could leave her alive. Brle is very loyal to her mother, as she followed her orders to keep Luffy and his group away from Sanji. She is also loyal to her family, as she went with Katakuri's plans to ambush the Straw Hats on their ship. She detests traitors, yelling angrily at Jinbe when she discovered him with the Sanji Retrieval Team, as well as questioning Chiffon in her participation in her husband's plot to assassinate their mother. She also became enraged at Pekoms for using her to assist Luffy in escaping. Brle is noted by her own family to be very careless and clumsy as proven when she easily ended up getting herself captured by her enemies for them to exploit her Devil Fruit powers as shown with Chopper and Luffy. Due to her arrogance and carelessness, Brle is very cowardly if she is caught in a helpless situation that would endanger her life. When Brle was being used by the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates, she became terrified if her mother considered her a traitor and that she would be killed. When Luffy found her while he was retreating from Katakuri, Brle became terrified as she was taken hostage to escape the Mirro-World while pleading to Katakuri to save her. On Nuts Island, after being spotted, Brle pleaded for Perospero and Amande, and a deranged Big Mom to save her. Brle is tricky and deceptive, using her Devil Fruit to separate Luffy from his group by disguising as him and deceiving the retrieval team, and managed to capture Carrot in the Mirro-World. Though she is not always perceptive, as she failed to notice the frog transformed into Carrot was not actually speaking and also did not piece together that the duplicate mink came from her own Devil Fruit ability. Brle also seems very susceptible to tickle torture, as she easily gave Chopper and Carrot all the answers they needed when they tickled her. Despite being usually cruel to enemies, Brle has a kind and caring side as she genuinely loved her family, as she was crying when the Whole Cake Chateau was falling over with her family on it. Even as a child, she tried to comfort Katakuri, telling him not to blame himself for her brutal disfigurement by his bullies. She also tearfully reported Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands to her family and crew in order to ensure that neither he nor Sanji manage to escape. However, she was more concerned about Katakuri being hurt by Luffy rather than his loss against the latter. Brle cares for her brother in high regards, that she knew that Katakuri lays on his back and kept quiet about it out of respect towards him. Like other people, Brle has a unique laughing style: \"Wiwwiwwiwwi\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Brle holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members. Brle is a fairly powerful fighter, as Big Mom had enough confidence in her to prevent the Sanji Retrieval Team from escaping the Seducing Woods. She is also capable of coordinating with several homies in the forest to fight against them. However, her family notes that Brle is actually very clumsy and not as strong as she perceives herself. True enough, Chopper and Carrot were able to defeat her by using her powers against her and was even captured by an exhausted Luffy when he needed to escape from his fight with Katakuri. She was also easily captured by Pekoms and held hostage. Brle possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream."},
{"name": "Charlos", "episode": "Episode 499", "chapter": "Chapter 393", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Charlos has the same hairstyle as his father and sister. He has a wide, obese face and what appears to be stubble around his thick-lipped mouth. He always has snot hanging from one of his nostrils, which he regularly picks at. As a Celestial Dragon, he wears the typical full-body, thick white suit of obese frame that resembles a spacesuit with medals or buttons on it, with a green collar, and a resin bubble that grants him a supply of oxygen separate from the ones commoners breathe.", "personality": "Charlos is more of a spoiled brat in comparison to his sister and lacks a sense of responsibility. His personality can be compared to Helmeppo's when Luffy first met him, although seemingly worse. While he shares the same disregard for commoners as his rest of World Nobles, he is more prone to acting immature or violent than they are. While his family shows commoners where their place is whenever they pass by, Charlos purposely goes out of his way to make it clear. He made his slave suffer like his sister did, but his sister simply shot her slave whereas he pushed his slave to the limits until he collapsed, and then sold him off to ensure the man's continued suffering. He also seems to have a very strong need for confirmation from his father, as he constantly wants him to see and acknowledge his actions. Due to his completelyspoiled nature and arrogance as a World Noble, Charlos is extremely selfish and unreasonable.Considering himself a god, he believeshe has the right to cruelly enslaveanyone including royalty and willruthlessly murderanyone who refusesto comply with his demandsas is shown when he ordered Rob Lucci to kill Neptune when he attemptedto savehis own daughter from him. Like any World Noble, Charlos demands absolute respect and obedience from commoners and will not tolerate anyone who dares to defy him. This was shown when he was aghast when he saw that Zoro wasn't bowing to him like the others and immediately shot at him when Zoro spoke to him. He also shot at Luffy when he walked right up to him in order to punch him. He won't even accept defiance from a fellow Celestial Dragon, like when he swore revenge on Saint Mjosgard for hitting him with a club to prevent him from taking Shirahoshi. He also wastes money, as seen by his committing to spend an absurd amount of money on Camie while just intending to put her in a tank full of piranhas and watch her swim for her life. He generally does not bother much with details and leaves his escorts to handle the issues of things like paperwork. He also has a habit of picking his nose all the time. Charlos is an incredibly foolish and ignorant man, showing no form of maturity or common sense no matter how many beatings he receives. Even after being attacked by Mjosgard for his actions in trying to enslave Shirahoshi, he learned nothing from the ordeal and still tried to enslave her again later by using Kuma as a weapon. Again, for his actions gets him brutally beaten up by Sai and Leo as they flatten his head while Mjosgard takes responsibility for attacking him. Charlos is obsessed with mermaids, having spent a massive amount of money just to buy Camie. After taking an interest in Shirahoshi, Charlos went as far as to openly attempt to enslave her during the Levely. There seems to be a running gag for this, as every time he tries to enslave a princess mermaid for his own entertainment and selfishness, he gets a consequently beating from others learning nothing from his actions, being brutally beaten up by Luffy, Mjosgard, Sai and Leo. His actions can be considered even more abusive and extreme than the rest of the ordinary World Nobles.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, Charlos has immense political power to do as he pleases and can summon an admiral if he is harmed in any way. His authority allows him to enslave anyone, even royalty, and he can order CP0 to assassinate people or protect him. Physically, Charlos is very weak despite his large body, as he would rather be carried around by a slave than walk, and was easily knocked out with one punch by Luffy and when struck by Mjosgard with a mace. He seems to have good eyesight as he could see Zoro moving at a fast speed, though he is not very bright as he believed that Zoro was killed by the bullet that he dodged, when Bonney actually acted by pushing Zoro down and covering him in tomato sauce."},

Amande is very loyal to her mother and will execute any mission she is given, with no qualms about killing enemies. She seems to be highly ruthless and sadistic at the same time, as she claims there is no meaning in slaughter without grievously tormenting the victim first as shown when she sliced through Kingbaum, in doing so she wanted to make sure that his death would be long and agonizing, even though he tried to explain himself of his powerlessness against the Straw Hats.

He leaves his chest bare, with something that appears to be a large wrestling belt with his jolly roger on it. His hair appears to come out of the top of his tricorne and is braided back. After his encounter with Hawkins just before the timeskip, he lost the use of his legs. He is now an alligator centaur, thanks to the efforts of Caesar Clown and Trafalgar Law. His lower body consists of four alligator legs and a tail. He also added a maroon colored jacket with fur-rimmed gloves, fitting for the cold nature of Punk Hazard.", "personality": "Upon his introduction, Brownbeard was rather arrogant, as he claimed an island as under his protection, and addressed himself as \"Brownbeard-sama\", \"sama\" being an honorific of something like \"lord\" or \"master\"; this led him to proudly show off his bounty in an attempt to intimidate his opponents, despite it being lower than the New World average of 100,000,000, as well as being worth less than one-third of said opponent's bounty. He was angry when the Straw Hat Pirates claimed that they had never heard of him before he bragged about his own name, and coupled with how Basil Hawkins claimed his name was a joke, seemed to make him start to doubt his level of recognition, to the point he was joyfully surprised when the G-5 Marines recognized him. He seems to be an opportunist, as he attacked an island that was once under Whitebeard's protection right after the great pirate's demise. Although he thinks himself as powerful, he is shown to know when his opponent out-classes him; he became terrified when he realized that he was fighting someone, who had a bounty of 400,000,000 at the time. After two years, it would seem that his defeat at the hands of Basil Hawkins has humbled Brownbeard. Contrary to how he acted before the timeskip, he now truly values camaraderie and friendship. He deeply cares about his crew as well as the other former prisoners whom he had befriended, aiding the Straw Hats when he realized that Caesar was merely using him and the other prisoners as guinea pigs, and grew angry at Caesar once he discovered that; this anger grew stronger when Caesar revealed that he was the one who caused the poison gas explosion four years ago, not Vegapunk. His perception of the Straw Hat Pirates also changed once he realized Caesar's true nature. Like many other characters, Brownbeard has his own unique laugh, which is \"Uohhohho\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Since Brownbeard is a former New World pirate captain, it can be assumed that he has a decent amount of strength, though he was no match for a member of the Worst Generation. As the boss of the Centaur Patrol Squad, he held some authority on Punk Hazard prior to Caesar dismissing him. He seems to possess endurance that can easily be seen as superhuman, since he survived getting shot point-blank multiple times by Scotch's massive gun, and even being blown away by Caesar's attack afterwards, an attack that was powerful enough to eradicate the remains of the laboratory ruins they were all in. He was even able to move after all those ordeals, without showing any signs of strain, although he was obviously wounded. Even after Caesar injecting him with a muscle relaxant, Brownbeard was still able to force himself to stand and retaliate with his sword. He was also able to endure being openly fired upon by Caesar's subordinates and not pass out. Having his original legs crippled by Basil Hawkins, he was transformed into an alligator centaur; his new legs enable him to carry a group of people with ease so the Straw Hats use him as a means of transportation. He can also run very fast. Brownbeard had some tactical intelligence. After observing Luffy deflecting his troop's cannon shots, he deduced that Luffy is a Devil Fruit user and that his men could kill him by aiming at the water near Luffy's boat to capsize it."},

Her pants now have a pair of belts closing its hems. She also carries a sword on her right hip.", "personality": "Devon seems loyal to Blackbeard after he freed her from Impel Down. When the Marines recognized her for the first time, she mentioned that she \"likes them too\" which suggests that she is a somewhat sarcastic person. She also preferred to receive new clothes in exchange of the prisoners' uniform that she dislikes wearing. She is obsessed with collecting beautiful women's heads, such as when she declared that she admired the beauty of Boa Hancock and that her head would make a \"wonderful trophy\". Devon seems to have a romantic preference for women, as she is seen surrounding herself with adoring female admirers on Hachinosu, and was also affected by Boa Hancock's Devil Fruit ability. She has a sadistic side, as seen when she mocked Gecko Moria over the death of his subordinate Absalom, whom she masqueraded as to give Moria a false sense of hope. Like other characters in One Piece, she has a distinct laughter: \"Murunfuffuffu\" (?, VIZ: \"Murun hu hu hu\").", "abilities_and_powers": "Over the two-year timeskip, Catarina Devon has become promoted to the Captain of the Sixth Ship serves as a testament of Teach's trust in her powers, along with granting her the authority over the lower-ranking members Catarina Devon is one of the most powerful female pirates to have ever lived and when she was imprisoned in Impel Down, she was placed in level 6 were only the worst criminals in the world are locked up. Another testament to her power is the fact that when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he only chose the strongest ones that could survive when pitted against everyone else in a free-for-all battle. Thus, Catarina Devon is one of the strongest Level 6 prisoners. "},
{"name": "Cavendish", "episode": "Episode 704", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Cavendish is considered very attractive by both women and men, who often faint upon seeing him. His bright sky blue eyes are drawn in a style Oda usually uses for women. He is a lean yet muscular man with long, flowing blond hair that reaches just past his shoulders. He is fairly tall, standing at a height of 208 cm. He wears a black cowboy hat with a large aqua blue colored plume. He sports a ruffled white v-neck shirt under a coat draped over his shoulders. His trousers are dark purple in the anime, but are dark purple and have a thin white stripe on the sides and end in a ruffle just below a pale yellow and aqua blue star on each knee in the anime. In the manga the stripes are orange. Each of his brown high-heeled boots have bronze buckles attached by dark purple straps just above each ankle. He carries his sword Durandal on his left side, as he is right-handed. When possessed by his alter ego, Hakuba, his face slightly changes and gets a demonic appearance. His face becomes shadowed, his eyes become completely white, and his mouth is opened in a permanent sneer with no teeth showing whilst smiling. All-in-all, his face resembles the grinning mask from the two masks which symbolize drama, though it resembles the gloomy mask when frowning. His hair also comes loose from its ringlets, becoming a bit unkempt, and in the anime it becomes slightly dull. His voice also changes from mild-mannered and cultured to gruff and murderous. When both personalities are fighting for control of the same body, his face twists into what Bartolomeo considers \"half-and-half\", its features mixed between the two personalities split right down the middle. In the anime, the eye on Cavendish's dominant side also turns yellow-orange (it is unknown if this is Hakuba's actual eye color when his expression is not in its default manic state or an artistic choice to better differentiate between the two personalities, as Hakuba is always seen with featureless blank white eyes when in full control of Cavendish's body) while Hakuba's dominant side retains Cavendish's natural blue eye. When transformed into a toy, he has a round-shaped head with a cone hat and he wears a polka dotted shirt.", "personality": "Because of his good looks, Cavendish is extremely haughty, prideful, arrogant, boastful and vain, and loves attracting attention. Because of this, he harbors a deep-seated resentment towards the Worst Generation for stealing the spotlight from him two years ago. He even stabs their wanted posters to vent his anger. He is also shown to get deeply annoyed when the person he is talking to ignores him. Due to his petty jealousy, he is even willing to kill those he is jealous of with his own hands and will not let anyone get in his way as shown when he tried to fend off Chinjao, a former pirate who also wanted to kill his intended target at the time. Cavendish is also prepared to kill anyone who plans to take his prey away from him such as Bartolomeo. Despite his extreme narcissism and pettiness, he has an animal-loving nature, in particular towards to his horse and steed, Farul. He became enraged when his animal companion and dearest friend was badly wounded, and he immediately sought revenge on the Donquixote Pirates, showing that he has a deep emotional attachment to his animal friend and companion. Due to his royal heritage as a prince, Cavendish is highly sophisticated with a great penchant for fanciness as his make-shift meal after the B block was a posh-looking dinner on a tablecloth, with wine and a fancy main course, all of which was served by a waiter. He seems to be quite sociable as he tried to have a conversation with \"Lucy\" (unaware at first that he was actually Monkey D. Luffy, one of the Supernovas Cavendish hates), despite him being a total stranger. He can be very polite and civil even to people with bad reputations, as he congratulated Bartolomeo for his win despite his bad image. He has once been seen eating a rose he was carrying around, due to roses being his favorite food. He loathes others who have gained popularity, specifically those who take attention away from him, but will become immensely happy when he manages to recapture the spotlight, as shown during his speech to the spectators at the Coliseum defending Rebecca. However he seems unable to turn down a request from a \"fan\". This is shown when he accepts Luffy's request to get the others off of the King's Plateau, after mistakenly believing that the Straw Hat is his fan. While he deeply loathes those who gained immense popularity, he shows sympathy for those who are extremely unpopular as shown when he stood up for Rebecca when the audience booed and jeered at her. He is somewhat honorable as he stated to the audience that a warrior's life is not something one should put up for show and that those who are not willing to risk their own lives have no right to scorn. After seeing Usopp confronting Sugar and Trebol, Cavendish begged him to succeed while promising he won't go after Luffy anymore. After being freed from Sugar's curse, Cavendish kept his word as he ceased his grudge against Luffy. This also extends to Zoro and Law. Later on, his love for honor returned when he refused to leave Law alone after he was defeated by Doflamingo, stating that if Law is determined to die if Luffy is defeated, it would only be after Cavendish dies protecting him. During Doflamingo's \"Birdcage\", Cavendish displays being level-headed and is quite perceptive. He knew that Doflamingo was never planning on sparing Dressrosa after his exposure even if the people complied with the tyrant's demands. When he was in the underground trade port, Cavendish deduced that if Doflamingo is defeated, Luffy and Law would be at the center of the wrath of the people Doflamingo made deals with. True to his words, when he and his allies were fleeing Dressrosa, an army of ships came to the island to exact their revenge on the two. Cavendish possesses a split personality known as Hakuba, which appears only when Cavendish falls asleep. Hakuba is both cruel and merciless, and attacks the people around him with incredible speed while wearing a demonic grin on his face, disappearing only once everyone has been defeated. Cavendish is aware of Hakuba's existence and, by sheer willpower, is able to suppress him to a certain degree when he does not wish him to be present. However, the two tend to argue over the control of their body, where in one case was when Cavendish was upset with how Hakuba chose to attack Robin. Despite his faults, Cavendish is shown to be very righteous and upright, as he defended Rebecca from the audience's vicious insults despite being completely strangers, leading Luffy to be impressed by him despite their initial enmity. He later showed disdain on how Sugar turns her own soldiers into toys. He also strongly criticized his alter ego Hakuba's murderous and blood thirsty nature, and is willingly to physically hurt himself to restrain his alter ego. He can be generous as he also gave his coat to Robin after she was injured by Diamante's spiked iron balls to stop the bleeding. When as Cavendish, he refers to himself with \"boku\" (?), a young boyish way of saying \"I\", but as Hakuba, he uses \"ore\" (?), a more masculine version of \"I\".", "abilities_and_powers": "The fact that he has a 330,000,000 bounty indicates that he is quite powerful despite not having eaten a Devil Fruit. Three years ago, he was an infamous and feared pirate known to the world before being upstaged by all the Supernovas from the Worst Generation. With his \"beautiful\" appearance, he is able to make women faint from looking at him. Cavendish owns a white stallion called Farul and possesses excellent horsemanship skills, being able to skillfully ride Farul up the highly complex terrain of the New King plateau while carrying Law, Luffy and Kyros. He is also a very charismatic person who is able to sway the crowd in his favor."},
{"name": "Carrot", "episode": "Episode 804", "chapter": "Chapter 753", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Carrot is a white-furred, blonde-haired rabbit mink with brown eyes, rabbit ears, a rabbit-like nose, a large round fluffy tail, but with a body otherwise similar to that of a human adolescent girl. She seems to be short when compared to normal-sized people like Roronoa Zoro, Wanda, Sanji, or even Nami. In her first appearance, she wore a short orange dress with laced-up open sides with the Guardians' signature green cape, a single rabbit paw-like gauntlet, and brown, high-heeled boots. Upon sneaking aboard the Thousand Sunny, she changed to a similar short orange dress with the word \"RABBIT\" at the front with a thick darker orange trim and a single white stripe in the middle, a black cap, and yellow loafers. She also had a backpack and a canteen. Later on, she was seen wearing another short orange dress with a puffy skirt and a hood, and retained her cap and loafers. After reaching Totto Land, Carrot donned a simple, light-green short-skirt dress decorated with three vertical stripes running down the center and frills at the bottom, neck, and sleeves, and tied up at the front with an orange bow, as well as a pair of orange dress shoes. An additional accessory includes an orange hat. At the meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, she wore a flapper-style outfit of a white cloche hat with a pink rose, a sleeveless white blouse with a frilly collar and pink ribbon, a frilly black skirt, and black pumps. Her outfit had different colors (yellow blouse, red skirt, and orange pumps) in the original \"Hope\" opening. At the start of the Wano Country Arc, she wore a simple short salmon pink halter dress with a carrot design and the word \"Ninjin\" (Japanese for \"Carrot\"), as well as frills at the bottom. After Kin'emon used his powers to disguise her as a kunoichi, Carrot donned a light polka-dotted veil concealing her ears, a light green kimono with orange and green floral prints, and simple straw sandals. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. Her outfit consists of a strapless green bikini armor, lighter green shoulder pads with white edges, and a furry magenta cape, however it appears black in the manga. During her training under Shishilian, she wore a red musketeer hat and a light-green dress with thin straps, and her hair was slightly shorter. When Carrot activates her Sulong form on a full moon, her eyes turn red, her ears grow larger, her hair and tail grow considerably and turn snow white in color, and they both emit Electro sparks. The fur around her neckline turns much thicker, vaguely resembling a lion's mane, and her claws become longer and sharper. Upon seeing this form, Nami considers it to be \"so beautiful.\" and Jinbe comments that \"it's quite mesmerizing.\"", "personality": "Carrot is very protective of the Mokomo Dukedom and is highly aggressive towards intruders. Like other minks, she refers to humans as \"lesser minks\". Carrot is also protective of people she cares about. When the Straw Hat Pirates were met by Germa 66, Carrot was willing to fight the evil army in order to protect them. She can also be very emotional; when Monkey D. Luffy ate poisonous fish skin and was left on the verge of death, Carrot begged him not to die and tearfully embraced him once the poison was sucked out of him. After Pedro sacrificed himself in a suicidal explosion, Carrot became devastated and cried profoundly before becoming enraged to where she attempted to take it out on Katakuri. Like a regular rabbit, she likes to gnaw on things, including people such as Luffy. She loves carrots to the point where her provisions for the trip to Whole Cake Island consisted entirely of them, and she ferociously attacked Luffy when she saw him eating her carrot. She also loves chocolate. Though feral and vicious when attacking someone, Carrot can be quickly calmed down if someone pats her head. Despite her warrior status, she seems to be naive and childish about serious matters and the world beyond Zou; she was easily excited by events new to her; when she heard Luffy was planning to crash Big Mom's party and ruin the wedding ceremony, she believed it would be exciting to take part in, not realizing the extreme danger she would be facing in doing so, and she was later surprised to hear that it would take several days to reach Whole Cake Island because of how big the ocean was, having believed that it was small enough to only warrant half a day's worth of provisions. Additionally, she is not familiar with some natural weather phenomena, having mistaken lightning for Electro upon witnessing it at sea. She has always wanted to see the outside world and go on an adventure, and upon her discovery aboard the Thousand Sunny, she begged Pedro not to take her home immediately out of fear of being berated by Wanda. She is apparently scared of ghosts as she was frightened by Brook's soul form. Despite her naivete, she has also proven that she can be rather clever and deceiving; she quickly devised a plot to use Charlotte Brle's mirror based powers against her and successfully fooled several Big Mom Pirates into thinking that they had captured her. Whenever she transforms into her Sulong form, Carrot seemingly becomes more confident and vicious in combat. However, despite her drastic change in appearance and abilities, she still maintained her original personality, as shown when she blushed while fighting Charlotte Daifuku's crew. However, she proved to be more cunning than usual, as when she removed the steering wheel off of Daifuku's ship to keep them from going after the Sunny, and when she tricked his genie into attacking its master's fleet.", "abilities_and_powers": "Carrot has proven to be a strong warrior. Upon noticing that Monkey D. Luffy was eating her carrot, an enraged Carrot quickly overwhelmed him before being calmed down, although this was an oversight on the part of the pirate; this prompted Pedro, an extremely strong mink warrior and captain of the Guardians to vouch for her usefulness in a fight. Carrot possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Carmel", "episode": "Episode 866", "chapter": "Chapter 836", "year": 2017, "note": "Her name was first mentioned by Capone Bege in Chapter 859. She was first seen via a photograph in Chapter 861.", "appearance": "Carmel was an elderly woman with a large, wrinkled face and a square-shaped jawline. She had long, wavy gray hair and wore lipstick. She wore dark blue nun's robes that have light blue frills on them, as well as a similarly-designed headdress. She was always seen either smoking a cigarette or holding one in her hand. At age 43, Carmel had blonde hair, no wrinkles on her face, and lacked lipstick. She was described at the time as \"beautiful\".", "personality": "Carmel was a shrewd businesswoman, raising large varieties of children in order to sell them. She was particularly interested in establishing relationships with powerful people in order to increase her influence, as shown when she put on an act with the Marines in order to gain connections to Elbaf and acquire children that she can sell at a higher value. Although she appeared to be a benevolent woman who cared for her children like a mother with a ceaseless smile, this was all an act in order to maintain her business, and she did not truly care about her children's well-being beyond ensuring they were fit to sell. She even admitted that she could not stand them, and that it took a lot of effort to act as a loving mother. Carmel takes pride in the quality of her work, and is not above bringing up her own accomplishments while making deals.", "abilities_and_powers": "Carmel has shown herself to be an extremely charismatic orator and actress. Working with the government, she managed to fool the nation of Elbaf into thinking she wanted to help them by staging a rescue of the Giant Warrior Pirates. Her speech of benevolence and mercy even moved the condemned giant pirates to tears. The giants of Elbaf, including Jorul and Jarul, even held great respect for Carmel's claimed ideology in pacifism despite their dedication to militarism. She could also care for dozens of children of many varieties even in her old age, most notably Charlotte Linlin, as she was one of the few people whose words could quell Linlin's impulses. However, her capabilities were not absolute, as Linlin eventually snapped and went on a rampage after a week without food. A renowned seller in the Underworld, Carmel had connections to people as powerful as Cipher Pol and directly aided them by providing them with child spies. She was able to successfully negotiate an immensely high price for Linlin despite their initial hesitance. In return, the government gave her help in establishing good relations with Elbaf."},

Unlike them, however, he shows no prejudice against humans.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a fish-man, Capote possesses strength tenfold that of average humans, and double that in water.

{"name": "Caribou", "episode": "Episode 600", "chapter": "Chapter 519", "year": 2010, "note": "He was first mentioned by Demaro Black in Chapter 598.", "appearance": "Caribou is a tall man with dark skin and dark hair reaching down to his shoulders, a distinctive wet-looking tuft giving him his epithet, and a beard in the shape of a whirl going upwards on his chin. He has intimidating eyes with many circles around the pupils (with dark and medium green central heterochromia in the anime), pointed ears, and long limbs. He has a long tongue which is often seen sticking out. He wears a coat which appears to be made of fur, dark on the outside and lighter and spotted on the inside (similar to a leopard's), draped over his shoulders like a cape, dark pants and shoes, and an extremely long-sleeved shirt (which at Sabaody was covered in blood) with a Cross fleury-like design on the chest. With the way he wears his shirt, concealing his arms under his long sleeves, it resembles an unbuckled straitjacket. After being found and looked after by an old woman on a winter island in the New World, Caribou is seen wearing a coat, which has a darker color than his previous one and a fluffy collar, draped onto his shoulders. He is also wearing plaid pajamas and thick winter boots. He soon went back to wearing his old long sleeved attire, but then wears a revolutionary uniform jacket draped over his shoulders, along with a beret with a star on it. After becoming a prisoner in Wano Country, Caribou kept his long sleeve shirt, but acquired standard prisoner striped pants and tattered trousers, as well as handcuffs and sandals.", "personality": "Caribou is an insanely violent man who is well-known for killing people, most prominently Marines, by burying them alive. Caribou believes in God, and frequently justifies his murders by claiming to do it for the sake of his god. He will also ask his god to forgive enemies that work against him, showing a very egotistical personality. Caribou seeks the fame of killing important people, and is constantly plotting ways to target his next victim; he joined what was seemingly the Straw Hat Pirates in order to kill their members from within, and sought to attack the real Straw Hats as soon as they appeared. He is extremely prideful, as he decided to shoot a Marine rather than use him as a shield like the Fake Straw Hat Crew commanded because the Marine had lied to him. He also seems to be overconfident in his Logia Devil Fruit power, as he dismissed Pekoms' Zoan ability and attacked him with no caution, causing Pekoms to defeat him with one blow. Caribou is very greedy and loves to get money and treasure by any means necessary. He has no problem with selling captives on the slave market, and upon reaching Fish-Man Island he immediately took the opportunity to kidnap as many mermaids as possible to sell them, only releasing them once he managed to steal the Ryugu Palace's entire treasury. When he saw Pekoms and Tamago walking away with his stolen treasure, Caribou immediately became angry and rushed to attack them, causing him to be quickly defeated. Caribou is also rather lecherous, as he immediately started ogling Nami upon seeing her, contemplated hiding in the women's quarters on the Thousand Sunny, and took great pleasure when talking to the group of mermaids he captured. He likes to use his Devil Fruit abilities to move around in disguise and listen in on conversations that reveal things he can take advantage of. Upon hearing of the Ancient Weapons, Caribou became very interested in their potential to destroy the entire world, and sought to kidnap Poseidon and divulge Pluton's location to a certain individual. Caribou prioritizes his own safety at all times and will almost always attempt to escape whenever he encounters a situation that he recognizes is too dangerous for him. He will even abandon his comrades to get to safety, as shown when he left his crew behind to fight the Marines at the G-5 base. When he is surrounded by enemies with no way of escape, Caribou will try to stay alive by pledging to serve them, although people typically know his oaths of fealty are lies. Caribou will use other people around him to his advantage whenever possible, as he tried teaming up with Monkey D. Luffy in the Prisoner Mine to work toward escaping and get more meal tickets. However, he was much less willing to help Luffy in his quest to take down Emperor Kaidou himself, and when he and the Straw Hats encountered a kraken on the way to Fish-Man Island, he begged for them to flee from it. When his pleading was unsuccessful, he gave the Straw Hats the idea to send fighters out in bubbles to keep the kraken from attacking their ship and dooming him. During his cover story, however, Caribou appeared to grow more conscientious of others. When a granny nursed him back to health, he was initially willing to let her be beaten by Scotch, but he had a change of heart and returned to the island with his crew to save her and the factory workers; this culminated in him protecting the granny from X Drake at all costs. Like many other characters, he has a distinct laughter style, starting with \"Kehihihi\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As co-captain of the Caribou Pirates, Caribou has authority over his crew alongside his brother Coribou. Caribou is a strong pirate, gaining Super Rookie status while successfully traversing Paradise, the first half of the Grand Line. With his Devil Fruit powers, he has become well-known as a menace to the Marines by killing many of them, allowing him to gain a 210,000,000 bounty. Caribou and his crew were able to easily round up the members of the Fake Straw Hat Crew aside from their captain, and they were powerless to stop Caribou. Additionally, he led his crew and freedom-fighting citizens to a swift victory against Scotch of the Beasts Pirates primarily by overwhelming the enemy with his Devil Fruit power. Along with his crew, Caribou also showed the ability to tame the large sea beast Momoo and get it to pull their ship down toward Fish-Man Island. When engaging in physical combat, Caribou relies almost solely on his Devil Fruit power and has no knowledge of Haki. His real body is not very durable, as he has frequently been defeated in one blow by opponents who can use Busoshoku Haki such as Luffy, Pekoms, Jinbe, and X Drake."},
{"name": "Capone Bege", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Bege is a short man with a stocky build whose appearance is somewhat similar to that of a Mafia boss. He sports an oiled-up and slicked-back hairstyle befitting that of a crime don. His facial features have a very stern look to them further accentuated by his rather sharp but hooking beak-like nose. He also has five o'clock stubble on his upper lip. He wears a black-and-white pinstriped attire, complete with a green scarf around his neck, with the excess tucked inside the suit (making it look like a cravat). Like Crocodile, Bege wears very expensive golden rings with precious stones mounted on them, but because Bege has two hands, all his fingers (including the thumbs) have them. As for his personal effects, he has a pirate captain's coat with red and gold trimming and a fedora hat, both of which he only seems to wear for traveling purposes. He is often seen smoking a cigar, except when eating. In an SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Bege is shown as a kid with a curlier hair and a shorter and rounder head. He wore a shirt and tie. He was also depicted as playing with guns, knives, and a fortress made of blocks, referencing his Devil Fruit abilities. After the timeskip, he grew a thick goatee and now wears a darker hat. During the Zou Arc, he sported a pair of sunglasses resembling those worn by Pekoms. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Bege wore a rose on the left breast of his suit, keeping it in subsequent appearances.", "personality": "Despite being a notorious pirate and a former mobster with a shady reputation, Bege cultivates a refined, sophisticated (yet still frightening) image that is rather appropriate to his mafia roots. He dresses himself in fine suits and enjoys fine dining while on board his ship at sea. He is strongly appalled by things like bad table manners and rudeness, usually maintaining a reserved and calm demeanor. Bege is very particular about cleanliness and hygiene, refusing to have a meeting with anyone who does not present themself properly, forcing even his enemies to do so. When meeting Sanji for the first time, he offered him food and drinks, in an apparent act of hospitality and politeness. For so long as he is not agitated, Bege appears to be a reasonable pirate who is willing to negotiate and prefers to avoid making a scene, with the intent of dodging unnecessary confrontations with enemies he may find inconvenient, such as an Admiral or a powerful warrior tribe. In spite of his apparent seriousness, Bege can be very impatient and ill-tempered, being not at all above injuring other people, even his own crew, should they provoke his ire even in the slightest. Though he may not always be inclined to fight, Bege is a fearless man who will not hesitate to confront someone should it prove beneficial or necessary, regardless of how strong they might be. His Devil Fruit plays a large role in that thanks to its defensive, strategic nature and reliance on sheer numbers. When Bege does engage in battle, he tends to just walk into danger on his own, since he can easily summon numerous subordinates at any time and place to fight on his behalf. Bege is extremely sadistic, bloodthirsty and is known for decapitating even animals simply for entertainment. He does not crave power himself, but rather aims to destabilize the factions in power and watch the resulting struggle for power for his own entertainment. Everywhere he goes, he takes out the leaders of the groups opposing him in order to achieve this, only caring for his opponents' treasure and the bloodshed he will see from them later. His enjoyment of chaos does not exclude that which is caused by someone other than himself. Bege hysterically laughed upon the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau and the potential fall of the Big Mom Pirates, showcasing how much he is amused by the demise of the mighty and powerful. Despite this bloodthirsty nature though, Bege does have some degree of mercy and self-control. According to Jinbe, while he slaughtered leaders of powerful organizations, he left their subordinates alone and only viciously retaliated when they attempted revenge. Bege can be very cunning and pragmatic, not being above taking hostages, bluffing, or shooting people in the back in order to accomplish his goals. Highly opportunistic, Bege is always on the lookout for a potential weakness or opening from the enemy, having no qualms in exploiting it to the maximum. His plan to assassinate Big Mom involved destroying a photo of Mother Carmel, a precious figure of her past, having observed and correctly deducted that she lost her usual incredible toughness while suffering from a mental breakdown caused by the photo being slightly damaged. Later, after he seemingly accepted Oven's demands to surrender for Chiffon's safety, he took a shot at Oven while the latter's guard was down. He also withheld information that his ship could travel on land with tank trends, enabling him to surprise the Big Mom Pirates while retrieving Chiffon and escape Cacao Island. While those moments may indicate that Bege is highly untrustworthy, he is noted by his wife, Chiffon, to always honor his deals and promises, regardless of the outcome of his schemes. In addition, Sanji has proved that it is possible for Bege to leave his pragmatism aside if he ends up convinced that an alternative can be just as successful, even if it may sound ridiculous in theory. Bege has occasionally shown a prideful side, bragging about the fact that he is also part of the Worst Generation, just like Luffy. While he has never shown a specific interest on fame or power, Bege holds his strategic plans in high regard and has the utmost faith in his own tactical wit. His proposals tend to be quite meticulous, making sure that every variable is accounted and possible setbacks are taken care of (although unpredictable wild cards like Luffy himself can still humorously catch him off guard). Despite his elaborate schemes, Bege never really boasts about the ingenuity or success rate of his plans, but he was still displeased upon reading an article that portrayed and credited Luffy as the mastermind behind Big Mom's failed assassination plot. After becoming a father and husband, Bege seems to have lessened his cruel and ruthless behavior to some extent. He is not above acting foolish in front of others to entertain his son and shows love towards his wife in various situations. Bege may also show appreciation towards his subordinates or outsiders that he has no hostile relationships with as long as they demonstrate enough competency. However, Bege does not like to be thought as a good person, finding disgust at the idea of people feeling gratefulness towards him. While Bege outwardly considers empathy towards others to be weakness and cowardliness, unbefitting of pirates, he has shown to deeply care for his family and crew, risking his own life against Big Mom if it meant protecting the few people that are close to him and refusing to abandon them.

After taking Nami and Chopper hostage while bargaining with Sanji and Brook at Zou, he knew that Caesar was hiding nearby, while Sanji and Brook were completely unaware of the presence of the three. In addition, Bege has a strong will since he did not lose consciousness when Big Mom released a wave of Haoshoku Haki upon focusing on the broken picture of Mother Carmel, an event which caused many of the people present to faint."},

{"name": "Camie", "episode": "Episode 195", "chapter": "Chapter 385", "year": 2001, "note": "She was formally introduced in Chapter 490.", "appearance": "Camie is a young kissing gourami mermaid, and as a reference to the type of fish she is, she always expresses a very distinct face-fault whenever she is shocked by something. Whenever she expresses shock, her eyes typically pops out as commonly seen in manga and anime. Her face-fault is always shown with a very wide open mouth that shows her teeth and her tongue is usually seen sticking out in an up and down, zigzag manner. In the anime, she is shown with green hair and dark purple eyes. When she first met the Straw Hats, she wore a yellow and pink t-shirt that exposed her stomach and she wore an orange backpack where she carried her takoyaki. Camie has a pink tail with light fins, and her dorsal fin is white. Previously, her only color depiction came from the Ocean's Dream! - Oceans of Dreams game in which she had blue hair and a yellow tail. Because of Oda's change in style since he first drew her, Camie has had a few changes in appearance. The first is an addition of a dorsal fin along her spine. While Camie's overall appearance has not changed much after the two-year timeskip, she appears more feminine. Her mermaid fish tail is generally longer and slimmer and her caudal fin is now larger and more curvy. Her hair, rather than being parted down the middle, is parted to her right and is dyed. She now wears a spaghetti-strap top with a jagged lower hem that exposes her stomach instead of a t-shirt, but still from Pappag's Criminal brand. She also wears a necklace with beads and a bracelet on her right wrist shaped like flowers. In the anime, Camie's hair has become a brighter shade of green.", "personality": "Camie has a habit of being easily shocked. Anything from a simple mistake, to a large shocking situation makes her shocked to a degree greater than any other normal person would be. Camie and her starfish, Pappag, also have the most unfortunate luck of getting eaten by large sea kings almost every time they go out. By the time she first met the Straw Hats, she had been swallowed twenty times. Camie also has the unfortunate luck of getting captured almost every time she goes out, though it is likely because she is so nave and gullible. Before she was captured by Macro and his crew once again in the Flying Fish Rider's base, she had been previously captured by the Fish-Man Pirates thirty times. Fortunately for her, somebody is usually around to save her. Since the first time meeting him, this has usually been Hatchan. Camie has a habit of referring to humans in a unique way. Instead of simply saying human and humans, she says human person and human people respectively. She also tends to address others with the suffix \"Chin\" added to their names in a similar fashion as how \"San\" and \"Chan\" are used in Japanese to address others. She would thus address Luffy as Luffy-chin, Nami as Nami-chin, Hatchan as Hatchin, and so on. While Camie is currently working part-time at the Mermaid Cafe and for Hatchan's Takoyaki business, she dreams of becoming a famous fashion designer like her master, Pappag. As said before, she is nave and gullible, but she is also very kind, caring, and open-hearted and due to her navet she has no problem with trusting strangers, such as the Straw Hat Pirates when she just met them. In situations with a sexual or relationship-like nature, she is either very shy and misunderstanding or just unknowing, such as when she blushed when Shakky asked if she was Hatchan's girlfriend and when she did not understand how she gave Sanji a nosebleed by putting his head between her breasts. Two years later, while not having completely lost her navet and quirks, she appears more thoughtful, mature and independent, as she now lives on her own without Hatchan or Pappag. She acts as Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp's sensible guide to Fish-Man Island and actually was quick to take charge of the group when Sanji got in trouble by losing a lot of blood.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a mermaid, Camie has several abilities unique to her race. She has the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is apparently only audible to them. Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the Flying Fish Riders. However, like any mermaid, she is vulnerable on land."},

{"name": "Caesar Clown", "episode": "Episode 658", "chapter": "Chapter 581", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 663.", "appearance": "Caesar has a very gaseous look due to his Devil Fruit ability. He has very long, spiky, black hair, brown eyes (yellow in the anime), and two curly horns growing from the back of his head. He is rather tall (shown to be about the same height as Brook when standing next to him with his gas powers deactivated), and wears purple lipstick and dark makeup on his eyes. He has a small flat nose and long thin eyebrows. His arms are very thin in comparison with the rest of his body. Caesar wears a big light blue colored coat with \"GAS\" printed in pink on each side (in his first appearances this was not present). Under his coat, he wears a pair of diagonally-striped yellow overalls which are striped cross with orange lines. The overall is cut off right under his knees, exposing his hairy legs. He also wears dark purple gloves with the initials \"CC\" in white on them. Due to his constant gaseous form, he seems to not use shoes, remaining barefoot, though only when his powers were disabled, his feet solidified with the rest of his body along with a simple pair of shoes. Four years before his debut, Caesar had shorter hair that was more rounded, and wore a polka dot patterned shirt beneath his coat. Over two decades ago Caesar had bowl cut hair style. During his third fight with Luffy, Luffy greatly damaged Caesar's face, which knocked some of his teeth out and bent his facial structure inwards, and seemingly breaking his nose. As a result, his pronunciation became a bit hard to understand. After absorbing the Shinokuni, Caesar's entire body structure changed to a darker gas color matching that of the gas, becoming as comparably large as a giant, with his hair growing completely wild and overly long. He also grows a coral-shaped crown behind his horns. The word in kanji \"Land of Death\" (?) is written on the front of his chest. Upon his defeat, he returns to normal. When under the service of Capone Bege, he disguised himself by wearing a blue shirt with an aqua scarf and suspenders while donning a spiky hairstyle that covered his horns. While part of the Sanji Retrieval Team-Fire Tank Pirates Alliance, he wore a yellow suit. In the anime, Caesar's skin tone is shown to be a pale white, while in the manga it is shown as a more natural tone.", "personality": "A cruel, arrogant, scheming, sinister, and an overall very evil person, Caesar takes great delight in causing harm and destruction to anything and anybody around him. His psychopathic nature is displayed many times, such as when he set off a chemical weapon on Punk Hazard, killing or crippling most of its inhabitants and destroying its environment, selling or creating weapons of mass destruction for similarly unscrupulous individuals such as Doflamingo, performing sick experiments on children and drugging them with a lethal, addictive drug to ensure that they do not run away, and trying to murder everyone on Punk Hazard (Trafalgar Law, the Straw Hats, Smoker's Marines, the children, and his own blindly following minions) so he could test out his new poisonous gas weapon-pet, Smileyall of which he does without a shred of remorse or empathy for his potential victims. He also demonstrates tendencies of egomania when Luffy mentioned his Gasu Gasu no Mi had no effect on his immune system due to Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi, both being poisonous Devil Fruits of differentiating class, causing Caesar to become rapidly aggravated from the fact that Luffy compared his Logia powers to that of a \"mere\" Paramecia user. He was very surprised that his poisons did not affect Luffy due to the latter's immunity to poison given to him from his near-death poisoning by Magellan.Caesar takes utmost pride in the biological weapons he created. Proudof the unexpected power of his Koro gas weapon, he was rather unhappy when the Straw Hat Pirates forced him to counter it to save the poisoned Mink Tribe.He was extremely excited when the Fire Tank Pirates used his KX Launchers in their attempt to assassinate Big Mom and was frustrated when the Emperor easily destroyed his weapons simply by screaming. He has shown to have maniacal tendencies due to his sedulous research on weapons of mass destruction and his absence of emotion at the time of murdering people or provoking any type of suffering such as giving drugs to the children so they would suffer severe withdrawal and return to his research facility for more \"candies\" filled with the stimulant, and showing no regret or sorrow for his actions. He is also very sadistic, as he exploited the blind trust of his wounded subordinates to test a newly developed gas and ordered the Yeti Cool Brothers to assassinate Brownbeard when he thought he was no use to him anymore: he further provoked a partially-paralyzed Brownbeard by revealing the truth about the gas explosion four years ago, in order to create an opportunity to have his subordinates shoot him down. He also used the restricted drug NHC10 to maintain his control of the children he kidnapped, knowing that they will be unable to escape due to the agonizing withdrawal symptoms, and that by his own calculations, they will die in five years after he started his experiments with them, which he deems a necessary sacrifice for his science. Law found this aspect of Caesar disgusting. Caesar also seems to enjoy cocktails, as he is often seen holding a cocktail glass. He appears to have a grudge against Vegapunk, as well as a cautious disposition, as shown when he hid from the Marines instead of trying to engage them immediately, as well as trusting Monet's deduction that the Straw Hats might be more powerful than their bounties claim, and waiting for Joker's approval to make his actions look like accidents, before starting attacks. Caesar is also a rather economizing person, as he did not want to waste the poison by clearing it off, but rather, collected, saved and compressed it into Smiley. He also appears to be able to act or lie on several occasions, often being seen feigning emotions when lying to his subordinates and to the children, a trait that was quickly noted by Monet when he attempted to show false concern for his subordinates facing Smiley. However, with the blind trust of his subordinates and some crocodile tears, he was able to deceive them easily, leading them to believe that Vegapunk was responsible for the Punk Hazard explosion four years ago. Caesar also is very ill-tempered and quick to anger when things do not go his way, such as yelling at his subordinates to let the gas come in to kill the intruders and his own men and again when Monet pointed out that Vergo would die and Caesar just yelled, unconcerned about his potential disloyalty. Upon losing the upper hand against Luffy during their last fight, Caesar lost his composure and ordered his subordinates to let in the Shinokuni gas, while outwardly exclaiming that they can easily be replaced. He then goes as far as personally killing the ones present simply to test out his newly acquired power, revealing his true colors in the process. He is a very prideful person, going as far to say that his work four years ago on the weapon that caused the Punk Hazard incident was not a failure, but instead was a great success, implying a superiority complex. Due to his pride in his own work, he tends to blush when his work is praised, even by the enemy, but turned to indignity when that praise turned towards Vegapunk. He was also shocked to see Smiley not listening to him and eat the candy despite Caesar saying to wait and Caesar said it was alright while Monet noted he was not listening to him. Despite his pride, Caesar is capable of knowing when a task is beyond his capabilities, as when Big Mom commissioned him to turn her family into giants, Caesar knew that the task was impossible despite his own view of himself. He also does not take kindly to insults, as when Law called him stupid, Caesar lashes out by punching Law's heart. Similarly, when Bege called him an idiot, Caesar angrily corrected Bege by saying he is a genius. Unlike most Logia users, Caesar keeps his Devil Fruit ability activated all the time and is either completely or partly turned into gas. Caesar has an odd habit of being easily shocked by things that leave him dumbfounded, often doing a comical face-fault, such as when Luffy survived his second Gastanet attack and appeared behind him unharmed. He did so again when Luffy was about to attack him from behind in their second fight together, which seems to be a running gag on his part. Upon Luffy declaring that he does not want to see Caesar's face anymore out of anger, the scientist cried in fear right before he was sent flying by Luffy's Gear 3 attack. Caesar is also very cowardly when his life is threatened in any way. When he was about to lose to Luffy he attempted to beg the Straw Hat captain to spare him and even make him his subordinate. He also repeatedly begged Doflamingo to save him and even later begged the Straw Hats to protect him from Big Mom on more than one occasion. While Caesar does at least attempt to fulfill commissions made by other people, he is not averse to giving up on them and will abuse his money and privileges on a hedonistic lifestyle of women and alcohol instead, especially if the projects given to him are proven to be too difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish (i.e. gigantification). He would even continue to lie to his investor in order to embezzle more money for such purposes. When he was under Doflamingo's protection, Caesar did not care about what he did to other people because he viewed himself as safe from them, even from that of an Emperor. Upon losing Doflamingo to the Marines, however, Caesar came to fear the consequences, especially since one of his clienteles is none other than Charlotte Linlin, one of the Four Emperors, and he became desperate with lies and thoughts of escaping, even admitting (to himself) that the given project was outright beyond his own limits (which he normally was so arrogant about). However, Caesar's prideful and arrogant attitude can at the very least be scratched, as he started crying in anger when Nami and Chopper referred to him as \"human scum\" and \"the worst\" during the operation to ruin Big Mom's Tea Party. He has a distinct laugh of \"Shurororororo\" (Shuhohoho in Viz media translation).", "abilities_and_powers": "Caesar has authority over all the former test subjects on the island as he saved them from the gas, and he uses their blind-trust to manipulate them. However, after Caesar revealed that he does not care about his subordinates, he lost their faith. Caesar is also shown to be highly crafty and cunning, easily facilitating an escape from a Marine battleship escort after he was arrested and then returning to Punk Hazard, as well as ensuring that his affiliate Trafalgar Law would not renege on their partnership by having him use his own \"Ope Ope no Mi\" to remove his heart and place it in Caesar's safekeeping in exchange for allowing him to stay on Punk Hazard (while also demonstrating an act of goodwill by allowing Law to take the heart of Caesar's secretary Monet himself). This reveals the level of caution Caesar has around other individuals of comparable or greater power than himself. He is also very aware of the consequences of murdering Vice-Admiral Smoker and his G-5 Marines on site. He also was able to escape when he was captured and kept himself hidden for a long while. He also purposely enraged a partially paralyzed Brownbeard in order to prevent the subordinates present from suspecting him, and have them shoot down Brownbeard without being the wiser. Despite Caesar's cowardly behavior, he has a strong will being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Buggy", "episode": "Episode 9", "chapter": "Chapter 4", "year": 1997, "note": "He was first mentioned by the Tightrope Walking Funan Bros in Chapter 8.", "appearance": "Buggy is a slim blue-haired man with an appearance resembling that of a clown, as to mirror his epithet. The big, red nose on his face is, in fact, his real nose. Buggy's face is always covered with makeup, just like a clown, and the motifs change from time to time: in his first appearance he had crossbones going down his face forming an X; he also had two blue lines near both of his eyes, red lipstick and his jolly roger on his hat. However, in later episodes after the Loguetown Arc his look changes. First, a green star appears in the middle of the forehead, two half circles appear beneath the eyes, and there is a straight line on the middle of his chin. After that (when his crew meets Ace), he has two green dots on both sides of his head and four big green dots on the rim of his hat, which still has the jolly roger on it. He also has green eyeliner and green lipstick, with a curvy line going down both sides of his face. In the Impel Down saga, he has crossbones again going down his forehead to below his eyes, two pink lines pointing up, and red lipstick. In his pirate captain attire, he dons a striped white and red shirt with short sleeves, white gloves reminiscent of the ones worn by clowns, a sash around his waist like many other pirates, and a pair of loose pants reaching to his calves, just above a pair of striped socks and pointy shoes. He also has a scarf around his neck. Hanging from his shoulders there is an orange, fur-lined captain's coat. On his head he has an orange hat with his jolly roger on it, over a neckerchief with the same pattern of his shirt. While in the manga his scarf and sash are orange just like many other components of his attire, his pants are light-brown and the epaulets of his coat are simply gold, in the anime he was given a much brighter color scheme, with a purple scarf, green sash, light-green pants, and green epaulets. In Impel Down, he wore a striped prisoner outfit and wore his hair in a ponytail. After escaping from the Grand Prison, he changed his prisoner uniform with clothes like the one he normally wears, with salvaged Marine uniform pieces to recreate the effects of a pirate captain: a white coat and a white tricorn that had the Marine symbols crossed out. As a young man serving aboard Gol D. Roger's ship, he looked mostly the same; the only notable differences were his shorter hair and smaller stature. He wore a different outfit in each flashback but dressed similarly to how he does now, usually seen in striped T-shirts (or collared shirts), white gloves, baggy pants, pointed shoes, and donning a sash. He wore beanies rather than a captain's hat and he lacked the captain's coat. It was revealed in an SBS Volume 4 question that the blue tassels coming from the sides of Buggy's hat are his actual hair in the shape of two ponytails. While in the confines of Impel Down, Buggy's long hair is tied into just one ponytail. After the timeskip, Buggy's appearance has changed greatly. His hair is not tied anymore and now looks spikier. He wears a big red and white, striped tricorn with a rim ornated with several golden little balls and his crew's Jolly Roger on the front. He wears a big, red cloak, using his Devil Fruit powers to make himself appear larger.", "personality": "Buggy is very vain and egotistical and seeks to be glorified and feared by others. When he was nine years old, he complained that the Whitebeard Pirates were receiving more attention in the newspaper than his crew, the Roger Pirates. He does not spend much of his time improving his own abilities to become a powerful fighter, but rather focuses mainly on recruiting powerful subordinates who do the hard work while simultaneously being subjected to him. If presented with an opportunity to make himself look good and recruit powerful followers, Buggy will take it. Whenever someone strokes his ego, even if it is due to an inaccurate impression of him, Buggy will revel in it and start getting delusions of grandeur; when the Impel Down escapees praised him for being on Roger's crew, Buggy started considering that their support could help him take down Whitebeard or even become the Pirate King. Buggy is a showman, and his actions are frequently designed to bring attention to himself. He injects the word \"flashy\" (, hade ni?), into almost every sentence he speaks (\"Flashily die! You flashy bastard!\"), and frequently uses it to describe his actions, such as giving Monkey D. Luffy a \"flashy execution\" in Loguetown. In that attempted execution, he made his entrance by blowing up a fountain, and allowed his crew to run wild while he executed Luffy atop the platform where Gol D. Roger was famously killed. During the Summit War of Marineford, he had his followers broadcast his exploits to the outside world with a stolen Den Den Mushi, and after becoming a Warlord of the Sea during the timeskip, he uses his Devil Fruit abilities in conjunction with a large robe to make himself look much bigger than he actually is. In addition to wanting followers, Buggy loves to find treasure and spends most of his time following maps leading to great riches; when he was on the Roger Pirates, he stated that the most important thing to a pirate is the physical treasure they find. Buggy is extremely possessive over the treasure he takes and will kill anyone who attempts to steal from him. When Shanks accidentally caused him to lose a treasure map during their apprentice days, Buggy developed a grudge against him that has lasted for three decades. When the Roger Pirates went to Skypiea, Buggy was very attracted to the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell and was disappointed when Roger decided not to take it. Buggy was even willing to guide Luffy through Impel Down in exchange for an armband pointing to Captain John's treasure, though did not intend to fully honor the deal especially after Luffy gave him the armband in advance. When asked by Shanks on Marineford to return Luffy's straw hat, Buggy immediately did so upon being promised a treasure map in return and was extremely angry when he found out Shanks was lying. Buggy is extremely prideful; when he failed to kill Luffy, Zoro, and Nami for stealing from him and defying him, he said that it would bring great shame upon him and his crew to let them go free. After Luffy defeated him, Buggy made it his mission to hunt down and kill him for simply angering him. He is prone to underestimating opponents that he knows nothing about, as he initially mistook Luffy for a common thief and believed that Luffy was much weaker than him until being defeated by him; he initially paid much more attention to Zoro due to having heard of the swordsman before. In Impel Down, Buggy's lack of knowledge about vice warden Hannyabal caused him to assume that he and Galdino had a chance of beating him, causing them to attack him and get easily beaten. Buggy also angrily confronted Portgas D. Ace as an enemy until finding out who he was. When the Roger Pirates battled the Whitebeard Pirates for four days, Marco noted that Buggy and Shanks both had impressively stoic attitudes for young pirate apprentices. Buggy is extremely sensitive about his big red nose and will immediately execute anyone who points it out, usually by blowing them up with a Buggy Ball. He frequently tends to mishear people as talking about his nose when in reality they are talking about something completely different, and sometimes he even mistakes his own speech as referring to his nose and gets angry at people around him for it. Despite his prideful and vain attitude, Buggy is aware of the many dangers of the Grand Line and typically does not commit rash actions that would put him in trouble, to the point of acting cowardly. When the Roger Pirates came into conflict with the Golden Lion Pirates and their massive fleet, a 12-year-old Buggy worriedly pleaded for Roger to comply with Golden Lion captain Shiki's request. When Ace fell asleep on his ship, Buggy ordered his crew not to kill him as he knew that doing so would unleash Whitebeard's wrath on them. When teaming up with Luffy, who wanted to go to the lowest level of Impel Down to save Ace, Buggy wished to stay on the highest level possible and avoid the prison's powerful guards. When escaping from Impel Down, Buggy went along with Jinbe, Crocodile, and Daz Bonez to commandeer a Marine ship in order to stay away from the warden Magellan. When he witnessed Whitebeard die after battling the Marine admirals and Blackbeard Pirates, Buggy immediately became afraid and flew away from the battleground, not caring if his followers saw him as cowardly. However, Buggy may commit rash actions if compelled by his emotions; when Dracule Mihawk sliced him into many pieces during the Summit War of Marineford, Buggy got angry at him and shot a Muggy Ball at him without thinking, causing Mihawk to deflect it back at him. When Crocodile and Mihawk confronted him for his unintentional usurpation of presidency of the Cross Guild, he showed tremendous cowardice by crying and pleading for mercy, even offering to lick their shoes clean, and upon being made figurehead leader under the two superior pirates, he became worried for his future. Buggy can often be cruel and selfish, even toward his comrades. While operating in the East Blue, he regularly raided and pillaged defenseless towns before destroying them as he pleased and would kill anyone who opposed him without hesitation. If one of his subordinates fails to accomplish a task, Buggy will become very angry at them and may abuse them. When a Buggy Ball was flying toward him and his crew, Buggy used two of his crewmates as shields without any remorse. After losing his Warlord position and being confronted by a Marine fleet, Buggy plotted to escape in secret while the rest of his forces fought the Marines. When teaming up with Luffy in Impel Down, Buggy frequently looked for ways to split away from him and pursue his own goal of escaping, even if it meant going back on his word or leaving Luffy in a perilous situation. When Luffy gave him Captain John's armband in advance and let him go off even before they had agreed to, Buggy was baffled by his kindness. While with the Roger Pirates, he kept a treasure map from them without telling anyone and pretended to eat the Devil Fruit the crew had in order to sell the real one, valuing gaining wealth for himself over contributing to the crew. Buggy is willing to do whatever it takes to win and aid his comrades in battle, as shown when he attempted to restrain Zoro to allow Cabaji to strike him. Although, despite his cowardness he ultimately spoke up against Crocodile's goal and criticized him deeming it not a way a pirate should go and wishing to achieve his desire go to the top and become Pirate King after learning Shanks had finally joined the race for the One Piece, something that both Crocodile and Mihawk found extremely delusional although Buggy intended to do so by taking the One Piece first rather than fight for it. Buggy appears to love eating and drinking, as he frequently engages in parties and banquets with his crew. When he was in Level 4 of Impel Down, he wanted to go with Luffy to break into the kitchen, and Galdino was forced to stop him from heading into an obvious ambush.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Buggy Pirates, Buggy has authority over his crew, which grew exponentially during the Impel Down Arc after he freed hundreds of powerful prisoners from Impel Down whose individual bounties are much higher than his own. After hearing that Buggy was once a member of the Roger Pirates, these prisoners came to heavily respect him and follow him wherever he went. The Emperor, Edward Newgate even noted that Buggy's new forces could disrupt his crew's ability to save Portgas D. Ace if they were against him, so he offered to form an alliance with Buggy during the Summit War of Marineford. Buggy's newfound authority created by his association with the Roger Pirates even attracted the attention of the World Government, who offered him a Warlord position. Buggy used this position to run a Mercenary business called Buggy's Delivery, where he had authority over a large number of powerful mercenaries including giants from Elbaf. However, now that the Seven Warlords System has been dissolved, Buggy returned to being an enemy, meaning he can no longer operate outside of the law as he pleases. Because of his alliance with Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile, in the form of Cross Guild, under his \"supposed\" leadership, Buggy became recognized as one of the Four Emperors and earned a bounty of 3,189,000,000. However, despite his high bounty and once being an apprentice with the renowned Roger Pirates, Buggy has never achieved the great strength and combat skills of his crewmates, particularly his fellow former apprentice and emperor Shanks. In fact, physically speaking and combat wise Buggy is relatively weak compared to most of the pirates operating in the New World. It is safe to say that the only reason he survived for as long as he did is because of his lies and manipulations and several misinterpretations of him with only a few people seeing though the ruse either for their high intelligence or because they know Buggy well enough to see the truth. For the most part, he is only truly dangerous against normal citizens and novice pirates in the weakest sea East Blue, though did manage to easily defeat the Kumate Tribe with the help of Alvida, Mohji, and Cabaji. However, Buggy is resilient, having sailed the Grand Line with the Roger Pirates and surviving the battles and perils they were in, including fights against opponents like the Golden Lion Pirates and Whitebeard Pirates. Buggy has also captained his own crew through the Grand Line and has survived its perils so far, and currently operates in the New World. Buggy was involved in the mass breakout of Impel Down and the Summit War of Marineford and survived, although he was rarely involved in direct combat and most of the fighters paid him little mind. Buggy mainly gets by with his craftiness; he frequently devises plans to unexpectedly overwhelm his opponents with his weapons and Devil Fruit. He allowed Roronoa Zoro to cut him into pieces and pretended to be dead in order to stab Zoro with a detached hand while he was off-guard. He was also able to trap Luffy on Gol D. Roger's execution platform and would have successfully executed him had lightning not struck the platform. Buggy is also a skilled inventor, as evidenced by his creation of extremely powerful ammunition like Buggy Balls and Muggy Balls that greatly aid in his destructive capabilities. While alone on an unknown island, he made a trap to attempt to catch a large bird, but the bird was not fooled. Additionally, Buggy is very opportunistic, and will frequently look to utilize other people to help him get out of trouble. This was most notably shown in Impel Down, where he freed hundreds of prisoners to get them to follow him and create a riot. When the Marines identified him as a former member of the Roger Pirates, Buggy decided to quickly utilize this to build up his own image. Although his efforts to be seen as great are frequently intentional, Buggy also benefited from a significant amount of luck when leading the Impel Down escapees, as even though he showed his cowardly nature multiple times, his words and actions were always misconstrued by the escapees as indicators of strength."},

His dark hair is arranged in a propeller-like formation; the hair on top of his head extending straight up, a pair of sideburns extended outward to the sides, and a long goatee, and though his hairdo may seem deliberately styled this way, the hairs which stick out are actually cowlicks. Initially, he was seen with several cowlicks in the shape of a turbine formation, but was later seen with just four in the shape of a more traditional propeller. He has protruding teeth where his crew's Jolly Roger is depicted. He wears a yellow fur coat and wraps thick chains around his body, and is seen wearing a pair of strange-shaped boots. At 14 years old, Buffalo already possessed a large physique for his age and slight buckteeth. His hair was arranged into two antennae and he wore a beanie. At age 20, Buffalo's buckteeth did not yet carry the crew's symbol, and his hair was organized in more of a clover-petals formation, similar to the shape of a ship propeller. His clothes were darker in color than his current attire.", "personality": "Buffalo is very loyal to his \"family\", being perfectly fine with that fact that Donquixote Doflamingo destroyed eight cities and all the people living there, simply for the sake of keeping Baby 5 away from her \"boyfriends\". Buffalo also protested against Law's betrayal, assuring that Doflamingo had reserved the \"Corazon throne\" for him. He follows the crew's blood law very seriously, as when seeing Trafalgar Law stabbing Corazon, Buffalo immediately decided to tell Doflamingo about it; he flew into a rage when Kyros decapitated a string clone of Doflamingo, believing that gladiator has killed the real \"young master\". During his childhood, Buffalo was something of a prankster, playing tricks on the ever-clumsy Corazon and getting a chuckle at the officer's expense, despite being struck across the face in return. He also once laughed at Pica's voice, which resulted in torture as punishment. However, typical for a sweet-loving child, he was easily bribed when Law gave him some ice cream in exchange for his silence about stabbing Corazon. He seems to be a compulsive gambler, and enjoys gambling as he asked Baby 5 for a loan of 2,000,000, despite just teasing asking her how high in debt she is, so he can take it to the casino after their mission. He apparently does not approve of cheaters, as a group of scammers swindling a blind man in Acacia were noted to only have been doing so because of Buffalo's absence. Despite his aloof and greedy personality, he also seems to be very enthusiastic, as he is almost always seen smiling. He also has a habit of saying \"nnnniin\" during his sentences, to imitate the sound of a propeller.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Buffalo held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He appears to be a competent fighter as Doflamingo sent him, along with Baby 5, to Punk Hazard, despite knowing what the Straw Hats were up to. He has been partnered with Baby 5, and the two of them use their abilities in conjuncture with each other to make powerful combinations. The two were already capable members of the crew in their childhoods, whereas as much as 100 recruits had left after two days, tops, from inability to keep up with the training regimen.

{"name": "Borsalino", "episode": "Episode 504", "chapter": "Chapter 398", "year": 2008, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nico Robin in Chapter 319. His real name was revealed in Chapter 507.

He is of middle age with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face, short curly black hair, and a very thin beard. He is older than the other two admirals, a fact that is reflected in his looks. Kizaru's standard outfit consists of a yellow striped suit with a Marine coat draped over his shoulders like a cape, with his arms not in its sleeves. Kizaru also wears pure white shoes, gold-amber tinted sunglasses, and a dark green shirt with a mauve tie under his yellow suit. There is a tiny Black Den Den Mushi on his left wrist, like a wristwatch, underneath the sleeve of his suit. He is generally seen wearing a relaxed grin on his face. As a child, he wore a large yellow striped hat, much like his older self's suit, a yellow vest and he still had his grin that he maintained throughout his life. In his early days as a Marine, he wore a knit cap with the Marine emblem on it, sunglasses, and also a normal Marine jacket with a striped undershirt. In his youth, he wore a Marine skull cap and had no facial hair. Twenty-seven years before the start of the series, he wore a typical Marine cap, and his beard was not as full as it is currently. He also lacked the gold amber-tinted sunglasses, shirt, and tie, which he was last seen wearing. When he was seen stationed at Marineford as a vice admiral thirteen years before the start of the series, he was sporting a large dark grey hat, dark gloves and had a cigarette in his mouth. His trademark pinstriped suit was light grey, matching his tie, while his thin beard was not yet present. For a time, his appearance after the timeskip in the anime deviated from that in the manga, as his character reappeared in the anime before being reintroduced in the manga, where he was given a different design than what Eiichiro Oda eventually decided to use for the manga. In One Piece Film: Z, he was shown wearing a different pinstripe suit, and instead of a collared shirt and tie, had on a viridian green turtleneck. The appearance he had here was also seen on his half-completed wax likeness made by Diego in Episode of Luffy and used for One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2 and One Piece: Unlimited World Red. This served as his acting post-timeskip appearance, until he made his first actual appearance after the timeskip in the manga in Chapter 802, which saw him in a pinstripe suit similar to the one shown for his anime appearances, but not entirely sharing the same design, nor was it the one he had worn before the timeskip. He also continued wearing a collared shirt and tie instead of a turtleneck.", "personality": "Kizaru comes off as perpetually calm, equable, easygoing, and taking most things lightly no matter the severity of the situation. He talks in a calm voice suiting this demeanor: in a slow, sarcastically intonated manner with the last syllable of a sentence often drawn out  usually the sentence-final particles \"ne\" (?) or \"yo\" (?) for emphatic effect. He is prone to beginning sentences with a stressed \"ooh\", such as when observing something surprising or that piques his interest. Still, despite such laxity, Kizaru's register is quite formal (compared to Aokiji's more colloquial or Akainu's rougher, more derogatory speech patterns), using the polite \"desu/masu\" and taking care to address certain people with an honorific (such as his superior or even a pirate of high status); his first-person pronoun is \"wasshi\" (?), indicating his older age. With an ever-relaxed air in or out of combat, Kizaru is almost never shown losing his cool, raising his voice, or getting excited to prompt action. With his Logia intangibility, he can afford remaining apathetic to most enemy attempts to harm him, paying extremely sudden or surprisingly potent attacks little to no mind if they come from much weaker opposition, to the point of not visibly reacting at all when shot in the head. This attitude of the admiral often lapses into absentmindedness, if not outright carelessness, that has him do things like repeatedly speak into a black Den Den Mushi meant not for talk but wiretapping (which had been explained to him multiple times) or politely ask fleeing pirates who had just shot at him if they might help him find his acquaintance. Kizaru has also been shown irresponsibly using his abilities with no regard for collateral damage, acting oblivious to the mass destruction that he threatens to bring on; this is seen when he caused a Yarukiman Mangrove on Sabaody to fall on self-admitted accident, then simply brushed it off. Additionally, Kizaru's casual attitude about whatever occurs around him may give way to the man leaving himself open to unsuspecting assault, such as watching his opponents unleash attacks without readying himself. Kizaru has been seen mid-battle remarking that it is \"scary\" or \"shocking\" when encountering someone powerful, bold, or who unleashes a surprising ability; however, he typically retains a nonchalant face and tone, making him sound facetious. In fact, Kizaru has acted fearlessly around the strongest of pirates, like Silvers Rayleigh, Benn Beckman, Marco, or even Whitebeard, an Emperor. While acknowledging their strength, Kizaru has no issue with battling them one-on-one and, should they get in his way, will simply attempt to circumvent them. After Shanks came to Marineford to end the war, Kizaru tried one last attack on Monkey D. Luffy right after Beckman had held him at gunpoint just to prevent him from so doing. Two years later, the admiral volunteered to personally go break up a potential meeting between Emperors Big Mom and Kaidou, which would have entailed going to the independent Wano Country of which even Akainu was wary at the time. Later, Kizaru elected to lead a fleet of warships to Egghead to prevent Vegapunk from being rescued from the island by the Straw Hats, despite knowing that Luffy had become an Emperor after defeating Kaidou. In battle, Kizaru can be condescending towards those he deems weak, mocking them or those associated with them. During the Marineford War, he initially went out of his way to strike down Luffy, seeking to illustrate their gap in strength. He would go on to viciously reproach Luffy for his inadequacy and denigrated Whitebeard for rallying behind the weaker pirate. Despite his high rank, Kizaru is not much a leader and prefers to follow orders, even if they come from subordinates (provided that they are close to him). Carrying out justice at his own pace and in a noncommittal way, his motto is \"Unclear Justice\" (, Dotchitsukazu no Seigi?, VIZ: \"Uncertain Justice\"), seemingly representing the gray area between Moral and Absolute Justice to allow Kizaru to operate with greater freedom. By his own admission, the admiral considers himself like a \"cog in a machine\" who simply acts as ordered, allowing him to shuffle off personal responsibility and justify certain actions on his part (like eliminating a once-close colleague like Vegapunk) as just him following orders. Indeed, with no qualms about carrying out any orders given to him, Kizaru has acted more callous than the highly moral-bound Aokiji and Fujitora, yet does not go out of his way to achieve justice to as thorough an extent as extremists like Akainu and Ryokugyu. In general, Kizaru seems inclined towards missions that do not require significant work, as he went to deal with the issue on Sabaody due to expecting it to be over quickly and became annoyed when Rayleigh interfered. The admiral may shift objectives on a whimsical basis, as seen on Sabaody when he went from initially looking for Sentomaru (per the original goal of his mission, detaining the Straw Hats) to then committing to an unrelated fight with four Supernovas, yet after defeating them simply disregarded their capture upon being given a new instruction. Regardless, Kizaru acts disdainful toward pirates on a default basis and will not show them mercy; he saw the Seven Warlords of the Sea as no more than pirates and claimed that a man like Rayleigh, despite having retired from piracy over 20 years earlier, could never see his crimes forgiven as a someone formerly of the Roger Pirates. After failing to capture Luffy on Sabaody, Kizaru instead went ahead with capturing 500 other pirates, showing that he may sway between either a more thorough or a more remissive execution of justice. Yet, despite Kizaru's unconcern for most things to do with his profession, he does seem to harbor a degree of honor in battle, though it may be reserved for opponents whom he respects or can claim closeness to, as he showed no such inclinations towards pirates. When Saint Saturn suggested the admiral simply bypass Sentomaru on Egghead instead of engaging him, Kizaru said that he could not do so since, with his old friend dedicated to making his stand against him, he felt that he had to honor this resolution and fight him directly. Still, Kizaru took down Sentomaru without reservations.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Kizaru ranks second only to Fleet Admiral Sakazuki (formerly Sengoku) in the Marines, holding power over the many thousands of junior personnel. His authority entails commanding fleets, having sway on the overall strategy of headquarters, and issuing special-purpose orders like a Buster Call to destroy any island he judges a threat, or temporarily passing on to others such privileges. The admiral being able to exercise these authorities duly and efficiently bespeaks a great deal of military leadership and coordination skills on his part. Even as a vice admiral twelve years ago, Kizaru was already a powerful combatant, enough to effortlessly defeat Arlong, one of the premier members of the Sun Pirates. Since his promotion to admiral, Kizaru has come to be crowned the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\" alongside his two admiral peers, thus being recognized as one of the world's most powerful people. Kizaru's mere presence on the Sabaody Archipelago was enough to cause a mass panic, inducing its pirate population (including most of the Supernovas present at the time) to flee. While on the island, Kizaru was able to overwhelm four of said SupernovasBasil Hawkins, Urouge, X Drake, and Scratchmen Apoowith minimal effort, individually defeating each of them with single attacks after they had failed to do anything against him (sans Apoo with two invisible surprise attacks that, nonetheless, proved completely ineffectual at hurting the admiral). Thereafter, Kizaru entered into one-on-one sword combat with an old Silvers Rayleigh, the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\". Though Rayleigh held the admiral's entire focus by Kizaru's own admission, the elder pirate eventually grew tired while Kizaru did not thanks to his younger age compared to the enemy, and both men emerged from the fight in conjecturally fine condition (with Kizaru only suffering a small cut on his cheek). Kizaru would then go on, before leaving Sabaody, to capture a total of 500 pirates. The Summit War saw Kizaru fighting, if only briefly, several of Whitebeard's division commanders on equal footing, including the Emperor's \"right hand\" Marco, and later against Whitebeard himself, whom he was able to seriously injure; Whitebeard and Marco were the only pirates to prompt the admiral to fight somewhat seriously. Also, despite his more or less constant involvement in the fighting that went on, Kizaru was ultimately one of few people to emerge from the war wholly unscathed, with not a mark to show for it. Following the two-year timeskip, ahead of the Marines' siege of Egghead, Kizaru was chosen to serve as personal protection for one of the Five Elders, having enough trust placed in him to escort said Elder to Egghead and potentially protect him from an Emperor of the Sea, Monkey D. Luffy. Upon personally arriving on the island, Kizaru's presence was immediately sensed by Luffy, who seemed visibly unnerved by the powerful foe he detected. In short order, the admiral went on to defeat Sentomaru, a Haki master who is Vegapunk's strongest bodyguard, dealing the finishing blow with a single laser attack."},

She wears brown boots and a green stocking on her left leg with a design which resembles the Kuja Pirates' Jolly Roger. She is usually seen accompanied by the large panther, Bacura, at her side instead of a snake like the other Kuja. Along with her sisters, her beauty is highly admired by the Amazon Lily islanders. In her younger days, Sandersonia was an average height teen who wore orange skirt and green top. Sandersonia wore a tan bra that seems to be bandaged of some sort, after her clothes were burned during the fight against Monkey D. Luffy. At Rusukaina, Sandersonias attire does not change, with the exception of her cape and the designs of her bikini, which take the form of snake scales. On her back, covered by her cape and her long green hair, is a mark of slavery branded on her by their previous Celestial Dragon masters.

Sandersonia is the most emotional of the 3 sisters and highly emotional about their horrible past, her crying had to be eased by her sister Marigold and drove her to collapse onto the floor. Due to her slave brand's shameful meaning, Sandersonia and her sisters made their fellow Kuja believe that on their backs were a set of eyes she and her sisters received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon.

{"name": "Boa Hancock", "episode": "Episode 516", "chapter": "Chapter 409", "year": 2008, "note": "She was first mentioned by the Risky Brothers in Chapter 489.", "appearance": "Hancock is considered the most beautiful woman in the world. She has a well-proportioned figure compared to her abnormal and huge sisters. She is very tall and slender with long black hair that extends past her waist with locks of hair that frame her face down to her chin and shows off her high forehead, dark brown (dark blue in the anime) eyes with long, voluminous eyelashes and pale skin. She has a narrow waist and very large breasts, and with serpent earrings. Her attire changes frequently. When first introduced, she wore a revealing red V-neck blouse that showed much of her chest and a loose sarong that exposed her long, slender legs with the green symbol of the Kuja adorned on it, along with a white cape sporting epaulettes more commonly found on the jackets of high-ranking Marines, and red high heel pumps. She then wore a qipao with a hooded cloak which she used it to cover Luffy until they arrived at Impel Down and then took it off during the battle against Whitebeard. During the Summit War of Marineford, she wore a purple dress with Kuja designs on it and purple high heel pumps. Upon her return to Amazon Lily, she reverted to her original outfit (with the exception of her cape). In all her outfits, she has worn a pair of golden earrings that resemble snakes and black high-heeled shoes; her attire is also adorned with the emblem of the Kuja, with the exception of when Hancock fell ill due to her Love Sickness, during which she wore a red blouse. After the timeskip, her attire looks the same as when she was first introduced, except it is colored blue (although it remains red in the anime). Her extraordinary beauty is noted by many throughout the world: one of the Risky Brothers claims that her beauty is in second place to the mermaids, especially Shirahoshi, while others like Marguerite and Hannyabal claim she is the most beautiful woman in the world. She is also almost always seen with Salome, her large Snake Weapon, which is usually seen smiling despite wearing a skull. Even though Hancock normally looks either calmly beautiful or cute (in an attempt to \"apologize\" for her actions), she can look very intimidating and angered with her eyes bulging madly and her teeth bared, as seen when Smoker attacked Luffy at Marineford. Before Hancock fell in love with Luffy and when she is not around Luffy, her eyes tend to look emotionless, but when she is around Luffy, her eyes show much more emotion, making her look like a girl in love. Along with her sisters, on her back is the slave mark of the Celestial Dragon, something that she was so intent on keeping secret and was willing to petrify anyone (other than her sisters and Elder Nyon) who saw it. In order to make sure it was never seen, she and her sisters concocted a lie that what was really on the sisters' backs were pairs of Gorgon eyes which would petrify anyone who sets eyes on them. Hancock uses this \"curse\" as an excuse for her and her sisters' Devil Fruit abilities. As a young child, she looked quite similar to how she does now, but the only difference is that only her side-locks went past her shoulders and were worn in beads. During her escape from Mary Geoise, she wore rags and her hair was tied in pigtails. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Hancock is shown wearing a small, laced top with exotic swirl patterns leaving her mid-riff exposed. Her only other piece of clothing is a small loin cloth around her hips. In the 3D2Y special, she wears a purple dress with gold trim as well as black heels, and a great light purple image of her Jolly Roger at the bottom. During the Cidre Guild Arc and One Piece: Stampede, she wears a V-neck black dress with one of the sleeves and a half chest area in white and with images of her Jolly Roger on the part of the skirt, in addition to a purple sash at the waist, and a black cape with a pink interior and with golden shoulder pads, along with black heels.", "personality": "Hancock is a very complex woman. At first glance, she appears to be selfish, pompous, spoiled, and used to having her own way. She can also act arrogant and cruel, usually justifying her less-than-admirable actions with her unmatched beauty, causing her to think that she can get away with anything because the world will forgive her (and save for the handful able to resist she is largely successful in this approach, as gleeful suitors of both genders happily forgive her every transgression). She also made it seem that she did not think much of the Kuja tribe either as she commented to Elder Nyon that she did not care if the island was destroyed or not, since everyone would forgive her anyway because she is beautiful. Because of her beauty and strength, she is used to seeing men and women, young and old alike, fall instantly in love with her. As a result of this, people forgive her when she acts cutely apologetic or reminds them of her beauty. However, when Luffy came along and displayed a complete immunity to her charms, she initially felt that she could not bear the existence of someone completely invulnerable to her powers and would collapse dramatically whenever insulted. This feeling has eroded away, though, as she deeply loves Luffy in spite of his immunity to her. Even after the two-year timeskip, Hancock continues to be in love with Luffy as much as before despite that the latter openly rejected a wedding proposal from her. Even though Luffy repeatedly turns down her marriage proposals, Hancock is not discouraged by this and with every rejection she seemingly becomes more determined to marry him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hancock is widely considered to be extremely powerful by friend and foe alike. Ruling beside her sisters, Hancock has power over Amazon Lily and the rest of the Kuja tribe. As the empress and captain of the tribe, Hancock is the strongest Kuja warrior. The Kuja believe that \"strength is beauty\", and since all members of the tribe state that she is the most beautiful in the world, they believe she is immensely powerful, and the strongest among the entire tribe. It is to be noted that only the strongest Kuja warriors are allowed in the country's pirate crew, Hancock and her sisters were strong enough to be there when they were small children, although it is possible, they were just apprentices like Shanks and Buggy. Her strength is so great that it has even been acknowledged by the Fleet Admiral of the time, Sengoku of the Marines. Gloriosa believed that there was little chance for Hancock to die in the Marineford War because of her great strength. Even former Admiral Kuzan commented on her skills, stating she is not to be underestimated. Further testament to her strength is how she was one of the three Warlords who managed to leave the war without sustaining any injuries. The fact that she can earn a 80,000,000 bounty after her first campaign as a pirate further supports her capabilities. Over a decade later, her bounty become 1,659,000,000 following the disbandment of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. This also speaks to her strength considering unlike the other Warlords, she has not been involved with big name events recently. Crocodile, Buggy and Mihawk are a part of Cross Guild which they put bounties on marines' heads. Law and Jinbe were a part of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance which took down the Beasts Pirates and Big Mom. During the Marineford War, she had managed to take down several Pacifistas single handedly without much effort, where it took the whole Straw Hat Pirates (before their two-year training) to take down just one, which left them greatly worn out. During the Marines and the Blackbeard Pirates invasion of Amazon Lily to capture her, Hancock was able to easily defeat most of both invading parties by petrifying them, including Vice Admiral Yamakaji and two of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains, Catarina Devon and Vasco Shot, whom were among the strongest and most dangerous ex-prisoners in Impel Down Level 6. While Blackbeard was able to defeat Hancock thanks to his ability to nullified other Devil Fruit user abilities, he acknowledged she was worthy of being called the Pirate Empress. He further notes he would be in danger of getting petrified by her if he released her and decide killing her was the safer option, despite knowing he would not be able to return his crewmates to normal if he did. Hancock possessed a very powerful willpower when she is unaffected by Luffy's and Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. Like Luffy, her willpower is so strong that Hancock refused to submit herself to the likes of her enemies when she refused to Koby's demand of becoming a prisoner to the World Government again (due to her being a former slave of the Celestial Dragons). Even when Blackbeard was initially chocking the life out of her, she also refused to give into his demands and remanded defiant towards him."},

However unlike his other CP9 comrades Kaku, Lucci, Kalifa, Jabra, Fukurou, and Kumadori who are shown taking pleasure in fighting, toying with their opponents, and expressing some eccentric personality traits, Blueno remains calm and collected nearly all the time, implying that this is his natural personality. As a result, Blueno comes to symbolize the cynical, evil actions of the World Governmentnamely using Nico Robin, by blackmailing her through traumas inflicted by the World Government in the first place. He is also a calculating and perceptive man as he was the only CP9 agent who noticed that Spandam's Den Den Mushi was off the hook and guessed that something was amiss in Enies Lobby, causing him to leave the Tower of Justice to investigate and to confront Luffy after his suspicions were proven right. Like the others, he is greatly shocked when a pirate managed to fight on par and even overwhelm him. He has great faith in his own powers and his Rokushiki ability.

Compared to some of his more expressive comrades, Blenheim is rather stoic, and he often responds to crises more with anger and frustration than alarm or grief. This was the case when Squard stabbed Whitebeard. Though he often maintains composure when things go awry, he shows more emotion when things good happen, as seen when he cheered and pumped his arms when Ace was freed. Additionally, he was saddened and upset at his captain's decision to make Marineford his final battle, showing that he more so represses his emotions rather than being less feeling by nature.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the 9th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Blenheim has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates.

He also wore a pair of black swim briefs, black knee pads with pink X's on them, wrappings around his ankles, and black shoes. He has a magenta tattoo shaped like a stylized 'S' on his left thigh. As a toy, he appeared as a teddy bear with blue and yellow fur and wearing a purple vest and pants. After the battle in Dressrosa, he wore a high-collared charcoal gray jacket zipped up to his clavicle with an orange star and two yellow stars on the upper sleeve. When the Ideo Pirates intercepted a fight between a longarm and a longleg ships, he wore a gold-colored hoodie.", "personality": "He appears to be a confident fighter with faith in his skills, and because of this he appears to enjoy taunting his opponents. He was also perceptive enough to discover Dagama's attempt to betray him and took the initiative to attack first. Unlike most of the people who were released from Sugar's curse, Blue Gilly is not shown to be swayed by greed as he chose to battle the Donquixote Pirates instead of their enemies, even attacking those who would.

He was also deceptive as he claimed that he liked strong people which incited Ace and Luffy into his crew. However, this was only part of his ploy to use them to load explosives into the Gray Terminal, and then tying them down to leave them to die in the flames after they refused to join his crew. On top of this, his most defining character trait was his wish to become a Noble, for the wealth and the life would grant him. When the king of the Goa Kingdom promised to make him a noble if he would burn down the Gray Terminal and kill its inhabitants, he quickly agreed. This proved to be his downfall, as he was betrayed and left to die with the other inhabitants.

{"name": "Black Maria", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "Her name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978.", "appearance": "Black Maria is a youthful woman of incredible size by human standards, yet still well-proportioned and slender. She is 8.2 meters tall, being slightly larger than Kaidou himself. Her long blonde hair is styled like a geisha's, with two swords notably being part of its arrangement. Her eyes are sky blue, and a strand of hair tends to dangle in front of her left eye. She has a pair of long, slightly curved red horns atop her head, wears prominent lipstick, and carries a long smoking pipe. She wears a low-cut, black kimono that leaves her right shoulder exposed and a turquoise obi around her waist, both with blue and yellow floral patterns. Her footwear is two black Zri with red Hanao (straps) and white tabi (socks). After taking off her Kimono, she covered her breasts with Sarashi. She has the kanji  (jonan, meaning \"woman trouble\"?) tattooed on her back. In her Zoan form, her spider forelimbs each bear a personalized Jolly Roger, indicating she may have them tattooed on her original body.", "personality": "Black Maria is a flirtatious, courtesan-like figure who takes a laid-back approach to her missions and duties as one of the Tobiroppo. When assigned to fight or hunt for a target, Black Maria instead prefers to stay back from the action and enjoy the company of her captain or play music with her subordinates, taking refuge in safe locations away from all the strife while letting her peers deal with the problems themselves. She also has a soft spot for children, taking pity on Momonosuke after he got brutalized by Kanjuro and tending to his injuries before Orochi took him away. That being said, Black Maria can be just as violent and sadistic as the rest of the Beasts Pirates, if not even more. In stark contrast to her usual playfulness seen during the banquet, Black Maria is a ruthless torturer when actually performing her job as a pirate, not holding back her punches for the sake of the crew's objectives. Even if the victim actually decides to cooperate with her, Black Maria may not honor her word and just keep them trapped under her power. When asked about her methods to keep Robin in line should the Beasts Pirates manage to capture her, Black Maria simply stated that she would mutilate the Straw Hat to the point of helplessness, then kill and discard her corpse after her purpose to read Kaidou's Poneglyphs was fulfilled. Black Maria enjoys keeping captive men as \"pets\" for her to play with (particularly those with rebellious personalities). Through torture methods, she forcefully implants obedience and devotion inside the heads of her victims until they become unable to say anything else but declarations of love and worship towards her, effectively turning herself into their subject of adoration. Black Maria is extremely possessive of those men and will not tolerate any attempts of \"infidelity\" from them, resorting to further violent discipline if necessary. Apparently very vain, Black Maria likes to keep up her look as an attractive courtesan, having modified her own Devil Fruit abilities in order to display a more conventionally beautiful form.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Black Maria holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, with only Kaidou and the All-Stars ranking above her. As the owner of the Pleasure Hall, she oversees the goings-on in it. As one of the six strongest Shinuchi with a 480,000,000 bounty (second highest among the Tobiroppo), Black Maria is very powerful and considered potentially able to challenge an All-Star for his position. She has confidence in her own strength, enough to believe that she could easily kill the Nine Red Scabbards after their loss to Kaidou. When the All-Star Jack cast doubt on her ability to do so, Black Maria felt that she was being underestimated. During her fight against Nico Robin and Brook, Black Maria held the upper hand for most of the fight until Robin manage to catch the Tobiroppo in her \"Demonio Fleur\" and break her back. Befitting her oiran image, Black Maria is a skilled musician, being a capable shamisen player and songstress."},
{"name": "Brook", "episode": "Episode 442", "chapter": "Chapter 337", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Before his death, Brook was a tall, tan, skinny man who had a rather distinctive face. He had a slight goatee on his chin and some side burns. He typically wore shades never revealing his eyes. On his forehead was a scar that slightly resembles a diagonal omega sign (). This scar was retained in his skeletal state as a distinctive crack across his skull. Brook's facial appearance, accompanied with his style of clothing, resembles a type of appearance and style that is commonly associated with various music artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendrix, Slash, and other musical celebrities with similar features.", "personality": "Brook is an eccentric character witha distinct personality of his own,like the otherStraw Hat Pirates. While he looks like and fancies himself to be a gentleman, he does possess vulgar and perverted manners and habits such as asking to see women's panties (Although in Camie's case, in a subversion of his usual habit, he asks if she can lend him some money), yelling impatiently for food (a trait shared by Luffy), and occasionally burping and farting conspicuously. Despite this behavior, he still remains very polite, formal,and soft-spoken, usually referring to people using the respectful \"-san\" (\"Sir\") and always speaks to everyone, even enemies, in a very courteous manner. He appreciates the simplest of things: from a gesture of kindness, the company of others, and walking in the sunlight after receiving his shadow back. Brook was moved to tears at just being able to share a dinner with people after decades alone in the Florian Triangle. Despite his eccentric behavior, Brook is an extremely upright and compassionate person befitting of a true gentleman, as Brook utterly disdains wickedness and cruelty. When Zeo began to ruthlessly assault his own men, Brook even defended one of the enemies from Zeo's attack, reprimanding Zeo for his cruelty. Brook's compassion is shown in Zou where he was horrified by the immense devastation the Beasts Pirates caused. He readily helped the badly injured minks along with his crew mates. After Luffy arrived at Zou, Brook gave specific instructions not to mention anything about Wano and samurais out of consideration for the minks. He even beat up Luffy for mentioning Raizo out loud, although it turned out to be for nothing. After Yasuie was executed, Brook was solemn and sympathetic when Hiyori explained how the citizens of Ebisu Town lost the ability to feel or express sadness and despair after being fed faulty SMILE fruits by Kurozumi Orochi as part of his twisted tyranny.", "abilities_and_powers": "As much as Brook normally goofs around on the ship engaging in acts of silliness with Luffy, he is still a formidable opponent. Due to his previous experiences and skills that he amassed from the days when the Pirate King Gol D. Roger was still active, Brook, in all respects, is a veteran pirate (though these attributes are somewhat downplayed by his overall demeanor, along with the fact that his isolation in the Florian Triangle seemed to have eroded his knowledge of modern society). Brook is a talented swordsman, has extraordinary speed due to his light frame, and is astonishingly difficult to harm because of his undead state. When Brook fights, his battles often have a comical element to them, including making a few of the members of his own crew fall asleep while fighting the Flying Fish Riders, playing dead halfway through a battle, or launching himself at an enemy with erroneous results. His childish personality occasionally hampers his effectiveness. Though he often gets scared easily by powerful enemies or the supernatural, he can be very calm and fearless to defend his crew, such as when he willingly sacrificed himself hoping to hold back a Pacifista and Bartholomew Kuma, and when he cleverly realized he could trick Giolla to defeat her. When he first met the Straw Hats, he quickly proved to be an asset to them during their encounters with Thriller Bark's many undead inhabitants. After the two-year time skip, Brook's overall skills increased enough to defeat impressive fighters with little difficulty, such as Zeo, an Energy Steroid-enhanced fish-man, and Giolla, an officer of the Donquixote Pirates. When fighting to reclaim the Thousand Sunny, he and Tony Tony Chopper battled and defeated several of Big Mom's chess soldiers. This earned them praise from Charlotte Katakuri, one of Big Mom's Sweet Commanders. During the Raid on Onigashima, Brook fought against various members of the Beasts Pirates, including the Ancient Zoan user Black Maria (alongside Robin) and defeated Kunyun, Sarahebi, Nure-Onna, and Tenjo-Sagari, a Number and three Gifters, simultaneously and with a single technique. Brook has demonstrated tactical ingenuity, as shown when he used his music to act like he was on Giolla's side, allowing him to regain his sword from her and defeat her. He also got the idea to store the copies of Big Mom's Poneglyphs inside his head before she confronted and later captured him. He is very good at working with others to execute plans in tandem, as shown when he took advantage of Pedro's distraction to get around his strongest opponents and enter the Room of Treasure. He also disguised himself as a clone of Luffy to take advantage of the chaos when Luffy crashed Big Mom's tea party, and he destroyed Big Mom's portrait of Carmel without being noticed. He also has a strong will, as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki."},

The only thing added to his attire is his spiral-patterned cloak.", "personality": "Beckman appears to be a lot less fun-loving and a lot more relaxed than the other members of the crew are, acting as the level-headed member. He, Lucky Roux, and Yasopp are some of Shanks' most trusted crew members, as they are always seen when the Red Hair Pirates are featured, usually when something crucial happens. He is a well-deserved vice-captain who silently supports the crew with a deep attitude despite their liveliness. At times, Beckman seems amused at the actions of his captain, such as panicking when Luffy is taken or getting even more drunk when he has already drunk a lot before and when Dracule Mihawk brought the news of Luffy's first bounty. He is the first to speak out among the crew whenever they appear. He also seems to be the first to ask questions about the crew's situation, such as whether the World Government would try to stop them from seeing Whitebeard. He is a playboy and loves women.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the first mate of the Red Hair Pirates, Beckman is the crew's second highest authority behind Shanks himself. He holds a great deal of experience as the eldest of the crew's core members. As a combatant, Beckman is very powerful with superb combat effectiveness and agility.

Bingo, in particular, was taking advantage of people mourning their deceased relatives by selling them caskets at outrageous prices. Bingo is also a foolish man whose base instincts and passion led him to ruin. The prospect of having a life with the highest-ranking courtesan Komurasaki was enough to get Bingo to sell everything he had, to the point of committing the typically immoral act of selling his family. This consuming passion made him trusting of Komurasaki to a fault, being willing to leave all the money he earned with her without using any legal safeguards. After finding out that Komurasaki had swindled him, Bingo fell into complete despair, leading him to go all the way toward trying to kill the courtesan he was once enamored with to avenge his destitution, and this desire was all he cared about to the point where he did not care if he was killed afterward.

She wore a green checkered shirt with the word \"MACE\" on it, indigo trousers and brown sandals. She was also rarely seen without a cigarette. Back in her days as a Marine, she wore the simple uniform with the officer's jacket draped over like a cape.", "personality": "In her youth she was a renowned trouble maker. While her decision to join the Marines shocked all the villagers, they all cared deeply for her welfare despite the trouble that she had always given them. Due to her past, her decision to adopt her daughters led them to fear the children's own welfare. However, Bell-mre was determined to show them that she had grown into a mature adult who was capable of such responsibilities. As a Marine, Bell-mre was quite confident, her reaction to Shiki's escape from Impel Down being to state that she will stop him herself should he attack the East Blue. Her fellow marines note that she is very reliable, indicating she was likely a very effective member of the Marines. Bell-mre retains some of her mischievous nature upon her return to Cocoyasi, offering to pay Genzo for Nami's thefts \"with her body\" (this most likely explaining where Nami got her personality from, as Nami even used the phrase when Genzo captured her, much to his frustration), despite knowing how he reacts. She occasionally acts impulsively, such as when she hits Nami for suggesting that Nojiko is not her real sister, and hits a boy for saying that her mikans taste bad moments after Bell-mre stated to Nami she shouldn't have hit the boy. She admits that Nojiko is sometimes more mature than she is.", "abilities_and_powers": "Bell-mre has fought many pirates throughout her time as marine and gathered enough battle experience to survive.

His legs, being exposed, are hairy. Underneath these clothes, his physique is relatively muscular, as seen during the Impel Down Arc, possibly as a result of his training in Okama Kenpo. Like all Baroque Works agents, he bears his number in his appearance. Mr. 2 Bon Kurei's number 2 is seen in the form of his swans, which are posed into a shape resembling the number \"2\". When he was impersonating Nefertari Cobra, he wore the king's robes and sandals. The back of his overcoat bears the characters for his credo, the Okama Way (?). During Miss Goldenweek's \"Operation: Meet Baroque Works\", he wears a dark suit with a dress shirt covered in 2's underneath with dark pants. Later in the cover story, he wears Mr. 3's attire, which is a dark hoodie with two number 3's on it, striped pants that only extend a little bit past the knee, and light-colored shoes. Later, in Impel Down, he wears a striped, rag-like prisoner's outfit. He also wore Hannyabal's headdress and pants when he was disguised as him. After entering Level 5.5, he wore bandages on his arms, abdomen, and neck, and purple pants that cut off below his knees and black boots. When he let his fellow prisoners escape, he was disguised as Magellan, wearing his coat and pants. Two years later, when he becomes the new Queen of Newkama Land, he is shown wearing a slightly different version of his ballet clothes with some features such as bigger wings and furry collar.", "personality": "Bentham has a flamboyant attitude, which includes singing, dancing, and spinning, much to the annoyance of the other Officer Agents. Despite being an assassin, he prioritizes friendship above all else. He's the only higher up that lacks a female partner of the same rank. Possibly because he believes he is both male and female, probably due to his powers and lifestyle as a self-proclaimed okama, despite never actually wearing women's clothing besides the makeup smeared on his face. He is assigned both a number and a holiday for his code name. As opposed to the ideas of his fellow agents, Mr. 1 and Mr. 5, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei much values friendship as evidenced by his selfless sacrifice to allow the Straw Hats to escape Arabasta when Captain Hina ambushed them. Later, he once again attacked Hina to save Miss Valentine, and finally, he risked his life to open the Gates of Justice for everyone in Impel Down. This also shows that he is incredibly selfless and righteous, and is extremely proud of himself for it (telling Magellan he had no regrets for his sacrifice). He will often motivate such actions by saying that abandoning his companions goes against \"the okama way\". This did not hinder him from attacking Vivi during the face-off at Alubarna, though. He always finishes a sentence with a \"wa yo,\" which in Japanese reflects a feminine (if assertive) speech pattern. He also often says, \"Jodan janai wa yo!\" (, Jdan janai wa yo?, translates as \"It's not a joke!\" or \"Not joking around!\") as his catchphrase. He also says \"Un Deux Trois\" (one, two, three in French) while asking others what four is. According to himself, his favorite word is vague.", "abilities_and_powers": "Before the fall of Baroque Works, Bentham was amongst the top-ranked members of the criminal organization, and presumably had several \"Billions\" (the lower-ranked subordinates of Baroque Works Officer Agents) under his command. As an okama, Bentham has no shortage of tricks in his arsenal. While fond of singing and dancing, he is also an accomplished martial artist, even though his real threat does not come from his fighting ability. His actual threat level comes from his skills in deception and tricking his enemies through his Devil Fruit Powers combined with his acting skills to trick his enemies into doing what he pleases."},

She was fully introduced in Chapter 718.", "appearance": "Unlike the stocky build of most other dwarves, Bian has a slender and curvy figure. She has brown eyes, dark brown hair in a bobcut, and a black and pink striped tail. She has a fluffy pale orange scarf, a short dress similarly striped as her tail with long black sleeves, and tight black pants. She wears lipstick and appears to wear a domino mask. She also wears white boots, gloves, and tophat. While in her bee hybrid form, she has a second pair of arms, a pair of gray antennae that curves out over the brim of her hat, and transparent orange insect wings. After becoming part of Leo's pirate crew, she wears a light-colored pirate hat with the crew's jolly roger on it.", "personality": "Bian is quite punctual, since she was stressing the need to leave on time when Leo arrived late.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a dwarf she likely possesses great strength, speed, and the ability to cultivate any plant."},
{"name": "Bepo", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Bepo is a polar bear mink. He wears an orange jumpsuit that bears the Heart Pirates' jolly roger. He also wears small brown boots and has sharp teeth and claws. He is as tall as a normal bear, considerably taller than common humans. In Wano Country, he had a topknot despite having short fur and no hair. He also wore a yukata with the Heart Pirates' jolly roger surrounded by fish.", "personality": "Bepo tends to get depressed easily and apologizes whenever people point out that he is a talking bear. An example of his sensitivity is when Hancock called him a beast and scolded him for attempting to change the subject. His crewmates also scolded him when he wondered aloud whether Amazon Lily had female bears, much to their annoyance. Overall, members of the Heart Pirates accuse Bepo of having a weak will. Ironically, he was able to remain conscious after taking a blast of Haoshoku Haki from Rayleigh, a feat only the exceptionally strong-willed can accomplish. Those who do not know him call him meek. He has been shown to order Jean Bart around (albeit unsuccessfully), seemingly delighted to have seniority over him. At the same time, he does not want Jean Bart to order him around. In the anime, he is shown to dislike hot environments (possibly due to his thick fur and the jumpsuit he wears), as he complained when the Heart Pirates' submarine was near an underwater volcanic region. Much like other male characters when they see a robot, Bepo is able to express admiration towards the General Franky. Sometimes, he can do foolish things like eating a fish from a toxic river.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the navigator of the Heart Pirates, it can be assumed that Bepo has the knowledge required to navigate the seas. The level of his skills is as yet unknown, though it is expected that he is reasonably capable of navigating through the Grand Line. Interestingly enough, despite his occupation, he is not seen wearing a Log Pose, which is essential for Grand Line navigation. He also has some skill in cartography, as he was the one who drew the map of Dressrosa and Green Bit that Law shared with the Straw Hats. However, he appears to be a bit messy, as the map had his paw print on it, and Nami stated that his map-drawing and navigation skills are far from her own. Bepo is fairly strong-willed, being able to withstand a blast of Silvers Rayleigh's Haki. He also has extremely good hearing, being able to detect a sniper and his exact positioning quickly by picking up the moment of fire with his ears. Befitting the animal he is based after, Bepo is an excellent swimmer and can attain great speeds while at sea."},

His most distinctive feature is his large scar running from his left shoulder down to his chest. He wore green pants with a camouflage pattern (plain green in the anime). After being turned into a woman by Emporio Ivankov's Emporio Onna Hormone, Bellett's appearance changed completely except for her scar and blonde hair. As a woman, she is much more slender than her male form, and is also well-endowed.In the anime, Bellett's skin tone also changes drastically between her forms for some reason.", "personality": "As a man, Bellett was very loyal to his family and also very vengeful, as he tried to avenge them after his father became an okama, which in turn forced him to become a pirate. But after being turned into a woman, she became quite shy and embarrassed of her new gender.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about Bellett's fighting ability, although he is resilient enough to survive being shot by a cannonball that had been deflected by Iva's Death Wink."},

She wears a green bandana over her forehead and pinkish-red lens-less glasses over the bandana.", "personality": "Belladonna seems quite calm and relaxed at times of danger, such as when she lit Luffy on fire, and showed no concern or fear that her home would burn down. She seems to be quite knowledgeable about medicine, despite being isolated from the rest of the world. Her medical abilities seem to be of high level and she is smart enough to know that Luffy's rubbery body is not natural and that the Gorgon Sister's powers do not come from slaying a gorgon as they claimed.[citation needed] However, she does not have knowledge about Devil Fruits.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Kuja tribe, it can be assumed that Belladonna also can use Haki.

{"name": "Bellamy", "episode": "Episode 222", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Bellamy is a tall man with tan skin and short, unkempt blond hair. During the Jaya Arc, he wore white pants, a green sash with markings, and a pink sleeveless shirt with a navy blue pirate captain's coat over it. The coat tended to fall off whenever Bellamy used his spring-based jumping. He has a scar above his right eye and tattoos of eye-like designs on his arms. He has a trademark grin and sometimes sticks out his tongue in a taunting manner. After the timeskip, he grew in size dramatically. He now wears a pair of black sunglasses and bears two new scars, one across each side of his face, possibly from either his humiliating defeat by Luffy or from Doflamingo's punishment, or both. He has discarded his captain's coat and now wears a short sleeved shirt with his old jolly roger on the back (now painted over with a cross), which is left open to display Doflamingo's mark tattooed on his chest.", "personality": "Before he visited an unnamed sky island, Bellamy was characterized as violent and conceited. He was very arrogant and highly confident in his own powers. He would only attack foes he thought he could win against, and this attitude led to his eventual defeat at Monkey D. Luffy's hands; Bellamy thought he was weak, not knowing that he had recently defeated a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile, and obtained a new bounty of 100,000,000, before moving into Jaya. He loved to have an audience to witness his feats. He was ruthless, as he attacked Roshio over a trivial matter and laughed at other people's misfortune. Like Donquixote Doflamingo, he heavily believed in the \"New Age\" and thought it would soon come after what he calls the \"Age of Dreams\", the current era in which people dream of finding One Piece and becoming the Pirate King. His philosophy of the \"New Age\" led him to taunt and laugh at anyone with such grand dreams as Luffy's; little did Bellamy know that Doflamingo himself aspired to become the Pirate King. Indeed, his cruelty is well known even in the New World, after the timeskip, even though he changed a lot. Bellamy's arrogance tended to heavily influence his opinions of what the world presents before him; this became evident when he dismissed the possibility that there was someone stronger than him during his stay at Jaya when the local drunk presented him and his crew with Luffy and Zoro's new bounties. Like the rest of his crew, Bellamy misinterpreted that a bounty represented a person's fighting level, causing him to believe he was fearsome despite his bounty being only a little higher than average based on Grand Line standards. His crew did nothing to discourage that belief and even went as far as to give him the nickname \"Big-Time Rookie\". As a result, he seemed to consider himself destined for greatness. Bellamy earned his nickname from his trademark grin, constant laughter, and reputation for scavenging riches from other pirates, much like a hyena scavenges its food. He and Sarquiss usually hunted down pirates who were weaker than them, beat them mercilessly, let the rest of the crew \"pick up the trash\", and then robbed them of their treasures while mocking them. After the two-year timeskip, Bellamy has lost much of his arrogance and gained a cold, calm demeanor. He no longer mocks people, as his only ambition was to become Doflamingo's right-hand man. However, he still appears to relish battle, as seen in his fights with Tank Lepanto and with Abdullah and Jeet, wherein the commentator noted his viciousness. In addition, he has become much more observant, as he was able to recognize Luffy through his disguise, and promised not to laugh at him anymore. He also has a strong sense of honor, as he was disgusted by the fact that Tank Lepanto had accepted a bribe, and after the match he told Luffy that by cheering him on he had crushed his pride. More of this reformed personality was shown when he showed reluctance to fulfill Doflamingo's order to kill Luffy. Bellamy was immensely loyal to Doflamingo, a man he had admired and idolized since his youth. He briefly refused to believe that Doflamingo had ordered Dellinger to finish him off in case he failed, and even after realizing it was true, he refused to betray the man he respected. After confronting Doflamingo and being brutally beaten, Bellamy lost his will to live and begged to be killed. Even after Doflamingo told Bellamy just how little he thought of him and forced him to fight Luffy, he did not let go of his loyalty, choosing to attack Luffy even after Doflamingo's control was lifted. Though he realized that his admiration was misplaced and considered himself a fool, Bellamy held on to his principles. Forcing a smile, he claimed that he would keep seeking Doflamingo's approval by taking Luffy down with him but winced when Luffy pointed out that Doflamingo probably knew that Bellamy would try to fight him to the death. After Doflamingo's downfall, Bellamy seemed to forgo his loyalty towards Doflamingo, given Bellamy's newfound friendship with Luffy. Having finally foregone his loyalty to Doflamingo, Bellamy chose to change his ways and quit piracy to find a new life as an apprentice dyer.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to the timeskip, Bellamy appeared to be an average fighter without the aid of his Bane Bane no Mi, upon which he heavily depended. Bellamy easily defeated Shoujou, who had a bounty of 36,000,000, and Roshio, who had a bounty of 42,000,000; both fights were won thanks to his Bane Bane no Mi. However, he had enough talent to receive a bounty of 55,000,000 and also possessed enough talent to be accepted by Doflamingo as his ally. Before becoming a full-time member of the Donquixote Pirates, Bellamy was not a particularly powerful pirate. He usually only enjoyed attacking opponents whose bounties and strength were inferior to his own in order to intimidate others. In addition to being known as \"The Big-Time Rookie\", when his bounty was technically below Grand Line standards. After the timeskip, his overall abilities have improved. After losing to Luffy, he began to improve by surviving Sky Island and returning with a large golden pillar, which he presented to Doflamingo and having attacked many countries that messed with Dressrosa. Furthermore, he was able to survive in the New World, with his bounty rising to 195,000,000, more than triple his first known bounty. All of this gave him a second chance in the Donquixote Pirates. Bellamy was considered one of the favorites to win the final B block, so much so that Dagama advised his allies to defeat him first as he was considered one of the strongest. Despite this, his strength seems considerably inferior to the true officers of the crew, as Doflamingo, once he changed his mind again, sent Dellinger to kill him. Intellectually, he became far more perceptive, as he instantly recognized Luffy through his heavy disguise, a feat most of the other contestants within the room could not manage even when Luffy inadvertently blurted out his identity. He also managed to deduce Bartolomeo's Bari Bari no Mi's weakness after a few of his direct attacks were deflected. He was ultimately knocked out by King Elizabello's \"King Punch\" before he could exploit this weakness, though he regained consciousness soon after the match ended and was seen talking to Luffy."},

He wears a gray metal mask with fourteen (ten in the anime before the timeskip) eye-holes and two long, curved bull horns; his face has never been fully exposed. His long orange hair falls to the front of his chest and the rest of his hair can be seen going down his back. As with many high-ranking officers, he wears a double-breasted suit with a blue shirt and black tie, and a military overcoat he wears draped over his shoulders with chains hanging from the lapels. In his youth, his hair was much shorter. He also wore a different mask with smaller horns and only twelve eye-holes as opposed to the more imposing one he now uses. Bastille's first present-day mask was destroyed after Sabo used Ryusoken to initially crack it, then plucked it from Bastille's face upon defeating him and crushed it in a display of power before other Marines. He replaced it with a similar mask that had a different pair of horns which are more angular and have ridges.", "personality": "As a Marine, he likely holds a strong belief in justice. Whether he believes in moral justice or absolute justice, however, is not known as of yet. He is also rather displeased with junior colleagues who he believes to act rashly. This can be seen when he criticizes his colleague Maynard for entering the colosseum so recklessly.Despite this, he seems to care about his subordinates as he told them to stay away from Sabo. He also proved to be quite cunning, as he quickly realized that someone had taken control of the eastern port of Dressrosa after asking his caller via slug for his name and registration number to verify that he really was a Marine. He also has a tendency to end his sentences with \"-dara\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine vice admiral, Bastille has authority over lower-ranking subordinates.

He wears a dark purple coat with a stripe down each sleeve and a plumed collar and cuffs. On the back of it is a face with its head on fire with two crossing sabers just underneath it. He has a light-colored ring-patterned belt with a chain on the left. He has a weapon tucked in the front of his baggy checkered trousers, and has light ruffled dark boots on his feet. Two years ago, he sported a yellow and red vertically striped coat with tan fur around the neck. He also had brown pants and a black belt. His hair was not as wild, being more slicked back in a pompadour style.", "personality": "Bartolomeo can be rather vulgar and laid-back at times, as during the battle royale in B Block, he was lying on the sides watching the battle and then casually urinated off the side on the ring in front of all the spectators. His overall attitude and lack of refinement made him a very unpopular person among the audience, who booed Bartolomeo at every turn. During his formal introduction, Bartolomeo is said to be ranked number one on the \"pirate we wish most to disappear\" list. He is also very provocative, as Bartolomeo not only taunts the crowd with his shenanigans, but also mocks his opponents, usually in a nonchalant manner. Even when attempting to stay cool, however, Bartolomeo can become angered when provoked in return; when the spectators at the stadium insulted and threw junk at him, he in turn threw a fake bomb at the audience to scare them. Bartolomeo also does not care what anyone else thinks of him, bluntly having stated to Dagama that popularity among an audience of jackasses is the least of his concerns. He did not even mind that he made enemies with the Donquixote Pirates by saving Bellamy, even treating it with blissful indifference. He also loves to mock his opponents as he pretends to be afraid when Hack was going to attack him only to reveal his Devil Fruit to make Hack's attack back fire on him. As his own phrasing states, Bartolomeo also does not seem to hold a high opinion of people, practically denouncing them as when he voiced his disgust by the crowd's reaction when he threw the fake bomb into the stands, seeing them step over, push and trample one another to escape. He can be bold and daring, even towards one of the Four Emperors, as shown when he burned the Red Hair Pirates' Jolly Roger (unaware of their connection to Luffy). However, Bartolomeo seems to care for his crew, as he violently beat up Vice Admiral Maynard for what he did to Gambia. That aside, it is this particular course of violence that has made him infamous, as he was noted to have gunned down several innocent civilians in the past. Despite such a destructive nature, he can restrain his murderous rage to a certain extent, at least by the regulations set by the Corrida Colosseum. While he is very laid-back, he is not immune to expressing shock as such when he heard that Luffy is around. Despite the cruelty he shows to others, he has immense respect for the Straw Hat Pirates. After witnessing Luffy's miraculous survival on the execution stand in Loguetown two years ago, Bartolomeo became a massive fan of Luffy's and views him as his hero, even to the point of worshipping him. After following Luffy's exploits up until the Summit War of Marineford, he was inspired to start his life of piracy. His respect for Luffy is so deep that he gets angry and attacks people who mock Luffy, as seen when he squashed a man against a wall with his Devil Fruit powers and even cuts the man's tongue right after he badmouthed Luffy. Bartolomeo also expressed shyness towards Luffy as he hesitated to speak to him face to face. Bartolomeo has been shown to get easily excited when he sees the people he idolizes as when he saw Zoro, he burst into tears out of joy. He weeps uncontrollably even when doing something as simple as asking Zoro for an autograph. When he came face to face with Luffy, he screamed in joy. It has been revealed that he only entered the tournament in order to win the Mera Mera no Mi and give it to Luffy. Bartolomeo has been shown to have some honor, as he saved Bellamy from being brutally killed by Dellinger. Even though he and Bellamy fought against each other in the tournament, Bartolomeo stated that those who fought together are friends and he would not let a friend die without helping. Bartolomeo has a distinct speech style, ending his sentences with \"-dabe\", a copula originating from northeast Japan dialects and typically associated with the country bumpkin stereotype. Like many others, he has a unique laugh: \"Hehehahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a pirate captain and former mafia boss, with 150 towns under him, he likely has great skill as a leader. Bartolomeo is a Supernova, meaning that the Marines consider him to be a serious threat despite being a rookie pirate. He is shown to be strong enough to easily defeat Vice Admiral Maynard, and was able to win the B Block of the Corrida Colosseum tournament without getting so much as a scratch (though he was actually laying on the sidelines watching while avoiding conflict until he was forced to use his barriers). Bartolomeo faced Gladius, one of the officers of the Donquixote Pirates, with Cavendish in a two-on-one match and then in a singles match; although on both occasions he was more focused on protecting Robin, he managed to defeat him with a single decisive blow."},
{"name": "Basil Hawkins", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Hawkins is a tall man, with black triangle symbols on his eyebrows, red eyes, and golden hair that reaches down to his hips. He also has a black cross patte tattooed at the base of his throat. His attire includes a pure white coat with a ruffled neckline and sleeves. He also wears purple trousers tucked inside black boots with white laces on them and a dark ornament made of fur circling the lower part of his torso, with a lighter shade in the middle of it. He also has a pink sash tied around his waist, with a piece of jewelry hanging from it. Hawkins also wears dark gloves similar to those worn by Blueno of CP9, and an armor-like armlet can be seen on his left arm around his left biceps, which also extends to cover his left shoulder. On his right hip he carries a sword with an elaborate pommel that resembles a voodoo doll. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Hawkins is shown with much shorter hair and wore a similar shirt to the one he wore before the timeskip but in pink. He wore light and dark green striped pants. He is also shown with his trademark stoic expression, possibly partaking in a tarot card reading. After the timeskip, he changed the white cloak to a dark blue, green and black checkered pattern, reminiscent of a Scottish kilt, a pink sash on an orange, on which hangs the same ornament. Also, he wears the same black fur belt, but already with blue ornament instead of red, the same black and purple armor, but at the same time stopped wearing gloves. In addition, his hair and skin became lighter. During the Wano Country Arc, he wore a long black cape (white in the manga), a dark shirt (white in the anime) with a ruffled collar low enough to show his tattoo, a brown glove on his left hand (Hawkins wore two brown gloves when he was in Rasetsu District), purple trousers with a checkered pattern with ruffles from the hems, a cream-colored cravat fastened by a dark cross patte-shaped pendant, and brown boots. He also wore a black and red violet armor-like armlet. During the raid on Onigashima, he fought against Killer and had his left arm sliced off.", "personality": "Hawkins portrays himself in a noble and enigmatic manner. He almost always remains completely calm regardless of the situation, showing no emotional response to events that would be considered outrageous to most people. Even when approached by a powerful enemy like a Marine Admiral, Hawkins rarely falters from his usual composure while considering his options for the situation at hand. He is not entirely unemotional though, but in the rare occasion he expresses anything more than general aloofness, it tends to be brief and downplayed. So far, Hawkins has exhibited visible shock, unease, and even sadism at certain points. Hawkins is an extremely serious, no-nonsense individual, claiming to dislike jokes, not being bothered by nudity, and having little tolerance for unruly behavior. He almost dismissed joining forces with the Kid Pirates and On Air Pirates for this reason, as he thought those crew's respective captainsEustass Kid and Scratchmen Apoowere not respecting his time due to constant infighting. Thanks to this seriousness, Hawkins holds a logical, pragmatic mindset when it comes to confrontations, even admitting in his fight against Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro that he is not above fighting unfairly in order to subjugate a worthy foe, like his fellow members of the Worst Generation. This is facilitated by his Devil Fruit abilities, which allow him to take other people's lives hostage and utilize these as bargaining chips. Still, Hawkins can demonstrate honor and release hostage lives if his goals or demands are met. Hawkins has the habit of foretelling the fate of those around him, sometimes remarking on it regardless of its significance (ranging from death to one's clothes getting stained). In fact, he spends most of his time reading and analyzing his tarot cards, which appear to be his main tools for fortune-telling. Hawkins has the utmost confidence in his cartomancy, using it to calculate the probabilities of certain outcomes happening and determine a course of action to follow. Joining the Beasts Pirates, for example, was a result of that, as any other alternative had a zero percent chance of survival according to him. Hawkins often accompanies his fortune insights with vague, ominous-sounding statements like \"seeing the shadow of death upon one's future\", doing so either to reassure others or as a threat towards an opponent. Hawkins prefers avoiding needless violence and commotion as much as possible, even apologizing in behalf of his crewmates in order to not make a scene. He is a quick thinker and can make lies on the spot in order to prevent a disaster in the process. On the other hand, Hawkins is a cruel and ruthless fighter who is not against slaughtering whole crews in his way. He has little regard for the lives of the people represented through his Straw Men, letting them endure lethal damage meant for himself without regret or concern.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Captain of the Hawkins Pirates, Basil has complete authority over the crew. And as a member of the Worst Generation, the World Government recognized him as a fearsome Pirate who, with his crew managed to survive the first half of the Grand Line and enter the New World. He dealt crippling injuries to the Brownbeard Pirates, and their Captain, Chadros Higelyges, all but ending their career as Pirates. After the timeskip, his bounty of 249,000,000 was raised to 320,000,000, the fifth highest among the Supernovas, being the same as Jewelry Bonney. Hawkins' strength and abilities have shown to match his reputation, becoming one of the Beast Pirates' Shinuchi. He is among the few people who could deal faint wounds on Zoro, someone who hasn't received wounds since the timeskip; however, Zoro was protecting Luffy and an ailing Tama, after his Staw Man's Card targeted them, but proved incapable of doing much against the Pirate Hunter. As a Shinuchi, he holds a high position in the Beasts Pirates, has authority over lower-ranking members, and is one of the top authorities in Bakura Town along with Holed'em and Speed."},
{"name": "Bartholomew Kuma", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Kuma is an enormous man, being 689cm tall. He is the second tallest of the former Warlords (being three centimeters shorter than Gecko Moria) and is usually seen carrying a Bible. He has a pair of round, bear-like ears that protrude from the top of his head. His eyes are strangely covered by clear-mirrored lenses; while initially, he will give the impression of wearing glasses, it seems that, based on the Pacifista that were destroyed, that his own eyes were actually replaced by cybernetic ones. Several decades ago, when Bonney was a young child, his eyes and ears were normal, and he wore eyeglasses. His white hat and the dark blue fabric of his pants are covered in brown spots. His jacket contains a large white design reminiscent of a target crosshair or a coda sign. There are also several white paw prints lining the bottom hem of his coat. He also has a long protruding chin. He bears the tattoo \"PX-0\" on the left side of the base of his throat, after the final touches were done on him becoming a complete cyborg before the Summit War of Marineford. In the anime, Kuma's hair and jacket are black, and his hat is gray with black paw-like prints. In the manga, Oda originally intended for Kuma to have a completely different color scheme. Kuma's hair was shown to be brown, his jacket bright orange, and his hat yellow with green spots. Later on the cover of Chapter 532, his coat was changed from orange to blue, though the rest of his design remained untouched. Later still, on Volume 90, Kuma's hair was changed to black, matching his depiction in the anime. In Unlimited Cruise, Kuma's jacket is brown. After the timeskip, Kuma's cybernetic armor has become heavily damaged, with a few weapons jutting out of his body, fruit of his mission to protect the Thousand Sunny from attackers for two years. Due to his subsequent enslaving at Mary Geoise, he now wears rags similar to the ones Jean Bart once wore when he was a slave, a collar and chain around his neck, has even more swords jutting out of his body as result of the World Nobles inflicting damage onto him for their own amusement, one of his cybernetic eyes is missing and he no longer holds his signature Bible. After he was freed from slavery, he went back to his original clothes and had all the swords removed from his body and it appears that his cybernetics have been repaired. Like all slaves of the World Nobles, Kuma has the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon burned into him[citation needed], marking him forever as \"less than human\". In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Kuma had short hair and was missing his bear ears, glasses, and cybernetic enhancements he receives later on. He wore tattered clothing and wooden sandals carrying a heavy load of chopped firewood on his back while reading a book called \"Ninokin\".", "personality": "Kuma is an enigmatic man who is apparently famous for his fury and cruelty. Calm and composed, Kuma generally does not speak much unless absolutely necessary and maintains a stoic, robotic disposition at all times. When talking, Kuma customarily uses the word \"target\" in his sentences. He also tends to ask a person where they would like to go on a holiday before sending them away with his Devil Fruit ability, often honoring the recipient's request, but will occasionally send them to a place of his own choosing regardless of whether or not he received a reply. In spite of his epithet implying a violent personality, Kuma was said to be a gentle man (according to Sabo) whose kindness earned him great respect from his fellow Revolutionaries. Likewise, Kuma was a very loving father to his only daughter, Bonney. Indeed, Bonney vouched that her father's reputation as an evil tyrant was falsely advertised by the Government and that he is in fact a very kind individual. This is further reinforced during the latter portion of the Thriller Bark Arc, where Kuma displays honor and respect towards Roronoa Zoro for putting his own life on the line for his captain's safety, an act that impressed the Warlord enough to give the swordsman a chance to save his own crew, in spite of that conflicting with the mission he was assigned. There are still several mysteries behind Kuma's character. The details behind his transformation into a \"Pacifista\" and what exactly it entails are still unknown. His past as a king and as a child have also been hinted to be quite tragic and horrifying, with Kuma in particular feeling embarassed about the idea of others delving too deep into his private memories. Although he obeys the commands of the World Government, Kuma disagrees with what his superiors deem \"good\" and \"evil\" in the world. He even goes so far as to speculate that Blackbeard's acceptance into the Warlord ranks had been a very poor decision by the government, despite the fact that it filled the position left by Crocodile's defeat. However, Kuma's loyalty does not extend to the Marines. This can be seen when he declines to answer a direct question from Admiral Kizaru during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc. Due to his refusal to assist the Marines without a direct order, Kuma did not hesitate to lie when it came to his victory over the Straw Hat Pirates at Sabaody Archipelago. Despite being perceived as the most dutiful of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Kuma was never really loyal to the World Government's cause, and was in fact acting as a double agent. Kuma was shown to be a brilliant agent of deception, managing to successfully manipulate the World Government from discovering his true affiliation towards the Revolutionary Army for several years. It is also heavily implied that Luffy being the son of his superior, Monkey D. Dragon, was the main reason for Kuma's continued assistance of the Straw Hat Pirates. At present, however, Kuma's modifications have been completed. In the finalization of the Pacifista project, Kuma eventually lost his free will, personality and memory to the modifications, in order to ensure his reliability and continuing services towards the World Government. In this stage, Kuma shares the same mindless intelligence of his fellow Pacifista models, only recognizing individuals as either enemies or allies to the World Government. Doflamingo refers to the original personality as being \"dead\", though it was later revealed that Kuma and Dr. Vegapunk (the man responsible for his cybernetic implants) made a secret deal to allow for Kuma to have a temporary relapse by rendering his final \"free thought\" as defending the Thousand Sunny. After that, Kuma was relegated to working as a slave-to-rent and obeying the demands of the World Nobles without question.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to his final Pacifista modifications, Kuma was an officer in the Revolutionary Army. As a result, he had control over its lower ranking members. However, he lost this power when he became a complete slave of the World Government. As the former king of the Sorbet Kingdom, he once held political power. Kuma was shown to be brilliant at deception, managing to successfully trick the World Government about his true affiliation with the Revolutionary Army for several years, as well as being elected to the position of one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Kuma is one of the few people to have completely defeated the Straw Hat Pirates and is also the only character introduced so far that has defeated the crew single-handedly, twice. However, the crew was extremely weak and injured both times and they were in no shape to fight another battle, much less a Warlord (in the first encounter, the crew had just finished battling another Warlord of the Sea, Gecko Moria, as well as an island full of zombies and a giant zombie named Oars; in the second encounter, they had just battled against a Pacifista while fending off a second, alongside Sentomaru and Marine Admiral Kizaru). He did not want the crew dead, however, since he allowed them to escape, indicating he might have held back. He is extremely fast, enough to seem as though he has disappeared in the eyes of the Straw Hats, as well everyone on Thriller Bark. This is, however, unclear if it has something to do with the modifications from Dr. Vegapunk, or if it is part of his Devil Fruit powers, or simply his raw speed. He has such a fierce reputation that even other powerful and famous pirates are unnerved by him, as seen when the captain of the Kid Pirates, Eustass Kid, seemed heavily disturbed when he witnessed the arrival of a Pacifista (mistaking it for the real Kuma) on the Sabaody Archipelago, despite the fact that his bounty was higher than Kuma's former one."},

Bao Huang is also responsible for announcements through Onigashima, updating her allies with important intel during the events of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance raid.

She is very talkative and will gladly give detailed explanations on the inner workings of her inventions. She is quite interested in the question of the definition of reality, and though she has a firm view on the matter, she thinks other people need to decide the answer for themselves.

She is also shown to be rather reckless, as she recklessly fought against CP0 despite Shaka warning her that she cannot win against CP0.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a satellite of Vegapunk, Atlas has been a contributor to the genius scientists numerous technological developments. Atlas seems to carry out a human's basic need of violence, and also possibly, physical workouts on behalf of the other Vegapunks, which she fulfills by attacking holograms. Befitting her large size, Atlas possesses significant strength, as she was able to punch Luffy and send him slamming into a wall with great force, leaving him with bruises. She also possesses great durability, being barely affected by a normal punch from Luffy. Her body made a metallic clanging sound when Luffy struck it, meaning she may wear armor or have cyborg modifications. According to her, she is capable of changing her mask at will and replace whatever part of her gets damaged. However, how she is possible to do that or if it is something she created has yet to be explored upon."},

This was demonstrated when he followed Whitebeard's orders to attack the Marines' battleships to enter the bay at Marineford.

{"name": "Alvida", "episode": "Episode 2", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Originally, Alvida was a tall and very obese woman with long wavy black hair and freckles on her cheeks. She wore a white cowgirl hat with a large red plume, a red neckerchief, a pink plaid shirt, and a blue captain's coat over it with the arms in the sleeves, unlike many other pirates. She wore rings on her fingers and her long sharp fingernails had red polish. She had a purple sash with a flintlock pistol tucked in it and some jewels. She also wore graying pants and red shoes with gold buckles. After eating a Devil Fruit, Alvida has transformed by shedding the excess weight from her body. The Sube Sube no Mi makes Alvida very slippery and, aside from the cowboy hat she wears, Alvida looks totally different from her original form, being slim, well-endowed, with dark-green eyes (before brown), while maintaining her original hair. She still has her cowboy hat, but she now dresses in a pearl necklace, a bikini top, and tight Capri-length pants. She sometimes has a purple coat draped over her shoulders. She wore a pair of sandals (shoes later in the Post-War Saga in the anime), and now tends to wear shoes that can slip off easily so she can use her Sube Sube Spur technique with the slippery soles of her feet. She still wears lipstick, polish on her now shorter fingernails, and her toenails are shown painted as well (something that before was not visible before due to her shoes). During her appearance in Loguetown, she also had a cape-like, pink cloak with red hearts on it. Most people that see her actually fall in love with her (as seen in Loguetown, even women), similar to Boa Hancock. Delusional (or, most likely, in denial) about her former appearance, Alvida comments that theonly changeshe experienced after eating the Devil Fruit was simply that it \"made her freckles disappear\". After the timeskip, she replaced her cowboy hat with a red-and-white top hat, and capri pink pants.", "personality": "She sees herself as the most beautiful lady in all of the sea, even when she had a much more rotund and neglected appearance. If someone would disagree, she wouldsmash the offender with her iron mace. She does not like noise and dirty things, nor does she take to risking her life against overwhelming odds. She can be foreboding to men, especially subordinates, and is not afraid to put her foot down firmly on things that go against her interests. When pushed, she can be cruel above all else. Disliking filth and laziness, her crew was forced to clean the entire deck of her ship. If there is even a hint of dust, she wouldsmash thatpersonwith her club. Before she found and ate the Sube Sube no Mi, people used to say that she was the most beautiful woman in the world just to avoid getting hit by her iron club. After she ate her Devil Fruit, their comments became genuine thanks to her new beauty, even though Boa Hancock and the Mermaid Princess have also been called the most beautiful women in the world. After eating the Devil Fruit, she also underwent a personality change. She speaks in much softer tones and is somewhat less prone to hitting her crew with her iron mace, despite the fact that her men (and any other men) are too distracted by her appearance to care when they are hit by her mace.", "abilities_and_powers": "Initially, Alvida was only mildly formidable by East Blue standards. Though large and strong enough to captain her own crew and earn a minor bounty, she was quickly outfought and knocked unconscious by Luffy. She successfully landed only one blow, which was rendered completely ineffective by Luffy's rubber body and the angling of the spikes on her mace. Her intellect was also unremarkable and easily overtaken by her temper and vanity. Following her defeat by Luffy, she became noticeably more resourceful and judicious. With apparently no extrinsic help, she was able to navigate the East Blue and secure an alliance with Buggy, her coolheaded prudence counterbalancing his easily-excited crewmen."},

Around his neck is what appears to be a shirt collar with two buttons that have \"A\" on them, along with a red and maroon striped tie around his neck. He also has a dark yellow sash around his waist. He has three thin daggers on his right hip and is also seen carrying a sword in his left hand.", "personality": "Albion seemed calm when Caribou attacked the Marines but appeared annoyed by his attitude. Albion appears to be among the many others who were easily fooled by Fake Straw Hats' charade. Still, his desire to have his name known throughout the seas may have contributed to his decision to join Demaro Black's crew, as he did not question the dubious credibility of the fake Straw Hats. He quickly became angered upon realizing that his \"boss\" was a fake weakling, accusing the latter of taking advantage of the real Luffy, whom everyone thought to be dead, all the while considering Black to be a \"random piece of trash worth a mere 26 million\". As Sentomaru put it, Albion and the rest of the recruits were stupid for being so easily duped by the frauds.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about his abilities. It can be assumed that he is rather strong since he was able to make it all the way to Sabaody Archipelago and almost became a Supernova. He was also able to escape Sentomaru's platoon, when most of the other recruits were apprehended. He has at least four bladed weapons, so it might be assumed that he is a swordsman.

He was also able to treat Mjosgard's injuries after he came to Fish-man Island. Later, as the first mate of the Sun Pirates, his authority within the crew is second only to the captain's, Jinbe.

He wore a round white hat with a blue mark and had the muzzle of a lion stitched to his face, as well as long blond hair. Underneath his garments was a body stitched together from various animal parts. Absalom's skin was that of an elephant, and his muscles were a mixture of bear and gorilla. The combined weight of these transplants, along with his body, gave Absalom a total weight of 300 kilograms. These transplants on Absalom's body were all performed by Hogback.

He did not shy from the idea of sexual harassment and assault. Absalom sought women to be his bride, among other things, and particularly liked weak women who cannot fight back, such as Nami. He licked Nico Robin and spied on Nami while she was naked and taking a bath, in addition to holding her against her will; later attempting to kidnap her when she, Usopp, and Tony Tony Chopper were running away from Perona's animal zombies, successfully kidnapping her as she fled from Oars and the Mysterious Four, and forcing her to become his bride. All these perverted tendencies made him very similar to Sanji; they even react similarly to Nami's beauty while she was dressed in a wedding gown by mistaking her for a divine being. However, he was absolutely terrified of Lola because of her attraction to him, and is unwilling to marry a zombie. In addition, he is quite hypocritical about his perversion, having called Sanji a pervert for wanting his Devil Fruit powers in order to spy on women. When faced with matters not concerning his potential bride, Absalom exhibited a reasonably dedicated persona and is much more serious than Hogback and Perona. Like the other members of the Mysterious Four, he was devoted to Moria's ambition, though he often had to work very hard as his minion due to Moria's tendency to slack off and overall irresponsible behavior. Absalom's dream was to become the \"Graveyard King\" and rule over all of the graveyards in the world. Absalom often referred himself in plural in lines such as \"You will be our bride.\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Mysterious Four, Absalom had been given authority by Moria to control the zombies of Thriller Bark. In his case, he had the Soldier Zombies and General Zombies under his command prior to the fall of Thriller Bark. Though this did not necessarily mean that he was more powerful than any one of the Generals, it meant that Absalom still posed a significant threat to enemies of Thriller Bark due to his undead subordinates. His overall power is great enough that even zombies not under his direct command will obey him out of fear of his wrath."}

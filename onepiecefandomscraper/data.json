{"name": "Aramaki", "episode": "Episode 905", "chapter": "Chapter 882", "year": 2018, "note": "His alias, Ryokugyu, was first mentioned by Donquixote Doflamingo in Chapter 713. His real name was revealed in Chapter 1053.", "appearance": "Ryokugyu is a muscular man with thick and wild dark hair which reaches to his neck. He appears to be quite tall, as he looked comparable to fellow admiral Fujitora who stands at 2.7 meters. On his face, he has a somewhat pronounced nose and lips as well as a light goatee and sideburns; he has been shown smoking a cigarette. Ryokugyu does not wear a shirt, whereby exposing a large kanji tattoo \"\" (meaning \"double suicide at death river\"?) running down the left side of his chest. He wears a pair of dark-colored pants with light flower designs on the left leg, whereas the right leg has a few small tears. Additionally, he wears the standard Marine coat cape draped on his shoulders, which covers his otherwise bare back as well as a pair of sunglasses over his eyes.", "personality": "Ryokugyu is shown to act in a casual and uncouth manner, being unafraid of expressing his mind. With friends and allies, he has been shown to act quite jovial and conversational, as seen by his talk with fellow admiral Fujitora. With enemies, however, Ryokugyu has expressed open contempt much like his direct superior Sakazuki, whom he wishes to emulate out of admiration. Ryokugyu agrees with Sakazuki's principle of never holding back when battling enemies and is very much a follower of Absolute Justice. His Justice motto, accordingly, is called \"Determined Justice\" (, Shinuki no Seigi?). Ryokugyu has shown to be far more fanatical in his devotion to the World Government compared to the other admirals and even Sakazuki, believing that the World Nobles are gods. His worldview is that society functions best with a strict hierarchy system where those in power can act however they please against those deemed inferior. Thus, he believes he can do whatever he wants against countries unaffiliated with the World Government, up to and including genocide to fulfill its purpose. He has been seen expressing anger at people who unleash chaos in the world and make life difficult for the Marines, which has led to him developing a grudge against Monkey D. Luffy. Despite his loyalty, however, Ryokugyu is also extremely self-willed and will disregard or outright defy orders from his superiors in favor of doing what he feels is best. Although he admires Sakazuki, he did not follow the fleet admiral's order to remove Fujitora from Mary Geoise, seeing no point in the two of them doing battle. Later, despite Sakazuki telling the Marines to avoid Wano following Kaidou and Big Mom's downfall, Ryokugyu went to the country anyway to take down Luffy because he believed he could accomplish this and that he would gain Sakazuki's approval by killing the pirate. Ryokugyu even personally called in a battleship to aid him in his unapproved attack on Wano, an action which no other admiral has been shown doing for a personal mission. If he is doing something he should not be and is questioned about it, he has been shown to give vague answers to avoid being reprimanded, and when talking to subordinates he will order them to not inform his superiors about what he is doing. In combat, he is ruthless with great confidence in his own abilities, taking pride in his title of admiral and his Devil Fruit, to the point of despising those he easily defeats and believing himself to be invincible for being \"nature itself\". This is shown when he impaled many of the Beasts Pirates in a gruesome manner during his attack on them and kicked Queen several times after impaling him while mocking him and King in the process, referring to them as \"simple\" emperor commanders as they tried to resist, and adding that he would lose face if he was defeated. During his battle against the Red Scabbards, he pretended to feel pain from Raizo's attack only to taunt him and dehydrate him. This led to Momonosuke destroying his body shortly after, though he continued to taunt him. Ryokugyu does at least acknowledge the strength of his enemies (albeit in a begrudging fashion), stating that Kaidou's mere presence alone was enough to keep him and other enemies from attacking Wano, as well as stopping his assault on Momonosuke's group and leaving Wano after Shanks had attacked him with a burst of Haoshoku Haki from outside of Wano. Ryokugyu has abstained from eating for the last three years for unknown reasons. He also enjoys being around beautiful women and remarked to Fujitora that he would consider breaking his fast if an attractive woman were to feed him. Like many other characters, Ryokugyu laughs in a unique fashion: \"Rahaha\" (, Rahaha?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Ryokugyu's authority in the Marines is directly below the fleet admiral's, commanding authority over all lower-ranked personnel. He can command whole fleets, has a say in the overall strategy of the organization, and possesses the ability to issue special orders, like enacting a Buster Call at any time, while also granting those of lower status such an ability. In general, Ryokugyu can be assumed to hold a great deal of military leadership/coordination skills to be seen as qualified for his rank and the responsibilities that come with it. In battle, Ryokugyu, along with the other admirals, are thought to constitute the World Government's \"Greatest Military Power\" (i.e., the strongest individual fighters that the government can bring into action), making Ryokugyu one of the world's most powerful combatants. Both he and Fujitora were stated by Doflamingo to be known as powerful monsters among the Marines. Ryokugyu effortlessly defeated King and Queen, two All-Stars of the Beasts Pirates with bounties of over 1,000,000,000, and several of their subordinates. However, it is possible that the pirates had not fully recovered from the injuries they sustained during the Udon prison breakout and the Raid on Onigashima that had happened days earlier. Ryokugyu was able to single-handedly contend with a group consisting of Raizo, Shinobu, Inuarashi, Denjiro, Nekomamushi, Kawamatsu, Yamato, and Kozuki Momonosuke and held the advantage over them until the latter gained better control of his Devil Fruit powers. Another testament of Ryokugyu's power is that he defeated and arrested Edward Weevil, a powerful former Warlord. Ryokugyu possesses a strong will, being able to remain conscious after taking a powerful burst of Shanks' Haoshoku Haki from outside of Wano. Ryokugyu's physical prowess are immense, befitting his position as a marine admiral. Despite having not eaten in three years, he has remained completely healthy and not lacking in energy. It should be noted that he has been shown absorbing liquid into his body via his Devil Fruit, with water being a key source of nutrients for plants; as well as doing photosynthesis due to his Devil Fruit, enabling him to fast as long as he has sunlight and water around, giving him huge advantage in terms of survival. Ryokugyu is an extremely resilient man, capable of taking an advanced Haoshoku Haki attack from Yamato directly to the head, and while he confessed the attack hurt and was impressed with Yamato's level of Haki, he was unphased by the attack. Ryokugyu ate the Mori Mori no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into plant life. The plants he creates can be grown rapidly and moved around freely, seemingly not being limited by any rigidity that some plants, such as trees, normally possess. Notably, as plants are a solid element, he cannot turn intangible, though non-Haki attacks are still harmless to him, and he will regenerate from any damage. Interestingly, he regenerates by sprouting out of the ground and growing back into his normal self. Ryokugyu can generate large quantities of plants to unleash overwhelming large-scale attacks; when attacking the Beasts Pirates, he turned his fingers into sharpened tree branches and freely grew them to impale dozens of enemies over a large area with ease. Additionally, his plants can rapidly absorb any liquid they touch, which includes dehydrating living creatures after impaling them, leaving them as shrivelled husks. He appears to be able to taste the liquid he absorbs, as shown when he impaled a barrel of alcohol with a branch and remarked on its flavor. Ryokugyu can also perform highly unorthodox feats with the plants he generates, such as growing a giant flower on his back and using it to fly by spinning it rapidly like a propeller. It has also been shown that ordinary grass, trees and flowers grow in Ryokugyu's wake, on any surface he touches, resulting in him leaving behind a trail of plants wherever he walks. This was shown when Udon, which is known to be a barren and desolate area was shown with greenery for the first time in many years. It is currently unknown if this effect on his surroundings is passively active or something he does on purpose. As a marine admiral, Ryokugyu is a highly skilled Haki user. Ryokugyu is a highly skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. He is able to harden the tips of the branches he creates with his Devil Fruit powers. Ryokugyu is a highly skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki. He was able to sense the Red Hair Pirates miles outside of Wano Country after Shanks used his Haoshoku Haki. Ryokugyu carries around a shirasaya-like katana on his hip that does not appear to be in a sheath."},
{"name": "Aphelandra", "episode": "Episode 514", "chapter": "Chapter 408", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Aphelandra is an extremely tall woman. Her facial features are childlike, with wide dark brown eyes and long orange-brown hair falling evenly past her shoulders. She, like the rest of the Kuja, wears scanty attire. Her clothes consist of a blue corset bordered with yellow and studded with buttons, a similar blue bikini bottom, a white cape, and a plumed morion-type helmet with cheek guards and the Kuja emblem embossed on the front. For footwear, she wears dark brown outdoor boots. Her sword can be seen sheathed horizontally over her lower back, different from most sword-wielding characters seen in the series, who wear their swords on either hip.", "personality": "Despite her size, Aphelandra has shown to be rather timid, often repeating what others have said to her as she obeys their command. She is a kind and innocent woman. She even apologized to Luffy because she had to fight him for being a man. Aphelandra tends to respond to orders in a militaristic manner by suddenly standing straight and using a right-handed salute.", "abilities_and_powers": "Aphelandra is most likely a melee-type fighter where her prodigious size affords her a tremendous advantage over many foes. This large size worked to Luffy's disadvantage, who landed on (and bounced off) her chest during his escape from imprisonment. She was seen accompanying Boa Hancock on the Kuja pirate ship after the two-year timeskip, indicating that she has become strong enough to become part of the crew, since only the strongest warriors are allowed on the ship. Unlike many of the other Kuja, she does not use a snake bow as her weapon, instead using both her large size and a large jian sword she carries behind her to fight. It would seem that Aphelandra has yet to master the use of Haki (or at least Busoushoku Haki), since she was not able to significantly injure Luffy's elastic physiology after she struck him back to the ground with her bare arm. Seeing as how she is now considered strong enough to be part of the Kuja pirate crew, she might have improved her Haki during the time skip."},

He has a large nose and thin, black eyebrows. He wears a large, golden crown that has a maroon cap and a purple band studded with turquoise. He also wears a purple shirt, a magenta cap with a fluffy white collar, and jewelry around his neck. In the anime, he wears a pink neckerchief instead.", "personality": "Aruyutayan was a greedy and selfish king who was not above making rash decisions if it resulted in personal gains. He was ignorant to the challenges of seafaring, refusing to bring along Noland's experienced crew in favor of his kingdom's army, who otherwise had little experience at sea. Aruyutayan was also seemingly unfazed by losing most of his soldiers on the voyage, being driven primarily by his materialistic desires for Shandora. When he was denied the city he so much craved for, Aruyutayan was quick to think Noland had tricked him in spite of the latter's credibility as a hero and famous explorer. A major egocentric, Aruyutayan did not tolerate being made a fool of, using his authority as a royal to order not only Noland's execution, but also to carry out a post-mortem smear campaign that would lead to Noland's legacy being twisted into that of a goofy liar. Aruyutayan went as far as planting a fake witness to trick his subjects into despising the otherwise beloved Noland.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king of Lvneel Kingdom, Aruyutayan had command of its soldiers and the admiral Mont Blanc Noland."},

{"name": "Arlong", "episode": "Episode 69", "chapter": "Chapter 31", "year": 1999, "note": "", "appearance": "Arlong is a large, muscular, light blue saw-shark fish-man whose most distinctive trait is his saw-shaped nose. He has long, black hair reaching down to his shoulders and with a widow's peak. On his head, he wears a brown ushanka. He has a fin on his nape, surrounded by his hair, and his gills are located on both sides of his neck. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the left side of his chest, while his own Jolly Roger is on his left forearm. Other notable features include thin, fierce light-blue eyes and a long, angular jaw. Arlong's attire is composed of fashionable, light clothes, reflecting his rich status as well as his background as a thug. He wears a short-sleeved, unbuttoned yellow cabana shirt decorated by many black lightning-like spots, Bermuda shorts which are brown in the manga and green in the anime, a purple sash around the waist, and simple sandals. He also sports a lot of jewels: he has a golden chain bracelet around his left wrist and two golden bracelets around each ankle, with straw-like decorations hanging from them. On his hands are what appear to be rings, decorated by colorful gems. However, according to Oda in response to a fan about these rings, these aren't rings at all, but piercings that go straight through Arlong's fingers, as his hands are webbed and are incapable of wearing rings. As a member of the Sun Pirates, he wore an A-shirt, sometimes changed to a sleeveless, unbuttoned shirt decorated by flower-like motifs. He also wore a bowler hat and loose pants reaching down below his knees, first a light-colored pair with a line of similarly light spots on each leg's inner part, and later a similar pair, but darker in color and with spots on both sides of the legs. He already sported the straw decorations around his ankles and the sandals, and also donned a pair of large circular earrings. During his first raid on the Conomi Islands, he had a long, light green scarf hanging from his shoulders, a dark green coat, and a pair of beige Bermuda shorts with a chain-like pattern on them paired with a green sash around his waist. Also, instead of the ushanka he currently wears, he had a simple, dark grey hat on his head.", "personality": "Arlong considers humans to be inferior beings and is very cruel to them. He thinks nothing of killing a town full of humans, although he seems to prefer controlling people with money and deals (like Nami and Nezumi). Because of his love for money, he is known to be very cheap, as Hyouzou refused to join his crew because Arlong refused to compensate him for his service. He does not seem frightened by anything, and his fish-man strength made him extremely confident that he and his crew were virtually invincible. After Marine Captain Nezumi rejected his invitation for a drink out of fear of being seen in Arlong Park, Arlong simply offered to kill anyone who dared report him. He has an eye for spotting exploitable talent that he can use for his ambitions and is an excellent planner. He spent eight years using Nami and her maps to plan his conquest of the East Blue. Nevertheless, any promise about money he makes, he keeps. The best example is when his crew urged him to keep Nami even if she gathered 100,000,000. However, even though Arlong states he cannot go back on his word, he has no qualms about exploiting loopholes in his deals to get his way unfairly. He said he would free Nami's village if she brought him 100,000,000, but was more than willing to cheat her by having corrupt Marines confiscate her money to keep her in his services. He gets angry rather easily, as he nearly went on a rampage after being attacked by Usopp and had to be dragged back to his base by his crew to prevent him from destroying Cocoyasi Village. During his fight with Luffy, the boy's constant fighting back made Arlong deeply angry. Arlong had expected Luffy to die quickly, but his anger made him reckless and destructive, causing him to seriously damage his own headquarters and map collection while attacking Luffy. He has been ill-tempered since his younger years. However, he was not always entirely brutal. During a battle with the Marines, Arlong told Jinbe to leave the unconscious Marines alone. However, he became more arrogant over time, to the point that he completely lost any sympathy for humans. The circumstances behind Fisher Tiger's death led to his hatred of the human race greatly intensifying. He also failed to understand Tiger's reason for letting humans that they attacked live. As a result, when Arlong led his own crew and committed murder, humans came to view him as a monster. In the end, he enslaved humans just as the humans once enslaved many fish-men. Though his opinions and ideals were extreme, he displayed a high level of brotherhood with his crew and even towards Nami despite the divide between their species. Arlong looked after his subordinates, and even though he betrayed Nami, he did so because he did not want to lose her talent. On top of this, in the final moments of the battle with Luffy, he stated that Nami was his crewmate and would be forever, and while he never displayed any regard for her as a friend, he was prepared to fight to keep her in the crew. If humans insulted their group, Arlong would become enraged, resulting in officers attempting to keep his temper under control. When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek revenge on those responsible. He cared for his crew to a level that when Luffy used one of them as a shield, Arlong became extremely angry. Ironically, Arlong is a hypocrite, having accused Koala of being raised to look down on fish-men and think of humans as better than everyone else, when Arlong looked down on humans and preached fish-men superiority himself, making him no better than the humans. According to Hatchan, despite his hatred of humanity, Arlong would never harm his fellow fish-men no matter the circumstance. For all his talk about how Fish-men were the superior race and his own strength, Arlong was nothing more than a coward. After suffering a brutal defeat at the hands of Vice Admiral Borsalino and later Jinbe, Arlong, knowing he's no match in the Grand Line, fled to the East Blue, the weakest of the seas to set up his organization there to ensure he would never lose again. He lazily never bothered to train himself and just bullied Nami and her people to make himself feel superior and bribed the Marines to ensure Jinbe never found out solely to take the easy way out of not dealing with another defeat from Jinbe. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Shahahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Arlong Pirates, Arlong had full authority over his crew. His power was remarked to be greater than Don Krieg, the strongest military force in the East Blue, with only Krieg's military might and massive armada forcing the Marines to deem him the bigger threat. Arlong was not intimidated by Luffy's Devil Fruit powers and quickly took advantage of his weakness to the effects of the sea. With the Marines focusing their attention on the Grand Line and the incapacitation of all other major East Blue pirate bands by the Straw Hats, there would have been nothing to stop them from taking over East Blue if the Straw Hat Pirates had not intervened. As a fish-man, he is physically ten times stronger than a common human, and even more so underwater. However, he seems to possess amazing physical strength even for fish-man standards. He lifted a house with his bare hands in pursuit of Usopp, and his powerful shark-like jaws are capable of shattering metal, crushing stone, and ripping through flesh alike. He is incredibly resilient, which allowed him to withstand most of Luffy's attacks. Although Luffy unleashed several of his techniques and forced Arlong back, he was mostly unfazed after each attempt. He also has an incredible resistance to pain. During his fight with Luffy, he ripped off many sets of his rapidly re-growing teeth, and he rearranged his broken nose without a grimace. Arlong is also capable of entering a kind of berserk mode upon being angered. When this happens, his eyes take on an appearance similar to those of Sea Kings. While in this state, both his strength and his speed grow exponentially, making him far more dangerous than previously stated. Arlong's weapons are mostly natural features of his saw-shark fish-man body. He was also seen killing Bell-mre with a flintlock pistol. Arlong's nose is over a foot long, lined with razor-sharp edges, and more than sturdy enough to use as a melee weapon. By swinging his head back and forth, Arlong defeated Zoro (who was weakened by the wound given to him by Mihawk and his fight with Hatchan) in a sword fight. He is very proud of his nose, which he claims is unbreakable. His nose's durability is particularly evident by the fact that he flew directly into the concrete of Arlong Park without damaging it, causing others to look on in shock and comment on its toughness. However, Luffy managed to bend his nose during their fight. Arlong then twisted it back to its original position without any noticeable pain or discomfort. Arlong can remove his massive teeth and use them like hand-held bear traps. The teeth are replaced by a new set-in mere moments, with each regrown set of teeth being stronger than the one before. Luffy demonstrated, however, that these teeth can also be used against Arlong, either by holding them in his hands or fitting them in his mouth and biting his opponent with them. However, Arlong states that only a fish-man can fully utilize the strength of the teeth as he possesses stronger jaw muscles than a human. In the last phases of his fight with Luffy, he used his signature giant serrated blade, the Kiribachi, with great proficiency, as he was able to cut even a building with it. He had the weapon since his younger days, as he was already seen wielding it during his time in the Sun Pirates."},

Just like Itomimizu, Chuchun wears a striped tuque that covers half of his head with holes for the eyes in it. In the manga the holes are triangular, matching the masks of all Foxy Pirates members. In the anime they have a more rounded shape and the dark stripes of the tuque are blue.", "personality": "Chuchun makes a \"chyu\" kind of sound but has not displayed any outstanding personality traits. He got excited about the start of the final round of the Davy Back Fight and he made a concerned face when Foxy got K.O.ed by Luffy which shows that he's at least intelligent enough to understand the situation. The latter may even indicate a certain degree of loyalty towards his captain.", "abilities_and_powers": "Chuchun has no special powers apart from his natural ability to fly. But he is strong enough to carry one person on his back and is smart enough to fly without his rider's directions as seen by how Itomimizu was not seen actively steering him."},

He appeared to be a friendly, kind, and helpful person who lived for honor and was ready to sacrifice himself to protect others. Later, this was all proven to be a facade. In reality, Cyrano was an unscrupulous and dishonest criminal. Manipulative and immoral, he would murder others if it served his self-interest, and even sacrifice his own comrades to achieve his goals. Along with his partner, D.R., they both put up a false front of honorable individuals in order to earn trust of others before they commit criminal activities. Cyrano was also very overconfident and arrogant, believing his status as a first-class swordsman and his fraudulent honor made him superior to Ryuma, and mocked the samurai constantly during their confrontation, which led Cyrano to a swift death.", "abilities_and_powers": "Cyrano was noted to be a first-class swordsman, and the fact that Ryuma was able to slay him in one simple strike made D.R. question in fear what happened. Cyrano's choice of weapon was a zweihnder. Cyrano proved himself to be quite manipulative and cunning, as he pretended to rescue Flare in order to build some prestige for himself, so he could later rob a town without being suspected. He even had Ryuma framed to have him become a scapegoat, furthering his own securities. However, his heavy underestimation of the samurai led to his downfall."},

However, once he became a pirate, he became crueler and started physically abusing Drake. Barrels was quite naive, setting up a deal to sell the Ope Ope no Mi to the Marines. He did, however, realize the fruit's potential, despite not wanting it for himself, though he did not know of the ability to grant immortality; Doflamingo regarded him as a fool for not knowing the true value of the fruit's powers. His greed for monetary value made him focus more on retrieving the fruit when it was stolen by Donquixote Rosinante than tending to his own injuries.", "abilities_and_powers": "Barrels' physical abilities are unknown, but he likely has proficient strength, as he had already made a name for himself, though he was no match for Doflamingo."},

Ace in Chapter 440.", "appearance": "Dadan is a rather tall and overweight middle aged woman with long, orange, curly hair and a big, masculine face. In her appearance in Luffy's flashback, she was seen smoking a cigarette. She wears a white collar shirt, a pink beaded necklace, chequered trousers held up with a large belt, and heeled boots. After ten years, her outfit changed to a black shirt with a light-colored open coat over it, and two years after that, the colors became inverted; otherwise, her appearance has not changed over the years. In her youth, Dadan was once a very beautiful woman, being much thinner with a curvier body outline. She wore a one piece dress.", "personality": "As far as personality goes, Dadan's is that of a somewhat stereotypical petty criminal, a bit cowardly in regards to Garp blackmailing her, her freedom, and Garp himself. She also does not seem to be too patient as she was beginning to get sick and tired of raising Ace because of his antics and became even more aggravated when she was left with Luffy. Though despite this petty side, the other mountain bandits hold great respect for her, and will follow her orders even into a deadly fight. The methods that she supposedly used to \"discipline\" both Luffy and Ace were rather questionable (though Luffy seemed to be able to easily put up with them on account that the treatment he received under his own grandfather, Garp, was hardly any better) since they included providing them with limited food, making them clean the house, hunting for them, and even resort to criminal activities (i.e. plundering people). However, judging from Luffy and Ace's regard for her whenever she was mentioned, she may have been a better person than anyone might have thought of her. She has also been known to show brief signs of bravery, as seen when she and her family of bandits came to rescue Ace and Luffy from Bluejam; only to scamper immediately afterwards upon securing the two boys' safety. Although she says that she hates brats, she appears to really care for Luffy and Ace like they were her own children but seems too embarrassed to admit it. In the anime, this is later proven true when Ace, Sabo, and Luffy decided to leave the bandits cottage and make a hideout of their own. At first she tried to show that she did not care, but once it started raining heavily, she ordered the bandits to go look for them. When they finally did, she went and visited them secretly during the night, only to be hit out of the boy's hideout from a trap that they had built. Upon learning of Ace's death, Dadan was extremely distressed, mostly at the thought of how much Luffy would be hurting over the loss of Ace. She was upset enough to even attack and beat up Garp, someone whom she was usually deathly afraid of, further demonstrating her hidden concern towards the boys. Dadan even shed tears at Sabo's presumed fate, as she previously learned of his survival.", "abilities_and_powers": "Dadan is the mountain bandit boss of the Dadan Family, and has command over the gang. Their reputation is quite notorious, as according to Garp, they committed more crimes than the stars. She, along with Ace, were powerful enough to defeat the infamous pirate Bluejam. She managed to hold a young, enraged Ace down and subdue him, despite being injured. She was also able to physically injure Garp, though that was most likely because the Vice Admiral voluntarily did not defend himself. Dadan's weapon appears to be a long handled axe, which she is fairly proficient with, able to hold back a powerful captain such as Bluejam in one blow. While she had attacked Garp, she used a wooden club as a weapon."},

His lower lip is noticeably larger than his upper. He wears a pink shirt with a yellow and green stripe with purple circles in the yellow along with blueish-grey shorts with sandals. He also wears glasses, a seaweed necklace, three gold bracelets, and a green-gem bracelet on his left wrist. He also has a scar on his left arm. 24 years ago, he had black hair, with yellow parts sticking out resembling a flower. His face was less wrinkled, and he wore a pink hat with black spots on it. He did not have a beard, but instead just had stubble. As a member of the Roger Pirates, he wore a pink sleeveless shirt, dark pink hat, and carried harpoons on his back. His beard and hair were still black, and he seemed to be more muscular. After the time skip, he has basically the same clothes, but with a new dark colored shirt with pictures on it.", "personality": "Crocus is a wise and caring man. He has a strange habit of taking his time when it comes to answering questions. He once took a direct hit from a cannon attack by Mr. 9 in order to protect Laboon, showing that he deeply cares about the whale. He strongly values friendship, as despite decades of separation with the Rumbar Pirates, Crocus had joined the Roger Pirates to search for its members in order to help Laboon reunite with them. As a member of the Roger Pirates, Crocus readily supported them from fighting to giving medical treatments. Crocus is shown to be strict when it comes to healthcare as he berated Roger for his excessive drinking despite having a terminal illness. Crocus also forbid Buggy from traveling with them to Laugh Tale due to his sudden high fever despite his desperate pleas.", "abilities_and_powers": "Crocus is an extraordinary doctor, one of the finest medical specialists in the world. According to Rayleigh, Crocus was the only doctor who could halt the deterioration of Gol D. Roger's incurable disease, prolonging the latter's life long enough to reach Laugh Tale and conquer the Grand Line. Crocus is a capable pharmacist, developing effective medicine on his own and supplying large quantities for Roger so he could use it on himself to live out the remainder of his lifespan. He also developed a tranquilizer that works on even Laboon, a 400 meter long whale. Moreover, Crocus is an outstanding surgeon as he was able to surgically modify Laboon to install routes in his body, facilitating medical treatment for the whale. Crocus is a capable fighter, having participated in the battle between Roger and Shiki's respective crews, as well as the Whitebeard Pirates 26 years ago. He tends to use harpoons as his choice of weapons, and his strength alone is enough to defeat large sea creatures. He has also been shown to have either a high pain tolerance and durability as he has taken direct hits from Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday's bazookas while defending Laboon even in his old age, showing no signs of damage just moments afterward. Crocus possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Curiel is one of the gutsier commanders as he challenged a Warlord and, later, an Admiral by himself during the war.", "abilities_and_powers": "As commander of the 10th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Curiel has authority over the pirates in his division. He seems to be quite well known, as Warlord Gecko Moria knew who he was when the two encountered each other on the battlefield. He is also quite durable, as he was able to survive a powerful direct hit from Akainu's magma-based Devil Fruit. He appears to specialize in firearms and is proficient in using the guns and bazookas he is armed with, as he was able to single-handedly confront the Warlord Gecko Moria and later emerge unharmed. He has at least two bazookas and two guns. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, the two guns are shown to have rapid-fire capabilities, as Curiel was able to quickly destroy all of Moria's Brick Bats with a single barrage of bullets, which also shows that Curiel possesses great accuracy.

As a Longarm, he has unusually long arms, with an extra elbow joint on each. He wears a dark suit with a giant pink bowtie, dark pants, and a dark mask over his eyes. When he was taken to the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout, he was forced to change his clothes into a lighter suit.", "personality": "Diesel is very loyal to Big Mom, as he massacred several people to get mythical flour for her, and immediately went to report Brle's defeat to her.

{"name": "Dorry", "episode": "Episode 116", "chapter": "Chapter 71", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Dorry is a well-built giant with a long beard. He generally dresses in a viking attire with a helmet that goes over his eyes. He is so large that Luffy can fit in the palm of his hand. He is 160 years old, which means that he is a giant in the prime of his life.", "personality": "Dorry is a good-natured giant, though his pride can sometimes cloud him from making the best judgement calls. He firmly believes in the customs from his homeland and follows them with great honor, even doing so while severely wounded. Due to his pride, he rushed into the conclusion that Luffy was responsible for the bomb in his drink, seeing that he and Vivi were the only ones around (to his knowledge, at least). Like many characters in One Piece, Dorry has a unique laugh, starting his with \"Gegya\" (i.e. Gegyagyagyagya!).", "abilities_and_powers": "Dorry has a bounty of 100,000,000 on his head, an indication of his danger. Moreover, like other giants, he possesses superhuman strength and resistance. However, having been one of the two captains of the Giant Warrior Pirates, he was extremely strong even compared to the other individuals of his race and had authority over one of the strongest crews in the world. As a demonstration of his strength, he fought on a par with Brogy for a hundred years and together with the latter he managed to defeat such great creatures that not even the other giants of their crew would have been able to capture. The strength of the two giants is in fact such that Galdino, a member of Baroque Works who is capable of defeating a pirate with a bounty of 42,000,000, said he could in no way defeat them without resorting to deception, even with the help from Miss Golden Week, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. Dorry is also capable of easily killing the dinosaurs of Little Garden, prey he hunts daily. Together with Brogy he also managed to pierce the Island Eater, despite the great distance that separated them. Even Luffy, after seeing them perform this feat, stated that the two were monstrously powerful. Dorry also survived a barrel of liquor that exploded inside his stomach, and still managed to fight Luffy. The latter also, when Dorry intended to fight him and Vivi ran away, stated that it would have made no sense to run away in front of an opponent like him. Dorry's defeat by Luffy's hand is in fact partly to be attributed to the serious conditions in which the giant was living, as well as the fact that the latter had underestimated the pirate. Later, despite all the injuries he suffered, also managed to immobilize Luffy himself and fight with Brogy, eventually being defeated by the latter only because of Galdino, who with his powers had benefited his rival. Dorry fights with a shield and a long sword. His previous sword was called the Terry Sword, but after a hundred years of battle, the blade lost its sharpness and eventually broke. Dorry later replaced it with new sword. By using a sword he can launch a Flying Slash Attack, powerful enough to kill the Island Eater."},

{"name": "Diamante", "episode": "Episode 700", "chapter": "Chapter 629", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Diamante wears a light-colored hat with brown locks of hair coming down from it. He has striped, orange and red rectangular streaks that run down from his forehead, through his eyes, straight to his chin. In the digitally colored manga, he wears a pink shirt with purple pants and a crimson cape made of steel, while in the anime, Diamante dons a light-colored shirt with brighter red pants that match his cape. He is an extremely tall and thin man, noticeably larger than his 10-foot-tall captain, Doflamingo, and possesses a muscular upper body. He possesses a slight hunchback. His legs are especially long, protruding out right next to his face when he sits down. In the anime, he was given blue eyes. As a child, he wore an old and worn pirate hat which covered up his forehead, a large robe, a tattered tank top, and striped pants. Ten years ago, during the takeover of Dressrosa, the streaks on his face were not present.", "personality": "Every time someone says something flattering or good about Diamante, he denies it until the person flattering him stops. That is when he accepts the compliment and believes that the person praising him had offered his or her unbiased opinion about his talents. However, Diamante holds his status as the \"Hero of the Colosseum\" in very high regard, boasting about how he had surpassed Kyros in terms of skill and fame. He is also very cruel, as he spoke to Bellamy extremely harshly after he was beaten in the Colosseum. During the usurpation of the Riku Family, he was smiling during the burning down of the castle, indicating his joy during the event. This attitude extends to all recruits, even children, as he shows them little respect. Diamante also is rather insensitive and monstrous as he bluntly told Viola that he killed her sister and even laughed in her face about the act. This insensitivity is shown again when he informed Rebecca about her mother's death on top of mocking her father for his sorrow over her loss; he also called Rosinante lacking in intelligence and concentration right in his face. Despite this, he has no tolerance for anyone who mocks his crew, whom he sees as family members, being visibly infuriated and stunned when a foot soldier laughed at Pica's high pitch voice. Diamante does not seem to give in to popular opinion as he remained steadfast in declaring Rebecca the winner of block D when some other gladiators tried to attack her, showing at least fair sportsmanship. He also believes one must be honest with money, telling Rosinante to hand over the earnings from his job. However, he is willing to use underhanded tricks to gain the upper hand when he feels necessary, such as targeting Rebecca to create an opening while fighting Kyros or shooting Kyros in the leg while he is distracted by the rain of steel spiked balls. Like many One Piece characters, Diamante has a distinct laugh: \"Uhahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Diamante occupies the Diamond seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Diamante Army, with Lao G, Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger, all of whom specialized as a fighter brigade, as his subordinates. As the former proprietor of the Corrida Colosseum, he was in charge of all the goings-on in the building. He was also known as the \"Hero of the Colosseum\" on Dressrosa, for which Doflamingo held him in high regard. Doflamingo trusted Diamante enough to fight all of the block winners in the tournament alone, as the fighter brigade that he commanded had been sent away to complete various tasks. This implies that Doflamingo has enough confidence in Diamante's strength and abilities to at least compete against, if not defeat, Jesus Burgess, Bartolomeo, Rebecca, and Lucy by himself. Even as a 14-year-old, Diamante was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Trebol and Pica, all of whom were children. At 35 years old, Diamante, along with Trebol and Pica, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Alongside Trebol, Diamante defeated the dozens of ex-toys who tried to destroy the SMILE Factory without even receiving a single injury. Diamante is able to recognize Haki, as he noted the clash between Luffy's Haki and Don Chinjao's. Even at 14-year-old, he was already knowledgeable of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki have the qualities of a king. Diamante is extremelystrong, as he can constantly carry his steel cape, which is dense enough to withstand attacks from fighters as powerful as Kyros and not show any sign of strain. His great strength allows him to create slashes of compressed air by simply swinging his sword, leaving deep fissures in the ground from very long distances. He is resilient, having quickly recovered from one of Kyros' sword strikes, but has a notable weak point on his forehead, which he covers with his hat at all times. Diamante ate the Hira Hira no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to bestow the properties of fabric onto his own body, as well as any non-living thing he touches. The affected material becomes completely flat, flexible, and foldable; even hardened metal flutters like a flag in the breeze at his command. While anything Diamante touches gains the malleable properties of cloth fabric, all other natural characteristics, such as toughness, strength, or sharpness, are retained by the material, so metal objects can still resist forceful impact from enemies and blades retain their edge. He can also creatively fold and reshape the flattened items into different forms and shapes, granting him a wider variety of options in combat. By using his power on his metal weapons, he can make them flexible like a whip, allowing him to attack his opponent at abstract angles that they are unprepared to defend and counter from. He can also make them flat so as to easily keep them concealed until he needs them. Diamante is highly skilled at swordsmanship, and a competent teacher, considering that he was the one who taught sword skills to a young Trafalgar Law, who is a skilled swordsman himself. His abilities are great enough for him to evenly match Kyros, the previous, undefeated winner of the Corrida Colosseum, even managed to push his opponent back at one point. Diamante wears a steel block for a cape, which he uses in tandem with his Devil Fruit powers to make it flutter while maintaining its steel quality for defense, capable of snapping cutlasses and injuring enemies who rush into it. For offense, he wielded a flintlock handgun to kill Rebecca's mother Scarlett and attempted to do the same for Rebecca while also injuring Kyros, a rapier, which he can also use his fruit's powers to make it flutter, reshaping it into other shapes for attack, and a club he keeps folded using his fruit's powers, and can then unfold and make it regain its shape to attack. He can also utilize this increase in flexibility to bend his sword at lengthened and unsuspecting angles. He also carried confetti blasters to release spiked iron balls and an iron umbrella to protect himself from them, all of which he can easily hide on his body via his ability. Diamante possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He had golden-blonde hair, pale skin (tanner in the manga, much like his brother), and sharp, reddish-brown eyes. He was seen wearing a dark red hood from which two heart-like shapes hang from, a pair of beige jeans (white in the anime), a dark purple feather mantle much like his brother and a white shirt with pink hearts printed all over it. He also wears mismatched shoes. His hair was styled longer than his brother's, as it came close to his eyes. Rosinante had tattoos (or makeup) over his eyes and mouth. He was also seen wearing sunglasses, though he did throw away with these upon his six-months journey with Law. During his childhood, Rosinante had his hair in an unkempt fashion, covering his eyes. Prior to leaving Mary Geoise, he wore the typical garb of the Celestial Dragons, and had his hair in the same style as his older compatriots. After leaving, his hairstyle changed and he had wardrobe consisted of simple yet fine clothes with a frilled cravat that became very ragged due to the uneasy lifestyle he had to endure. Suffering from torture at the hands of the locals who hated the Celestial Dragons, as well as other battles, left scars and stitches all over his body. Upon joining the Marines, Rosinante wore the standard cadet uniform, minus the makeup/tattoos he has when working as a spy.", "personality": "When Trafalgar Law first met with Rosinante, Rosinante was noted for hating kids, especially when Baby 5 and Buffalo played practical jokes on him, such as making him slip upon passing through the doorway or giving him scalding tea that burned his tongue, resulting in his abusive behavior towards them. In fact, the first thing that Rosinante did to Law was to grab him and throw him out the window. This was actually part of an act, however, as it was his duty as a Marine to dissuade children from joining the crew, which he failed with Baby 5, Buffalo, Dellinger and Law. Despite his outward behavior of a violent man who dislikes children, he genuinely inherited his father's kindness (something Doflamingo himself admits) believing that his elder brother is a monster born evil and only acted cruel to children in the hopes of driving them away from following Doflamingo. He cared deeply for his birth family as he wept for his mother's death and cried when his brother was shot with an arrow. From his kindness, he did not possess any manners of a typical Celestial Dragon, and saw it his duty to stop his brother's madness, a sense of justice that led him to join the Marines as an undercover spy. Because of this, Rosinante was shown to be forgiving since he did not hold any grudge against Law for stabbing him in the back and even kept quiet about his transgression. When Law revealed his true name, he showed genuine concern and worry, even warning him about the danger that he was in. He was capable of compassion as he went as far as to go out of his way with both his brother and the Marines to take Law throughout the North Blue to find a doctor to cure the boy's disease and flew into violent rages whenever the doctors caved into prejudice due to their incorrect belief that Law was a walking contagious disease who should not have survived the extermination of Flevance. In spite of his extreme methods, due to his empathy and courage, he appears to follow his own ideals instead of adhering to the Marines' doctrine of Absolute Justice. He was believed to be incapable of speech due to a prior accident and, according to Diamante, was unintelligent and cannot concentrate. However, this was merely a faade and he was fully capable of speaking, as well as being perfectly intelligent, as seen by his playing on how the others perceive him. Upon hearing Law's full name, knowing the importance of the initial \"D.\", he was forced to break his silence, showing more perception than what his comrades believed. Although his mutism and dislike for children were mere acts to hide his true self, the one attribute that was genuine was his clumsiness, easily falling for Baby 5 and Buffalo's pranks and constantly tripping himself. He was also seen smoking, though due to his clumsiness, he accidentally set his own cowl aflame every time he tried to light a cigarette.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being born in the Donquixote Family, Rosinante was a World Noble, thus granting him political rights and privileges to do almost anything he pleased, as well as near limitless wealth and the ability to summon a Marine Admiral to strike down anyone who offended him. When his father forfeited the status of a World Noble for the family, he lost such privileges. Rosinante was undoubtedly a powerful fighter, being capable of taking Vergo's place as an executive officer in the Donquixote Pirates, where even Diamante acknowledged his fighting prowess. He was second-in-command of the many other officers and soldiers of the crew, alongside the other executive officers, and just under Doflamingo himself. As a Marine commander, he had command over all lower ranking soldiers, but he may have had more authority as he was a double agent who reported directly to an admiral. Rosinante was noted to be unintelligent and lacking in concentration as well as being very clumsy as he fell for both of Buffalo and Baby 5's pranks and setting his own cape on fire while trying to light a cigarette. However, Diamante stated he was nevertheless talented enough to become an officer, possibly due to his lineage. As with his mutism, it was an act that showed off his power of deception, as Rosinante was actually intelligent enough to even deceive his crew by hiding his true self and Devil Fruit powers in order to spy on them, as well as being aware that anyone with the D initial should not be anywhere near Doflamingo. However he was shown to be clumsy anyways, as it is his nature. Rosinante has extraordinary endurance and durability from withstanding the torture from angry civilians even as a child, and simply sat unflinching for a while after being stabbed deep in the back by Law before tending to the wound later that day. In his usual clumsiness of falling down and setting himself on fire, Rosinante was completely unfazed by the damage he suffered, showing incredible pain tolerance. He managed to move and sneak away with Law even after having been shot multiple times by the Barrels Pirates and brutally beaten by Vergo with Haki enhanced strikes, although Vergo made it clear that he was not trying to kill them; to later be beaten by the Donquixote Pirates. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, while being seriously injured, Rosinante was still tenacious enough to run at high speed to evade Gladius's gunshots and Diamante's Vipera Glaive as well as the agile martial art master Lao G's punches. Moreover, he could withstand Trebol's explosive Beta Launcher, Pica's brutal crush grip in his massive golem form, and a hard hit from Diamante's bat and was later viciously kicked by Gladius in a furious rage. Concludes non-canon section. After being fatally shot by his older brother multiple times in a badly injured state, Rosinante hung on to life through sheer willpower long enough for Law to escape under the influence of his power. Rosinante possessed a fair amount of physical strength and agility. Being able to seriously injure several doctors with a few blows. He was also able to knock out Diez Barrels with a single kick, with enough force to free the Ope Ope no Mi from his hand, then felled some of his men, later escaping, albeit with an initial stumble, with the fruit of the devil. Rosinante ate the Nagi Nagi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to nullify sounds. While this power lacked any direct combat applications, it still granted him a number of benefits. He was able to carry out covert operations without making a sound, and he could report the status of his operation and have private conversations without the risk of being overheard, something that proved incredibly useful for his position as an undercover Marine informant. He could also deceive people into thinking he was mute, and he could use his power to help him sleep. He was able to manifest an invisible soundproof field around himself and others. Anyone inside perimeter of this field could not hear the sounds from the outside and vice versa. He could also cancel out all sounds within a certain distance of him, allowing him to do things that would normally immediately attract attention, such as fire cannons and cause explosions. While the sounds of these actions were nullified, other noticeable outcomes of his actions, such as the shockwave from an explosion or light from fires, could still be perceived normally. Rosinante could also use the lack of sounds to cause confusion among his enemies, as they would be used to relying on their sense of hearing, and thus would not be used to things being so quiet. Using this power, he was able to break into a mansion filled with pirates, blow it up, and escape with a Devil Fruit without being noticed. Rosinante was shown using a bazooka while demonstrating his Devil Fruit ability to Law at Minion Island. Later, he was seen using a flintlock pistol to destroy some lamps at Diez Barrels' hideout. He was also equipped with explosives, which he used against Barrels' crew after obtaining the Ope Ope no Mi. In his final moments, Rosinante aimed the pistol at his brother, though was unable to pull the trigger."},

Like other members of the Beasts Pirates, he looks down on the lower-class people of Wano. He is also prone to underestimating and condescending people even when he has heard about their feats of strength, as he believed that Luffy only defeated Urashima by luck. He seems to be quick to jump to conclusions, as he believed that Luffy, Zoro, and Kikunojo were accomplices of the thief Shutenmaru after simply seeing Luffy's display of strength.

Kamijiro possesses great strength in his paws and jaw, with Holed'em stating that he could easily crush Tama with the latter. However, Kamijiro has a mind of his own, putting Holed'em at risk of being attacked by him. However, damage dealt by the lion will also hurt him, as he shares the same body as Holed'em. Holed'em carries a long sword with a star-shaped guard, he calls his blade the Karakuri Sword. He is seemingly proficient in using it, as he was confident in its power when attacking Luffy. However, he was unable to use it before Luffy took him out.

{"name": "Hody Jones", "episode": "Episode 608", "chapter": "Chapter 527", "year": 2010, "note": "He was officially introduced in Chapter 611.", "appearance": "Hody is a grey-skinned great white shark fish-man. He had a large belly, with a tattoo of the New Fish-Man Pirates design on the right side as well as a long scar on the left, and muscular arms and legs. His facial features include glaring eyes, with long and distinctive eyelashes, a mouth full of sharp, triangular teeth, and a stub nose. He had long black curly hair, with a long tuft hanging on the left part of his face. His left arm is intricately tattooed, with the Arlong Pirates' Jolly Roger near the wrist and several circular designs above it ending with two skulls on the upper arm; he also has some spikes protruding from his bare wrist and circling it all, possibly decorative piercings. His brief fight with Zoro left him with a new scar that appears to start below his left shoulder and goes down his chest diagonally to the right, similar to the one Dracule Mihawk gave Zoro. He sported a pink newsboy cap, with a little trident represented on the left side, bearing a resemblance to the same weapon he was sometimes seen carrying around, and a massive scarf seemingly made from a dog-like animal around his neck, with the animals head hanging on the left side of his chest. Hody was seen wearing a red open shirt with short sleeves, a wide collar and dark-red spots on the lower part, short blue trousers with a similar pattern but with light-blue spots, a pink sash tied around the waist, and sandals. After overdosing himself on Energy Steroids, Hody underwent a drastic change in appearance: he no longer had a large belly, being far more muscular than before, with his muscles bulging in size with thick veins appearing, particularly on his arms, and his size greatly increased, being in equal in size to Ikaros Much, the largest of the New Fish-Man Pirates, while sitting down. His dark hair had lightened exponentially. He no longer wore any headgear, and donned a shirt with the colors reversed from the one he originally wore, with the dark background having turned light and the light spots along the bottom having turned dark. He also carried his trident on his back. As Noah continued to descend on Fish-Man Island and Hody's hatred grew stronger, the sclera turned red and he was seen with an enlarged jaw about the size of Luffy (though in the anime it was because he consumed more Energy Steroids). He also appears to have grown so much muscle mass that his shirt ripped apart as a result. It is later shown after he is defeated that during his last fight with Luffy that he gained enough muscle mass that he is now the size of the royal princes. By the time of his defeat and capture, the crew noted that Hody looked like a monster. After being defeated and imprisoned, another side effect of the Energy Steroid kicked in- the shortening of the user's lifespan relative to the number of steroids consumed. Unfortunately for Hody, his (and his fellow officers') Energy Steroid abuse has resulted in all of them becoming old and frail- and Hody's appearance has changed into that of an old man's, considerably more aged than his subordinates due to taking an especially large quantity of the steroids. His hair remained white, and nearly all the hair on his upper scalp fell out, causing him to become bald, except for the curled hair that hangs below his neck, which remained intact. He grew a mustache, as well as a goatee several inches long, and his skin wrinkled. He also became incredibly skinny, losing all of his muscle and some of his teeth with the remaining teeth now square instead of sharp, and has become hunched over on bent knees now having to walk with a cane. As a teenager, he had less sharp facial features, shorter hair, and a leaner build. He wore a newsboy cap with the word \"CHECK\" imprinted on it and a simple scarf paired with an open dark vest decorated by two sword-like motifs on the front.", "personality": "Hody is a racist, overly hypocritical, prideful, brutal, and vicious natured fish-man who, like many of his kind, hates humans for leaving Fisher Tiger to die when he could have been saved (which was not true, as Tiger refused human blood due to being betrayed). He proves this by attacking humans within his reach. He, like Arlong, believes that fish-men are the supreme race, demonstrating his arrogance by attacking Gyro's crew with his hands cuffed, showing them that they could easily be destroyed even with the handicap. He then deliberately released the crew, injured but alive, setting them as examples, telling them to spread the word of the New Fish-Man Pirates. Despite the fact that they both looked down on humans, his treatment of humans is even more brutal than Arlong's. He considers his human captives to be expendable and sees them as nothing more than pawns whereas Arlong had left humans alone so long as they paid him \"tribute\" money periodically. Arlong mainly killed humans to make examples of them when they did not pay up and was content with leaving them be, aside from odd acts to make sure the humans knew who was boss, but Hody will go out of his way to attack humans, such as using them as part of his plan that will almost ensure their deaths, and threatening to kill them outright if they refuse, giving them very little chance to live altogether. Hody basically grew up basking in the hatred of fish-men towards humanity. He and his crew would hate and fear the day when the animosity between humans and fish-men would fade. This leads Hody and his crew to become bloodthirsty radicals who do not care for the peace of Fish-Man Island. Hody himself believes that heaven has selected him and his crew to hand judgement down to humanity, in spite of the fact that humans did utterly nothing against Hody personally. From his point of view, hatred towards humans is his definition of pride. Hody despises anyone who wants peace with humans especially Otohime, claiming that her preaching was aggravating and he did everything in his power to keep her hopes and dreams from becoming real. Hody's belief of fish-men superiority is so fierce, he fanatically believes that heaven itself has granted him power. Despite Hody seeing Arlong as a role model, there are several factors that greatly distinguish the two, besides the difference in their levels of cruelty. While Arlong was tight with his wallet and could not pay for Hyouzou for his services as well as failing to get Vander Decken IX as his subordinate, Hody managed to make accommodations for these two by being more open with financial compensation and was willing to treat powerful allies as equals instead of being a dominating leader. While Arlong valued and considered his crew as his brothers and was extremely angry when one of his crewmen was used as a shield by Luffy, Hody, on the other hand, does not hold camaraderie in any regard even though he has been close to his officers since they were kids. In fact, Hody had no problem using one of his own subordinates as a shield to protect himself and also taunted Neptune for using himself as a shield to protect his own soldiers from harm, deeming him unworthy to be king because of that. Furthermore, according to Hatchan, while Arlong would not harm his fellow fish-men, Hody will kill any fish-man who has shown sympathy towards humans, even referring to the people who gave their signatures to support the migration as a list of traitors. Also unlike the Arlong Pirates, who demonstrate their pride as Fish-Men by utilizing on their natural strength, Hody and his crew did not care what methods they use to show off their superiority, which was best shown by their heavy abuse of Energy Steroids (as Hody calls Arlong's methods to be barbaric, which the New Fish-Man Pirates believed to a mistake to be learned from). He has gotten so arrogant that he now does not seem to care about anyone but himself and his goal, to the point he is willing to sacrifice 100,000 of his own subordinates without a second thought. Hody is also completely fearless (if not insane and delusional), using Energy Steroids, a potent drug that increases his strength, knowing the effect also shortens his life (though he apparently did not realize it greatly accelerates one's age instead of simply reducing the lifespan). He appears to have developed an addiction to the drug as he continuously ate it throughout the day and even swallowed a giant handful of steroids at once, whether as to gain an upper hand against his enemies or as painkillers. He also threatened his crewmates for preventing him from overdosing, and his violent nature may have been intensified from the side-effects of the Energy Steroids. This arrogant stubbornness led him to overdose heavily and, in turn, destroyed his body, which even then, did not deter him from hating humanity irrationally. His arrogance also made him extremely shortsighted, as he did not even consider the consequences of allowing the Candy Factory to be destroyed, thereby angering Big Mom, whose own power and crew vastly outmatched anything Hody or his crew were capable of combating. Hody considers King Neptune to be a coward and shows a desire of taking Fish-Man Island from him. He will do whatever is needed to achieve his goals as he joined Neptune's army solely for sheer military knowledge and experience and has no qualms about betraying his former comrades. Hody's cruelty, recklessness, hatred, superiority complex and biased goals led Neptune to refer him as quite selfish. He claims that he is fully willing to give his own life to destroy humanity. Hody has shown a great deal of cunning as he deceived the citizens of Fish-Man Island into believing a human murdered Queen Otohime, stole the Energy Steroids from the royal palace without Neptune suspecting him, and later allied with Vander Decken IX (even though Hody does not really see him as an equal) so as to carry out his plan on infiltrating the near impenetrable Ryugu Palace and in an effort to kill Shirahoshi. Hody is also extremely arrogant and boastful (to the point of being insane), showing that he not only thinks himself above all humans, but also above all his fellow fish-men, and went as far as to call the Straw Hat Pirates and a former Warlord of the Sea weak, despite their fearsome reputations and high bounties. Like many other characters, he has a distinctive laugh: \"Jahahahaha!\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Hody had complete authority over the crew. However, he was stripped of this power when he and his crew were arrested by the Neptune Army. Usopp noted that Arlong was nothing compared to Hody. Camie mentioned to Nami that Hody's mind is more dangerous than his strength, with his deep hatred being his drive beyond his physical limits. However, he was shown to be vastly inferior to several of the Straw Hat Pirates, being severely injured by Zoro even while underwater and easily overpowered by Luffy; to compensate, he was forced to gorge on the Energy Steroids to become a match for Luffy. In this overdosed state, Luffy believed Hody's sheer toughness would be enough to earn him a bounty of at least 100,000,000, and he critically injured Luffy (piercing through his Busoshoku Haki) by biting his shoulder. He also has a strong will, as he was largely unaffected by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki, although his hand trembled slightly. Prior to his body becoming old and frail, as a fish-man, he was ten times stronger than the average human, and twice that in water. As a shark fish-man, his strength was monstrous even by fish-man standards: he was able to completely destroy a massive wall of stone by simply gripping it. After overdosing on Energy Steroids (and before they made him weak), Hody Jones' physical appearance drastically changed, resulting in a more muscular body and bleached-white hair. Also, Hody's strength had increased tremendously. However, after his body became weak and old due to his overdosing, he lost both the boost he got and his natural strength to the point where he needed a stick just to walk, and when he tried to pull apart iron bars, his wrists broke. Like Arlong, Hody is also able to grow his teeth back immediately after they are broken. His removed set of teeth are replaced by a new set in mere moments. Also, Hody is capable of entering a kind of berserker mode when he gets angry. His eyes take on an appearance similar to those of Sea Kings. In this state, Hody seems to have gone mad to which Shirahoshi commented that he became far more terrifying than he usually is. During his time in the Neptune Army, he was recognized as a particularly talented soldier. As such, he gained knowledge and experience of combat techniques on the battlefield. Hody was also shown to be an extensive planner and shrewd captain, carefully managing the core group of the New Fish-Man Pirates so that all its members would share his extremist ideals and intense prejudice towards humanity. He shot Queen Otohime of Fish-Man Island and then framed a nearby human smuggler as his scapegoat, to increase support from the wider island community in persecuting humans. He was also more financially supportive of his members, freely willing to spend money to recruit the services of Hyouzou (something which Arlong was unwilling to do), and was also able to recognize the value of an alliance with Vander Decken IX as an equal partner to kill the potential threat of Princess Shirahoshi. During his raid on the Ryugu Palace, Hody was seen holding a long, thin red trident, possibly something he has kept from his old days as a soldier. He managed to defeat Decken with it by stabbing him and then lifting him to block one of Decken's flying axes. In the anime, Hody also threw the trident like a projectile against Zoro. In the manga, Hody was seen holding a different trident after being struck a grievous wound by Zoro and then revitalizing himself with an Energy Steroid. It was a light-colored one with elaborate design underneath the spikes, similar to the one used by Neptune himself, but much smaller. In the anime, he continued using the plain red one. Later in the manga, he returned to using his original trident. The Kirisame is a curved blade that Hody puts on his dorsal fin to cut people while swimming at high speed, being sharp enough to slice through a large oarfish and underwater mountains. This further enhances his shark features. The blade was broken by Luffy during their clash in the ocean. During his assassination of Otohime, he used a rifle to kill her. He showed enough accuracy to shoot her while she was in the middle of a crowd without detection. In the anime, he wielded a long sword in an attempt to execute Neptune. By taking the lifespan-reducing Energy Steroids, which doubled his strength each time he consumed a pill, Hody became far more dangerous than he already was, taking further advantage of his amazing physical strength. The pills were Hody's main source of power for his campaign of terror. Each pill he took doubled his physical strength. During his attack against Crab-Hand Gyro's escaping ship he had taken at least four and while being underwater, granting him strength at least three-hundred-twenty times that of an average human. His jaws were also very powerful as they were all he needed to single-handedly defeat Crab-Hand Gyro, a pirate with a bounty of 73,000,000, and his entire crew. Swimming with blinding speed, he punched holes in their ship and even ripped the mast off using his jaws. He took multiple gunshots to the back and was completely unharmed. These pills also seemed to regenerate the users' wounds to some extent and take strain off them, as seen when a wounded and seemingly unconscious Hody, given one more pill, managed to stand up in mere seconds and to use his strength to its full extent, stopping the gigantic Neptune with just one hand. This led him to abuse the pills as though they were painkillers. After overdosing on the drug to ease the pain of the scar Zoro gave him, Hody underwent a painful transformation into a much more massive form. In this new form, his strength was greater than ever, allowing him to throw a drop of water with extreme force, sending it a great distance across the island, piercing through people, buildings, coral, and rock alike. Thanks to the Energy Steroids, he was also able to withstand a lot of damage from Luffy in Gear 2 and his Busoshoku Haki-enhanced techniques, which destroyed even Pacifistas. Also, Hody was able to swim faster than a mermaid as he managed to catch Shirahoshi while she was fleeing. However, the Energy Steroids came back to do more harm than good as it made his body weak and old after his arrest. When he tried to bust through the prison cell, he screamed in pain as his joints snapped where he tried to draw his strength from. Hody was a practitioner of Fish-Man Karate and he showcased it by his manipulation of water. He could hurl simple droplets of water and turn them into deadly bullets with extreme kinetic force. He could also punch the water to send a shockwave through the water and the victim's body. After overdosing on Energy Steroids, Hody appeared to drip with water even though he was not soaked, suggesting that he had been secreting it. However, despite his enormous strength, and according to both Luffy and Jinbe, Hody's Fish-Man Karate was at an amateur level. This was shown when he fought Luffy, for while Jinbe could do noticeable damage to the rubber man, Hody's attacks were ineffective. After his body became old and frail as a side-effect of the steroids, he likely lost the ability to perform it altogether."},
{"name": "Hogback", "episode": "Episode 446", "chapter": "Chapter 340", "year": 2007, "note": "He was first mentioned by Hildon in Chapter 444.", "appearance": "Despite his round torso, Hogback has very thin arms and legs. His somewhat long nose resembles a beak or knife, and he has notably sharp and long canine teeth and ears. His face has a scar in the shape of a semi-circle that goes above his eyes and connects both corners of his mouth, which is usually grinning widely, and he keeps his black hair slicked back. On the left side of his neck is a black tattoo consisting of two slashes connected to two swirls lying side-by-side on his shoulder. Hogback wears a fishnet vest, purple leather pants, a thick black tie, and a pair of purple gloves, which cover his long, claw-like fingers. He also wears a white surgical mask under his chin, a pair of very small black gold-rimmed sunglasses, a violet feathery cape that is black on the inside, and a pair of purple high-heeled boots. At the time when he first met Victoria Cindry ten years prior to his encounter with the Straw Hat Pirates, Hogback wore a white double-breasted suit over an indigo shirt, gray pants, and a dark blond feathery cape; he also wore his hair with a small swirl sticking out of the front, as well as a golden bangle and pearl bracelet on his right wrist, a silver bangle and ruby-chain bracelet on his left wrist, and rings with large jewels on each index finger and his left thumb, as well as gold rings on his other fingers. When Brook confronted him five years prior to the Straw Hats' arrival on Thriller Bark, Hogback wore his present-day outfit, but had his hair arranged in a chonmage style. As a child, Hogback wore his hair in a bowl cut, with his bangs framing his face. He had round eyes and a small, normally-shaped nose and mouth. Hogback wore a simple white sweater with the word \"genius\" (, tensai?) printed on it as well as black gloves, pants, and shoes.", "personality": "Hogback is immensely arrogant and extremely proud of his reputation as a genius. However, despite saving the lives of numerous people with his medical knowledge and abilities, Hogback considered his patients an annoyance that he had to put up with for the sake of the money they provided, and viewed the doctors who could not help his patients themselves as morons. His views on being a doctor contrast sharply with those of Tony Tony Chopper, who believes that a true doctor must save all patients no matter what, which led to conflict between the two; Hogback even ridiculed Chopper for admiring him and his medical prowess, believing the young doctor was looking up to skills that only brought irritation in the form of an unending lineup of patients. Hogback believes that, with the help of Moria's power to animate corpses with shadows, he has finally managed to overcome death by bringing corpses to life, dismissing the fact that the personality of a zombie is vastly different from the one they held in life and that their wills are bound to Moria. He does not care about the fate of his undead creations and the people whose shadows were stolen to create them. Despite insisting that they are alive, Hogback has no respect for his creations, viciously abusing and humiliating the reanimated Victoria Cindry during his fight with Chopper and Nico Robin just to prove a point. Despite frequently ending up in humorous situations due to the actions of Cindry, Hogback can be serious at times and can plan ahead when necessary, such as when he requested control of two zombies, Jigoro and Inuppe, from Moria to use as his personal bodyguards in case he encountered the Straw Hats; however, though he used them to great effect against both Chopper and Robin, he displayed a degree of gullibility when Robin tricked him into ordering both zombies to jump out of a nearby window. Like many others, he has a unique laugh: \"Fosfosfosfos\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Of the Mysterious Four, Hogback is the only one with no Devil Fruit or notable combat abilities, Hogback is strickly an authoritative figure and thus relies on the zombies he has created to fight for him. However, he does not have absolute command over them; Gecko Moria is their true master, so Hogback only has command over them if Moria permits it. When the Straw Hats began their counterattack on Thriller Bark, Hogback displayed a degree of strategic aptitude by asking Moria for control over Jigoro and Inuppe, using both to briefly overpower Nico Robin and Tony Tony Chopper; however, he was easily tricked by Robin into accidentally commanding the two zombies to jump out of the window. Despite his disregard for human life, Hogback is world renowned as a genius master surgeon who can perform unique operations that are described as miraculous by nature; while working as a doctor, he treated and saved the lives of the countless patients who ever came to him, bringing him incredible fame and fortune, and his skills and disappearance were never forgotten by the medical community. His tremendous surgical skills was sought out by Gecko Moria who tasked him to create the countless zombified creatures on Thriller Bark and even merge some beasts and inanimate objects together to strengthen them. He is also responsible for increasing the physical power of Absalom and Victoria Cindry, as well as modifying Oars's body with a cockpit system in the stomach for Moria to assist Oars in battle from and creating the highly durable webbing of the Spider Mice. His skills allowed him to preserve the hundreds of corpses making up the zombies serving Moria for many years in their pristine state, as Cindry and the many other zombies did not decompose despite working for Moria on Thriller Bark for up to a decade."},

Even when Chopper retaliated with violence, Hiriluk did not back down and ended up taking on a fatherly role to the abandoned reindeer.

While it is unknown where he learned his skills, Hiriluk worked solely on Drum Island, where he was considered a quack doctor by everyone. After his death and despite his lack of knowledge, his beliefs on medicine awoke the Isshi-20's work ethics. Hiriluk's main strength was his scientific experiments and despite being far from medically beneficial, he was able to create several concoctions with varying results. He shared his work with his friends and entrusted it with them after his death. Shortly before his death, he intensified his work, vowing to complete it before that happened. Hiriluk used several firearms during his stay at Drum Island. He used a tranquilizer gun, which he also used to fool people into thinking he has a pistol, and a rifle. He showed some marksmanship skills with his firearms, hitting a moving target with a tranquilizer and intentionally missing Chopper with his rifle. Hiriluk also used bombs to escape his pursuers."},

{"name": "Kaidou", "episode": "Episode 795", "chapter": "Chapter 739", "year": 2015, "note": "He was first mentioned by Gecko Moria in Chapter 456. Part of his face was seen in Chapter 693 color spread.", "appearance": "Kaidou is a middle-aged man who cuts an imposing figure due to his extreme height of 710 cm and the bulk of his muscles, making him dwarf normal humans. Overly top-heavy in build, he has a well-muscled torso with wide-set shoulders, thick arms, and somewhat out-of-proportion legs; far less heavily built than his arms yet about the same length (with his feet much tinier than his hands). Kaidou's head, atop his bulky neck, is disproportionally small as well (smaller than his hands) and has a massive pair of gray-white, sharp-pointed horns coming out of its sides, curving slightly to the front, then upward. During his final fight with Monkey D. Luffy, Kaidou's left horn is broken off. He has a longish face with a heavy, hairless brow ridge topping sharp, often bloodshot eyes (parent to small, yellow irises), plus, a hook nose and a large, full-lipped mouth. Kaidou is near-always seen frowning and is moderately wrinkled: particularly prominent being his crow's feet below his eyes, forehead lines, and laugh lines from always sneering. His black hair consists of an unruly, mostly swept-back mane down to his mid-back, which forms distinctly flat, rectangular locks of which some fall down near the front, over his ears, or jut upward. His facial hair is done in a wavy, waist-length Fu Manchu mustache that pairs with a spiked goatee across his chin. Right of Kaidou's defined abs is his only scar: a massive, recessed X-shape whose upper points reach to his pectoral, given to him by Kozuki Oden. Twenty years later, Roronoa Zoro managed to add another scar to Kaidou's chest that runs from the top left point of the first scar to near his left shoulder. A tattoo of dull-red segments resembling reptilian scales, individually bordered in orange, goes from Kaidou's left pectoral down the front of his left arm, ending in correspondence to the wrist with a white (dark in the manga), traditionally shaped skull on the lower forearm. Clothing-wise, Kaidou dons a blue purple, feathered, sleeveless overcoat draped on his shoulders, and below a lavender, tight-fitting, open shirt with long sleeves. He has a black bracelet with golden (dark in the manga) spikes above each wrist. Upholding said shirt is a thick, off-white belt of laid rope festooned with a pair of white, hanging shide in the front. More outwardly from below the rope hang two additional pieces of fabric: rectangular, hemmed flaps (which may be the bottom of said shirt) that each have, from two hemmed holes at their bottom, a short, thick, golden torus chain attached to themselves. Two yellow straw cords are below the shimenawa, serving as waistbands to secure a short, hanging row of thin, red ribbons. Finally, the rest of his lower wear consists of simple, baggy pants of gray-green color, tucked below the knees into simple, black boots. After his battle against the Big Mom, Kaidou is seen wearing a white version of his usual shirt, which exposed the middle of his body. 20 years before the current storyline, Kaidou's Fu Manchu was only chest-length, he lacked his current beard, had much fewer wrinkles, and until his battle with Oden did not have any visible scars on him. While he was already very large and muscular back then, he was better proportioned compared to his current top-heavy build. When he was facing Gecko Moria, Kaidou wore a green-blue, open vest and black pants with a thick metal belt. During Oden's execution, he wore the pairing of a dark-blue, sleeveless leather jacket and dark-blue, tight leather pants, with a belt featuring his crew's Jolly Roger on its big, round, gold-framed buckle, in red color on a dark background, alongside black shoes. Additionally, he already wore his purple coat and spiked bracelets. At the time he was seen, due to the injury he suffered from fighting Oden, Kaidou's chest and abdomen were heavily bandaged up.", "personality": "Kaidou is a merciless, aggressive, and confident warrior who never misses an opportunity to gain an advantage in war. He suffers from bouts of apathy and boredom, harboring a general sense of unconcern for most things including the very nature of the world and the lives of himself and his subordinates. He keeps a grumpy disposition with little pleasure and excitement in his life and is constantly frowning most of the time. As such, he craves excitement and chaos, wanting to start the largest war in the world because he felt it was too mundane. This was true even during his childhood as a soldier under the service of the Vodka Kingdom, with a young Kaidou barely showing interest in anything outside of constant warfare. Apparently, Kaidou always had issues with the world he lived in, particularly the people governing it, of which authority he did not respect due to his beliefs that the true worth of someone could only be gauged in the battlefield. In the past, Kaidou once believed that only he could change the world, supposedly in an attempt to mimic Joy Boy and his legend; however, Kaidou has admitted that his methods and overall goal ended up being far different. Still, Kaidou remains curious about Joy Boy and whether anyone else is capable of taking up their mantle. He also thinks that Joy Boy could be the one person capable of ever taking him down. Kaidou's recklessness, coupled with his apparent inability to die from any execution method, has caused him to make attempted suicide as his hobby. Kaidou overall has a very positive view on death, thinking that it is the moment a person achieves true glory. As such, he admires those who die fighting until the very end, such as Gol D. Roger, Edward Newgate, and Kozuki Oden and acknowledges the impact they end up causing in those moments. Kaidou becomes excited when battling enemies who can actually stand toe to toe with him in a fight, though he likewise feels immense disappointment when they fail to defeat him. Kaidou is a heavy drunkard who loves to drink sake, which causes his mood to change erratically when he becomes inebriated. For example, he quickly went from being melancholic over his inability to increase the number of his Gifters and fulfill his dream of having a crew consisting of only Devil Fruit users to becoming angry and violent, brutally beating his subordinates and cursing Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar D. Water Law. While drunk, Kaidou may become more destructive by accident since he ends up caring little for his surroundings, to the detriment of his own crew and their operations. In fact, Kaidou is such a habitual drinker that he even dislikes being sober at any given time. His drunken mood swings have been exploited in battle as well through a special fighting style known as Shuron Hakke, which, by Kaidou's own admission, is only used on opponents that give him a challenge. Kaidou is greatly annoyed at the number of people capable of Haoshoku Haki, stating that the world does not need so many people who could use it. Like several other characters, Kaidou has a unique laughing style: \"Worororo\" (, Worororo?). A second one of his has been observed as he was drunk: \"Fuhihihi\" (, Fuhihihi?). As far back as his childhood in Vodka, Kaidou was already very familiar with war and seemingly desired for nothing more than endless combat. This upbringing seemingly influenced his values to revolve around war prowess and, as such, he views the battlefield as a sacred place, and any disturbances to a fight as unjust for taking away a battle's freedom. This is a major factor in his ambition to start a giant war: bringing his form of equality and freedom to the world governed by the World Nobles. Interestingly, despite his declarations opposing the government and its higher ups, Kaidou also provides his supposed enemies with several weapons of his own making (using Kurozumi Orochi and CP0 as intermediaries), further showing that he cares more about the war itself than whoever wins it. With the goal of waging an all-out \"final war\" against the World Government, Kaidou ultimately seeks to form the strongest pirate crew consisting only of Devil Fruit users; so, he actively seeks out formidable manpower in the New World to recruit into his growing army, including Super Rookies from the Worst Generation like Basil Hawkins, Scratchmen Apoo, and X Drake. Rather than kill those who resist him, he attempts to break their spirit through torture and forced labor until they either die or submit to his cause. Kaidou also has an interest in finding the Ancient Weapons and the One Piece for his cause; having taken a Road Poneglyph under his ownership and ruthlessly hunting down Kozuki Momonosuke as well as his three retainers, Kin'emon, Raizo, and Kurozumi Kanjuro, in the chance that Oden may have imparted some knowledge to them. Despite his love for battle, Kaidou is pragmatic enough to avoid conflict that could potentially devastate his forces and territories. When Big Mom attempted to invade Wano Country, Kaidou feared it would become an all-out war and furiously ordered his crew to stop her, especially after being aware that Big Mom's powerful children were accompanying their mother. This was true even in the past, when Oden returned to Wano Country from his journey. Kaidou agreed with Orochi to trick Oden into submission by making a fake deal with him, giving himself time to reinforce his army. Kaidou even admitted to being unsure of fighting Oden during the time of their first meeting, acknowledging the daimyo's infamous bold nature. Akin to the reputation of an oni, Kaidou is savage, brutal and believes that might makes right, using his near unrivaled power to govern others through fear and intimidation while making examples of them should they ever decide to not obey or rebel against his rule. Kaidou, interestingly, does not seem to view himself as a human at all, fiercely thinking that his lineage should not hold a friendly relationship with other humans, but rather distrust and oppose them, under the reasoning that the latter are unable to view the former as anything else than monsters. Kaidou is extremely cruel, even towards children. After murdering Oden, he viciously insulted Oden right in front of his son Momonosuke, adding mockery to Momonosuke's sorrow and hopelessness. Adding to this, he brutally attacked Kurozumi Tama and practically left her for dead. Kaidou also bluntly informed Queen about Komurasaki's \"death\" while casually laughing at Queen's despair over the death of his idol and later found amusement upon seeing Orochi's spiteful execution of Yasuie as well as his ally's cruelty in feeding his own citizens faulty SMILE fruits. As an abusive father, Kaidou has no qualms beating up his son Yamato since childhood, showing that even his own child is not spared from his violence and brutality. Kaidou is known to be hard to reason with and not usually open for negotiations or excuses, making it unwise to provoke or underestimate him; this is enforced dramatically when Donquixote Doflamingo, a former Warlord of the Sea and former World Noble known for his fearless attitude, became disturbed at the prospect of angering Kaidou when he became potentially unable to fulfill his end of their business deal. One of his crewmates later stated that Kaidou would be very angry once he heard the news of the SMILE Factory's destruction, leading to a squad of them attempting to loudly deliver the information from a distance in order to avoid any potential retaliation. Despite this, Kaidou is not completely impossible to reason with, demonstrated by his capacity to form an alliance with another Emperor he had attempted to kill days prior. Kaidou venerates strength and military might above all else, with those ideas being the foundation behind his constant amassing of strong subordinates and numerous weapons. He follows the philosophy of \"survival of the fittest\" and that most problems can be resolved through brute force, agreeing with Kurozumi Higurashi about that being the way human history has always functioned. Those set of beliefs also appear to be the reason that Kaidou despises the World Nobles and their massive power and influence, which are primarily based on birthright alone instead of any actual combat merit. Kaidou is highly confident in his power and considers himself to be far above the likes of Super Rookies from the Worst Generation, to the point of even refusing to take the Straw Hat Pirates and Heart Pirates seriously despite them crippling his SMILE trade; this is reinforced by his belief that defeating a Warlord of the Sea is nothing to be impressed with and subsequent dismissal of Doflamingo as being weak. He was quick to threaten to kill Big Mom when she announced her intention to come to his territory, showing no reservations against someone possessing power equivalent to his own. Kaidou seemingly enjoys taking direct attacks from enemies he perceives as strong in order to test their strength, doing so with much amusement. Despite his immense arrogance, Kaidou does acknowledge other individuals of exceptional strength, such as Ashura Doji and Eustass Kid, wishing to have both become subordinates of his despite their constantly defiant attitude. This extends to Luffy, one of the people responsible for the halting of his SMILE trade that was vital to Kaidou's ultimate goals, yet the Emperor chose to have the Straw Hat captain imprisoned so he could be recruited as a soldier of formidable power instead of killing him. Due to his respect for power, Kaidou is willing to offer strong subordinates a chance to be promoted to an All-Star in his crew as long as they prove it in an authorized challenge against a current one. Since Kaidou sees and acknowledges an enemy's power, he does not blame his subordinates for losing battles against opponents that he deems appropriately powerful. Kaidou forgave Jack for losing to Nekomamushi and Inuarashi in their Sulong forms, because he understands that Jack is not weak, but rather that his enemies were merely too strong to handle. While Kaidou is vicious and ruthless to his enemies, he also showcases a form of strong personal honor and pride to how he fights. When he met Big Mom again for the first time in decades, he told his men to take her Seastone cuffs off before trying to kill her personally in a duel, strictly preferring to fight his enemy fair and square despite having an easier chance to kill his fellow Emperor in a weakened state. Another example of Kaidou's code is that he utterly despises any interference in struggles between himself and an opponent he deems worthy of fighting, and will absolutely not forgive anyone who does so as far killing them as punishment. When a member of the Beasts Pirates seemingly captured Momonosuke (in truth Higurashi in disguise) as a hostage to distract Oden, Kaidou only took the opportunity to strike Oden down because he did not know of the situation until afterwards. Intolerant of foul play in regard to his own battles, Kaidou killed Higurashi for interfering regardless of her being one of Orochi's closest supporters, and upon witnessing the Legendary Hour, Kaidou was solemnly impressed by Oden's strength and willpower. As a last sign of respect for Oden, he informed the daimyo about Higurashi's demise while honestly apologizing to him for her meddling in their battle and opted to kill Oden himself with a gunshot. Twenty years later, when CP0 member Guernica interfered and allowed him to win the fight between him and Luffy, he was horrified by what had happened and furiously smashed the agent despite their ongoing business relationship. When Luffy revealed himself to have survived said interference, Kaidou was thankful for it and even apologized for what had happened previously, something which Luffy accepted. Outside of battle and fighting, however, Kaidou can be rather treacherous and opportunistic. He seemingly believes that betrayal is part of a pirate's nature and admitted that he overlooked the threat of the Nine Red Scabbards because he never expected noble samurai to ally with pirates. Kaidou is not above making false promises, having lied to Oden twice to keep the daimyo and his country in check. The first time, it was to buy time as Oden demoralized himself to Wano's citizens for years, allowing Kaidou to build more strength for his army. The second time was to have Oden and the Scabbards killed so the country would lose their hope of revolution, despite a prior agreement to spare them if they survived a certain punishment. Kaidou also has no qualms killing allies should they outlive their usefulness, having beheaded Orochi once the latter questioned his plot to reform Wano into a pirate paradise despite their alliance of over two decades.", "abilities_and_powers": "As formerly one of the Four Emperors, Kaidou was recognized as one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, famed as the world's \"Strongest Creature\". Notably, he has a bounty of 4,611,100,000, which is the highest known bounty of any pirate currently alive and third highest in history, surpassed only by the bounties of the late Whitebeard and Gol D. Roger. As the Beasts Pirates' Governor-General, Kaidou has authority over a massive, 20,000-strong pirate organization, and due to his alliance with Shogun Kurozumi Orochi, he and his crew enjoy authority over and cooperation with thousands of Wano Country's samurai forces serving Orochi. Even during his time as a kid and during his teenage years as a pirate apprentice with the Rocks Pirates, Kaidou was already formidable and, after his captain's fall and the crew's disintegration, only grew stronger throughout his life. Kaidou attempted to take Whitebeard's life, something very few would dare, and subsequently had an encounter with Shanks, and a clash against Big Mom two years later. Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter stated that Kaidou is one of the few people capable of stopping Blackbeard. His strength was also recognized by his fellow Emperor Big Mom, who could not fathom the idea of Monkey D. Luffy defeating him. According to Trafalgar Law, Kaidou could easily kill Donquixote Doflamingo, a world-famous, extremely powerful pirate in his own right; Doflamingo himself, despite his normally always-retained fearlessness, was visibly distressed at the prospect of angering Kaidou. Additionally, Law speculated that his crew, the Heart Pirates, and the Straw Hat Pirates allied together would only have a roughly 30% chance of bringing down Kaidou, though the statement is questionable seeing as at that time, Law was not serious about fighting him. Kaidou defeated two other members of the Worst Generation, Eustass Kid and Killer, along with the rest of their crew, with seemingly no issue and refused to take Law and Luffy's alliance seriously regardless of their victory over Doflamingo, viewing defeating a Warlord of the Sea as nothing special. Kaidou's confidence was later proven to be warranted when he defeated Luffy with a single blow during their first fight. Before the fight on the rooftop of the Skull Dome even began, Kaidou was convinced that only Gol D. Roger, Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, Shanks, and his late captain were capable of fighting him seriously. Overall, Kaidou has been said to have only lost eight battles in his lifetime and has only been injured twice. As stated during his introduction, people consider it a certainty for Kaidou to win any one-on-one battle he takes part in, and even most groups and armies have little ability to take him down. When the daimyos of Wano Country and the Kozuki loyalists rebelled, Kaidou crushed them, and when hundreds of samurai went to Onigashima to attack Kaidou 10 years ago, they were all killed. He faced the Nine Red Scabbards (except for Kurozumi Kanjuro) and Izou (a former commander of the Whitebeard Pirates) by himself, and although he was having issues dealing with them in his dragon form, he easily overpowered all while in his human form (including Inuarashi and Nekomamushi in Sulong form, whose strength at that time surpassed one of his All-Stars, Jack). Kaidou also took on the Gecko Pirates 23 years ago and slaughtered all of them except for their captain, Gecko Moria. Similar to the other Emperors, Kaidou has many underlings and other pirate crews allied with him and can claim self-governing islands as his territories. With Caesar Clown and Doflamingo as his associates, Kaidou created an army of over 500 Artificial Zoan-type Devil Fruit users, known as the Gifters. Even without his Zoan-type Devil Fruit powers, Kaidou is legendary for his supreme physical power as the strongest creature in the world. With a one-handed swing of his kanabo, he can send normal-sized people flying into the distance with one blow, and he broke past the tremendous defensive power of Luffy's Gear 4 with great ease. He once sunk nine enormous prison ships singlehandedly. Sengoku once said that even as a mere apprentice in the Rocks Pirates, Kaidou was able to earn the respect of his vicious companions through his strength alone. Most remarkably, Kaidou's body is nigh-indestructible far more that his former crewmate and fellow Emperor Big Mom, and even attacks strengthened by ordinary Busoshoku Haki cannot damage his incredibly tough defense. He took multiple powerful hits from Luffy's Gear 3 while in his dragon form and transformed back into his human form after being pummeled into the ground and proceeded to receive a barrage of Gear 4 hits that were even more powerful yet only became sober and felt nothing more than annoyance, received no injuries, and was able to quickly get back up and counterattack without issue. This all changed once Luffy learned how to emit his Busoshoku Haki and attack his enemy's insides during his training while in Udon, making Kaidou bleed with his newest Gear 3 technique, which used advanced-grade Busoshoku Haki, yet the damage inflicted was still \"too shallow\" according to Luffy. While the Red Scabbards were able to accomplish the rare feat of drawing blood from him with their swords and attacks, these wounds were shown to have very little, if any, effect on him. He could withstand having his own immensely destructive Bolo Breath redirected at him by Raizo's Maki Maki no Mi, as well as assaults from Nekomamushi and Inuarashi's Sulong-enhanced attacks, Kawamatsu's Amano-gawa, Izou's Dangirigan, and Kikunojo's Zansetsu-gama, ultimately requiring Kin'emon, Denjiro, Inuarashi, and Ashura Doji to focus and coordinate their Togen Totsuka attacks together at his scar to finally inflict significant damage. However, Kaidou himself stated that the injuries were still shallow in comparison to when Oden inflicted him with a massive scar. This durability has given Kaidou the reputation of being unable to die. He was caught and tortured 18 times, and organizations as powerful as the Marines, and other Emperors have attempted to execute him 40 times, only to fail as Kaidou survived every single attempt because every execution weapon broke when used on him. Most notably, Kaidou jumped 10,000 meters from a Sky Island onto the ground, creating a massive crater and shockwave strong enough to sink a large ship nearby, and emerged with only a small headache; it has even become a hobby for him to attempt suicide, only for it to fail. In fact, it is implied that during his early days, Kaidou allowed himself to be captured the majority of the time, due to being hungry, and used his captivity as a restaurant. Kaidou also clashed with Big Mom continuously for one to three days and emerged without any injuries or signs of fatigue, showing incredible stamina. The first known time he ever suffered a significant injury was in a battle against Kozuki Oden, a legendary samurai who was dual-wielding two of the twenty-one Great Grade Blades, Enma and Ame no Habakiri, gaining a scar on his body. When he was simultaneously attacked by Luffy, Law, Kid, Roronoa Zoro, and Killer, Kaidou also sustained damage. Even in his hybrid form, despite taking more lasting damage from the members of the Worst Generation, Kaidou continued fighting regularly, becoming more irritated than alarmed by their growing ability to damage him, showing that his endurance and pain tolerance are similarly anomalous like his durability. Kaidou was, however, visibly surprised at Law's ability to continually bypass his defenses, as well as Luffy's and Zoro's growing skill with Haoshoku Haki and how both were able to seriously injure him. Despite the young pirate's increased strength and skill with Haoshoku Haki infusion, however, Kaidou was still capable of defeating Luffy singlehandedly, though Kaidou admitted that the fight caused him to get more excited than he had been in a while. Afterwards, Kaidou clashed with his son, Yamato, a powerful warrior in his own right, and consistently overpowered him. Even after enduring countless powerful attacks that were greatly enhanced with advanced applications of Busoshoku and/or Haoshoku Haki, and being weakened in the process, Kaidou was still able to emerge victorious over Luffy in their third fight after landing a lethal blow, though not without unwanted assistance in the form of Guernica. Even the stone-melting flames created by his Kaen Daiko technique seemed to cause no damage or discomfort to his body in the slightest, showing a tremendous near-immunity to fire. Despite his enormous size, Kaidou is extremely fast in combat and can instantly move from one spot to another. He completely blitzed Luffy in an instant while attacking him and appearing behind him afterwards. Another testament to his speed, he was fast enough to nearly once again blitz Luffy despite the latter perceiving the future using Kenbunshoku Haki, only barely avoiding a head-on attack. Kaidou ate the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full serpentine Azure Dragon and a human-dragon hybrid at will. His full Beast Form is massive, roughly half the size of a small town, and is covered with extremely durable, blue scales, dramatically increasing the tremendous natural durability of Kaidou's body. His Human-Beast form grants him a massive increase to his speed, agility, and mobility, while further increasing his vast resilience and physical strength to even greater levels. As a dragon, Kaidou is capable of creating special clouds called \"Flame Clouds\" and using them as footholds, allowing him to move through the air. These clouds can also be used to lift other objects; they are even capable of lifting an entire island out of the sea. He can also release devastating blasts of fire from his mouth, which can instantly deal significant damage to or fully obliterate large structures, such as an entire mountain and the ruined castle that stood upon it. By breathing flames in the shape of a dragon around his body, Kaidou can coat himself in a layer of heat so intense that it can instantly melt substances that come in contact with it, which discourages physical attacks. Aside from his fire breath, Kaidou can also release other elemental attacks from his mouth; he can release bolts of lightning by roaring, or invisible, sharp wind blades by blowing. By twisting his massive body, Kaidou can create tornados which can blow his enemies off the battlefield and into the air. Kaidou has mastered his Devil Fruit powers to the level that he can access some of his draconic abilities without needing to transform, such as generating Flame Clouds to levitate Onigashima. He was even able to do so while battling against five members of the Worst Generation alongside Big Mom. Kaidou is one of the few people in the world capable of using all three forms of Haki, and so far, only him, and Monkey D. Luffy have showcased the advanced application of each one. Law stated that he could not directly move Kaidou around inside his ROOM due to Kaidou's Haki being too strong. Kaidou possesses immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki, as first shown when he clashed against a fellow Emperor and Haoshoku Haki user, Big Mom; producing a lightning effect and burst that shook Onigashima and split the heavens. Additionally, Kaidou can release extremely potent bursts of Haoshoku Haki that can damage the landscape around him and blow away opponents. Most notably, he is among the small \"handful\" of users capable of \"infusing\" Haoshoku Haki into things, particularly, his Hassaikai, signified by the thin streams of black lightning radiating from it. When used in conjunction with his natural strength and Busoshoku Haki, Kaidou can knock out powerful pirates, such as Luffy, Zoro, and Law in one or two strikes. Kaidou is an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, which he is capable of imbuing into his kanabo. During the raid on Onigashima, similarly to Katakuri, his Busoshoku Haki was strong enough to damage Luffy, who hardened both of his arms. He is capable of utilizing the advanced application of this type of Haki, projecting his Busoshoku Haki out from his kanabo, allowing him to strike opponents many meters in front of him with devastating power without the need to make direct contact, and the attack power can be increased further if the kanabo is imbued with Haoshoku Haki. In the anime, when Kaidou uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a purple-colored flowing aura. Kaidou is an extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, as he was able to sense the \"voices\" of the Super Rookies in the wake of his and Big Mom's combined attack, which enabled him to tell they were still alive. He can also use the advanced form that allows him to briefly see into the future, which helps him dodge powerful blows, as shown when he avoided Luffy's Red Hawk and Snakeman attacks. Kaidou wields a large, black, spiked kanabo named Hassaikai as his signature weapon, which he already possessed during his apprentice days in the Rocks Pirates. Thanks to his massive strength and ability to imbue the club with Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki, Kaidou can perform incredibly powerful strikes by swinging it, allowing him to produce large shockwaves, severely injure foes, knock mighty adversaries unconscious with a single hit, and send people flying off into the distance. When Kaidou killed Oden, he used a pistol to shoot Oden in the head. Kaidou borrowed King's sword to behead Kurozumi Orochi. By consuming alcohol, Kaidou can enter a state called Shuron Hakke (, Shuron Hakke?, literally meaning \"Sake Dragon Eight Trigrams\"; VIZ: Drunken Dragon Bagua). In this state, his movements become more unpredictable, he switches rapidly between his Zoan forms, and his Haki becomes stronger."},

Over 41 years ago, during Kurozumi Higurashi's meeting with Orochi, he wore a green kimono with purple diamond patterns. Twenty-five years ago, after Orochi became the shogun of Wano Country, he wore a light colored kimono with a dark dotted pattern, and a dark haori.", "personality": "Semimaru was very calm and did not show much of a reaction in crisis, such as when Oden attacked Orochi, as he simply put up a barrier to protect the latter. When he saw Oden humiliate himself on the street of the Flower Capital, he cackled with his family members, enjoying their successes.", "abilities_and_powers": "Semimaru was a lute priest and was very capable in playing the lute, even when crossing his fingers to use his ability.

His real name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 704. His true identity was revealed by Leo in Chapter 739.", "appearance": "Kyros is a large muscular man with long, flowing hair and a pointy, upwards-facing beard. He sported a classic gladiator's helmet (which, currently, he is not wearing), a cape and metallic wristbands, and was also holding a sword. He also possessed a scar on his forehead from his final fight as a gladiator with King Riku and later sacrificed his left leg to help King Riku before he was turned into a toy. As Thunder Soldier, he is a small toy soldier whose body resembles a dark-colored uniform with four buttons. He has a block-shaped head, square eyes with two blush marks painted underneath, a rectangular nose, a small angular mustache, and a hinged mouth. He also has lanky limbs and a wind-up key on his back. He wears a large round hat with the letters \"SOL\" printed on it. He has a small stub where his left leg used to be, and he wears a roller skate on his right foot, which he has trouble balancing on when standing still. He also carries a small toy rifle.", "personality": "In his younger years, he was shown to be a brutal killer, capable of killing in cold blood and even attacking King Riku. However, he did so in revenge for a dear friend, and keeping himself alive. He actually felt guilty and remorseful about his past as a criminal and felt that he was too unclean and unworthy of many things (such as continuing to interact with Scarlett before their marriage or holding his daughter with his bare hands, the latter making his wife calling him weird), while feeling depressed that the world would remember him as a murderer. During his first appearance, he is very defiant of authority as seen when he was yelling at some police officers. He also appears to be proud to be a toy that brings happiness to people, and gets angry when someone says he is serious, although he knows there are times when he has to be and does so without complaint. Because Sugar failed to make a contract with him, Kyros was the only toy who could rebel against the Donquixote Family. As such, he took his duty as the lone toy who is able to rebel against Doflamingo very seriously, having worked diligently with the Dwarves since his time as a toy in order to save the toys and the Dwarves together. He is kind and helpful towards common people. While he appears to enjoy being a toy, he is saddened by the fact that he cannot shed tears or feel the warmth of a person's touch like people can. When he was raising Rebecca as the Thunder Soldier, he tried his best to make her happy and was not above playing dead, striking strange poses or even singing songs in an attempt to make her happy. In addition, he was shown to be very protective of Rebecca as seen when he protected her from kidnappers and wild dogs. On the other hand, he was potentially overprotective of her given that he often punched anyone who made her cry or tried to give her love letters. In battle, Kyros is a very brutal fighter, as after having returned to his human form, he immediately decapitated Doflamingo's duplicate in an instant and broke Buffalo's neck while mowing down anyone who stood in his way. He is also very determined to save those dear to him, as when Doflamingo prepared to kill King Riku, Kyros immediately freed himself from his Seastone shackles by cutting off his own left leg.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kyros has been an accomplished fighter for much of his life. Even at the young age of 15, he was able to kill two people in a fight. He is the strongest fighter to have ever entered the Colosseum, winning 3000 fights while taking only a single hit from \"Ricky\" though he had let his guard down upon recognizing his opponent. He is an extremely proficient combatant, having defeated many powerful challengers, including a giant and a fish-man, which he fought underwater. He was well known enough for even the Warlord Doflamingo to offer him to join his crew, and when Marine Captain Koby first met Kyros, he could immediately tell with his Kenbunshoku Haki that Kyros was very strong. Another testament of his strength is shown in how he single-handedly sank the ships of a pirate crew that had kidnapped Scarlett, whereas all of her other guards were easily defeated; Kyros defeated the entire pirate crew (leaving their vessel in ruins), without so much as getting a scratch on himself or his ward Scarlett. His abilities are also illustrated from the fact that he managed to train Rebecca in combat to a level where she not only gained a reputation for herself as a fighter, but even managed to become the victor in her block, despite being a toy which would obviously impose restrictions when instructing someone in combat. Even as a teenager, Kyros had tremendous physical strength; he smashed through a thick shield with a blunt sword and beat his cellmates to near-death. Despite having lost one leg, Kyros has shown enormous strength in his remaining leg, able to jump to incredible heights as well as moving at extremely great speed upon returning to human form he was fast enough to take a string clone of Doflamingo by surprise and decapitate the duplicate. He also easily defeated Buffalo with a single move, stopping his high-speed rotation, breaking his neck, and tossing him out of the building. He was even able to maintain his balance and keep moving when Diamante caused the ground to constantly move up and down like a wave, which the elite officer was surprised by. Kyros also has an enormous amount of stamina, having gone six days without food and still been able to fight against several opponents with ease. He cut off his own leg without hesitation in order to attack Doflamingo, although its potential negative impact on him was unknown since he was turned into a toy seconds later. His stamina is matched further by his monstrous durability, as even after being shot in his good leg and being bombarded by steel spiked balls, Diamante noted that Kyros was able to stand and continue fighting even fiercer than ever. Even after being wounded during his fight with Diamante, he was still able to take down a few of the Donquixote Pirates' grunts with no problems. Kyros is also a skilled tactician, having been the one to formulate Operation SOP, a daring plan that exploited both Donquixote regime's tyrannical nature and weak links within their enemies' own ranks, particularly Sugar. Despite numerous setbacks, it would be effective and instrumental in overthrowing Doflamingo by completely breaking the Donquixote Pirates' control over Dressrosa after liberating the countless numbers of victims Sugar had enslaved with her Devil Fruit powers. Being a legendary warrior of the Corrida Coliseum who won 3000 matches, Kyros is an extremely powerful swordsman. His sword skills are of the highest caliber, as he could defeat all of his opponents in the Coliseum matches, including a fish-man underwater and even a giant, using only a blunt sword. He could accurately deflect numerous steel balls that rained down on him by Diamante. Despite having only one leg, which had been shot by Diamante, Kyros was able to match and overwhelm the elite officer's Devil Fruit-enhanced sword skills, and he still managed to defeat the pirate with a single decisive strike. As a toy, he seems to be rather fast and evasive, as he managed to elude the police pursuing him every time, even with one leg. He was able to fight numerous dangers in the past and was a great teacher to Rebecca, as he trained her to be a formidable warrior, fighting without getting hurt or hurting her opponents. However, as his body is a mere toy, it is weak in durability, and as time went by, he continued to break down, with his joints already creaking. His weakened form made him less capable at physically fighting people compared to his human form, however, as he was quickly overwhelmed in hand-to-hand combat by Lao G, and since he was made of inorganic matter, he was susceptible to being ruptured by Gladius' Pamu Pamu no Mi. As Thunder Soldier, Kyros carried a rifle with him at all times, which he used in battle either as a firearm or as a club. At age 15, Kyros wielded a makeshift mace made from a pipe with nails sticking out of it. During his time as a gladiator, he wielded a blunted sword. He later switched to a sharpened bastard sword when he became captain of the guard. While at the Dressrosa Palace as Thunder Soldier, he found a sword he could use after becoming human again and he used it throughout the conflict on Dressrosa."},

He is also insecure about his height, constantly checking for anyone calling him a midget and will violently attack those who do. Kelly is also deceitful and ungrateful by nature, as he lured Law and Luffy into a trap solely to get the bounty that Doflamingo placed on their heads, showing how ungrateful he was of being rescued by Luffy's crew.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kelly is a skilled assassin.

Kelly has his brother Bobby wear him in order to make the most of their respective fighting strengths, combining Kelly's speed, skill, and ferocity with Bobby's strength, resilience, and hulking physique. Kelly used an ordinary pair of boxing gloves during the C Block battle.

Tama has great faith in the Kozuki Family, as she used their name as a threat to those who upset her. However, she can also be careless, as shown when she revealed her allegiance to the Kozuki Family to the Beasts Pirates, drank out of a contaminated river and falling ill in the process, and disregarded her master's warnings not to show her powers in front of others, which caught the attention of Holed'em. Tama speaks with an Edo and a Thoku dialect. She tends to end her sentences in de-yansu (?).

Tama has also been shown to be very shrewd for her age, coming up with the idea of manipulating an amnesic Big Mom into invading Udon to break Luffy free of imprisonment, which later proved crucial in liberating Udon and all of its prisoners to join the Kozuki Revolution. Tama also ingeniously thought of using her Devil Fruit powers to tame all the Gifters of the Beast Pirates to provide support to the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance's final battle against the Beasts Pirates by having Speed, Gazelleman, and Daifugo distribute her dangos to other Gifters to turn them against Kaidou, as well as getting Usopp's and Nami's assistance in her actions. Tama ate the Kibi Kibi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to create \"dango\" from her cheeks. They taste good, but they don't satisfy hunger. Any animal that eats one of these dangos will become utterly tame and subservient to Tama, obeying all of her orders and defending her from harm. The effects wear off after one month, at which point an animal may go back to the way they were before and return to the wild, or choose to remain her companion, whichever they prefer. While the dangos usually do not tame humans, those who have eaten functional SMILEs are susceptible to being tamed due to being part animal. Tama was shown using a club against a member of the Beasts Pirates, and had enough strength to knock him out with it in the manga. In the anime, she used leaves while practicing ninjutsu with Chopper.[citation needed]"},
{"name": "Kuzan", "episode": "Episode 303", "chapter": "Chapter 225", "year": 2003, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 318. Better known by his former epithet Aokiji.", "appearance": "Kuzan is an incredibly tall, slim, yet muscular man. At 298cm tall, he is just slightly shorter than the other two admirals pre-timeskip and he is the shortest of the Blackbeard Titanic Captains. He has black, curly hair cut to chin length that fans out at the tips, tanned skin, and an altogether lean, long build. His standard outfit while in the Marines consists of a white buttoned-up vest with standing collar over a long-sleeved navy-blue shirt, with matching white trousers and black dress shoes. This is all rarely accompanied by a matching white suit jacket. He also wears a yellow tie divided geometrically by black lines and a sleep mask on his forehead. During his preparations for the war against Whitebeard, Kuzan had a white Marine admiral's coat (golden epaulettes and for him being the ice user, blue cuffs) draped over him like a cape, as did the other admirals. He was also seen wearing a green and purple sleep mask at all times two years ago from the present timeline. In contrast to Borsalino and Sakazuki, Kuzan is far younger than his colleagues, being less than fifty years old. His looks, combined with his manner, make him appear even younger than he actually is. As a child, Kuzan had a grimace on his face. He wore a dirty light blue shirt and a purple pair of shorts with white stripes. He carried an umbrella tied on his back, a bottle of alcohol and a backpack. Also, his hair was curlier compared to his current hairstyle. In his youth, Kuzan wore a white Marine cap and a shirt. Twenty-two years ago, during the Ohara Incident, Kuzan wore a dark blue bandanna with a white Marine symbol on it, as well as a pair of black round sunglasses, as well as an indigo coat with the Marine emblem on the left chest and the back. This outfit was also what he wore 27 years ago, during the Battle of Edd War. After the timeskip, his attire bears similarities to what he wore in his 20's. He wears a blue bandana that covers most of his hair, leaving only the tips which fan out. He wears a white V-neck shirt with black trousers, as well as an open dark blue green trench coat that extends past his knees. He also now wears black cowboy boots and travels with a knapsack carrying his belongings, along with his old pair of green round sunglasses. Like his rival Sakazuki, he also has grown facial hair, namely, a thin mustache and a beard. After his duel on Punk Hazard, Kuzan received several burn scars spanning from the right side of his neck down to his entire right shoulder and onto his torso. His right hand is also heavily scarred, and he lost part of his left leg, for which he now wears a prosthesis made of ice formed by his Devil Fruit ability. During the Egghead Arc, Kuzan wears a light-colored frilled dress shirt with a cravat, dark pants, and a dark-colored trench coat with a fur collar which he wears draped on his shoulders.", "personality": "Kuzan is a very laid-back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and \"Lazy Justice\" (, Darakekitta Seigi?) (as he describes his motto himself) often leads others to believe he cannot possibly be a marine of such a high ranking, which causes them to underestimate him, making him all the more dangerous (it is unknown whether this is a facade or if he is genuinely lazy). However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action. During the Whitebeard War at Marineford, Aokiji grudgingly shredded his usual lax and friendly nature, for a more ruthless and aggressive personality, repeatedly targeting Whitebeard himself with his Hie Hie no Mi, managing to severely injure \"Diamond\" Jozu and generally hampering any attempts at rescue or escape for the invading pirate fleets. In accordance with the age difference between him and the other pre-timeskip admirals, Kuzan does not refer to himself with \"Washi\" (?), the \"I\" typical for older men but the \"I\" more frequently used by younger men and teens, the rather rough \"Ore\" (?); altogether, his manner of speaking is far more lax than Borsalino's (who is exceedingly polite), containing a lot of ellipses and contractions, yet lacking the rude connotation of Sakazuki's speech, and being far more calm. He tends to begin addressing people with \"excuse me\"/\"I hate to interrupt, but\" (, chotto gomen na?). Aokiji is a compassionate man, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with his ability and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara by providing a small boat while also a trail of ice for her to leave safely even sabotaging the ships that were about to go after her. Despite being a marine, this compassion can even extend to pirates as long as their actions are mostly benevolent. He chose not to arrest or kill Luffy because the young pirate had defeated Crocodile beforehand, thus saving Arabasta from the latter's malevolence. In contrast to his former colleague, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan sometimes tolerates compromises with pirates. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he follows Lazy Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in and does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, even if reluctantly. He froze his former friend Jaguar D. Saul during the Ohara Incident following this reasoning. As a marine, Kuzan was a faithful follower of the World Government. His motto used to be \"Burning/Fired Up Justice\" (, Moeagaru Seigi?) before switching to Lazy Justice. He always tried to follow orders, but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to them. Even as Kuzan followed his orders, he would occasionally exhibit a sense of mercy and honor other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Kuzan has come to realize the depths to which the World Government will sink to accomplish their goals. His relaxed demeanor while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of fleet admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position due to the latter's immense ruthlessness and dueled his fellow admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Sakazuki's command. Having left the Marines and realizing just how truly corrupt the World Government had become after the timeskip, Kuzan became a wanderer. He still cares for his friends, rescuing Smoker from Donquixote Doflamingo's fury during a visit to Punk Hazard. However, Kuzan appears to be now involved in shady dealings with pirates, having joined forces with the Blackbeard Pirates for unknown reasons. Doflamingo was convinced that Kuzan had something planned while Smoker thought the same, as he was aware of Kuzan's involvement in the Underworld. Kuzan reassured Smoker that he had not changed at all, cryptically stating that he could still accomplish things as an independent observer. After joining the Blackbeard Pirates, Kuzan openly expressed he did so because he wishes to begin living for himself instead of for others, perhaps showing some resentment for his time as an enlisted officer and the things he was made to do or prevented from doing. He wanted to take back his personal freedom and live life on his own terms, something Teach sympathized with, and was seen being quite jolly with a somewhat dry sense of humor as they drank together. He has a recurring phrase, \"Arara\", meaning \"Oh, my\", which is frequently used when something surprises him.", "abilities_and_powers": "While an admiral, Kuzan held power over the thousands of lower-ranked Marine personnel, his status being just below Fleet Admiral Sengoku's. He could command fleets, have a say on the overall strategy of the organization, and issue special orders, like the enactment of a Buster Call on any island he deemed a threat or delegate to lower-status government agents the same privilege. With his resignation, of course, came the forfeiture of any such powers. Nonetheless, despite the outward indolence that Kuzan showed in casual situations, holding such a high military office bore out his leadership prowess. Further attesting to these skills as a leader, plus his charisma, is the support Kuzan enjoyed from among subordinate ranks to become fleet admiral following the Summit War, as well as having Sengoku himself personally select him as his successor (as opposed to Akainu's backing coming mainly from governmental dignitaries). As a combatant, Kuzan with his fellow admirals was held as the \"Greatest Military Power\" that the World Government and Marine Headquarters could bring to bear, making him one of the world's strongest people. Being one of the Marines' chiefest assets, his departure had a notably detrimental impact on their force, with one of the Five Elders referencing his \"enormous power\" in his dismay over Kuzan's affiliation with the Blackbeard Pirates. According to Brannew, Kuzan's strength as a Marine \"hero\" was not gifted at birth but rather built up by training, as was the case with Monkey D. Garp. Still, since his early days in the Marines, Kuzan seemed quick to learn everything that instructors would teach him, leading him to start training under Garp as he subsequently rose through the ranks. During Kuzan's time as a vice admiral over two decades ago, his strength was already considered abnormal for someone of his rank, as illustrated by Jaguar D. Saul, an extremely powerful giant who used to be a vice admiral himself, being taken down by Kuzan easily with a mere two attacks, after having fled at Kuzan's mere sight. The first hint given to Kuzan's reputation involved Nico Robin; though arguably the most well-composed of the Straw Hats, she completely panicked and lost her grip in the admiral's presence, this relating to her childhood trauma (despite Kuzan having spared her as a child). During his first encounter with the Straw Hats on Long Ring Long Land, Kuzan effortlessly overwhelmed their top three fighters in a single moment, followed by him incapacitating Robin without her able to retaliate in any measure, and subsequently dealt a swift but crushing defeat to Monkey D. Luffy in a duel that saw the rookie pirate completely at the admiral's mercy, unable to lay so much as a scratch on him (though largely due to having no means to hurt the admiral's Logia form). During the Summit War, Kuzan's power was well-exemplified against the Whitebeard Pirates, with him engaging Whitebeard, the world's strongest pirate, head-to-head and holding his own, albeit briefly until Jozu's interference. He would go on to battle Jozu, one of Whitebeard's most formidable men, and defeat him with relative ease upon exploiting an instant's distraction of his foe, robbing him of an arm and incapacitating him for the total rest of the war. Ultimately, Kuzan himself emerged from the war almost entirely unscathed, with nothing but a small bruise to show for it. Against Akainu, Kuzan would prove his then-fellow admiral's equal in strength. A one-on-one duel between the two saw them meeting one another blow for blow throughout most of the fight, such that it took ten entire days to settle; though Akainu was the one to emerge victorious, both men sustained grievous injuries. Upon encountering the Blackbeard Pirates a year after his fight against Akainu, Kuzan was able to swiftly defeat several of Blackbeard's officers, including the enormous Sanjuan Wolf and other ex-prisoners from Impel Down's Level 6, by freezing them up in a matter of seconds. In the year since joining hands with Blackbeard, Kuzan has become a powerful asset of the Emperor's crew, and with his position of Titanic Captain comes the authority over the Blackbeard Pirates' Tenth Ship. In particular, Kuzan's knowledge of the Marines' inner workings, including the most secretive organization SWORD, provides valuable intel for the crew. In Totto Land, Kuzan managed to ice up and thus defeat Charlotte Cracker, one of Big Mom's strongest commanders with an 860,000,0000 bounty, without coming to harm himself. When he approached Garp face-to-face on Hachinosu, Kuzan began fighting on nearly even grounds against his former mentor who, despite bemoaning his decline in strength, still demonstrated monstrous fighting ability against the many Blackbeard Pirates present on the island, with Garp initially holding the upper hand against the ex-admiral. Ultimately though, with the aid of his fellow Titanic Captains, Kuzan managed to subdue Garp and left him on the ground impaled with a massive icicle, slowly freezing up, even though Garp had been more preoccupied with letting his students escape the island than with defeating the enemy. Aside from combat, Kuzan is shown to have enough navigation skill to be able to traverse the Grand Line seas using a simple bicycle (assisted by his ice powers to create a track by which to cycle on the water). Kuzan's physical prowess is immense, befitting his former admiral position. His strength is particularly notable, having developed massive punching power from years of training under Garp since his early marine days. Like his mentor, Kuzan would use retired battleships like sandbags (\"battleship bags\") to train up the force of his punches, while not permitting himself to use his Devil Fruit or Haki; ultimately, Kuzan reached a point where, like Garp himself, he could cave in the armored hulls of ships with the sheer force of his blows. Two years ago, against the much weaker Straw Hats, Kuzan proved his strength by casually stopping Sanji and Zoro in their tracks using a single hand to grab hold of each, simultaneously taking a punch to the gut from Luffy without seemingly turning to ice, yet not so much as reacting or losing his grip on the former two. Post-timeskip on Hachinosu, Kuzan showcased power roughly on par with Garp's, at least enough to have an even exchange of blows with the elder marine that sent both of them flying (though Garp noted that his strength was nowhere near what it used to be). Attesting to his tremendous endurance and strength of will, Kuzan managed to fight his equal Akainu for a total of ten days before being defeated, and despite suffering grievous injuries (including the loss of a leg) he recovered. Kuzan's durability, likewise, is impressive. At Marineford, he remained unfazed by a Haki-imbued kick from Marco that sent him flying with great force and later a violent, Haki-enforced tackle from the diamond-bodied Jozu, the latter of which (coming as a sneak attack) left him only slightly bleeding from the mouth. When fighting Garp on Hachinosu, Kuzan was able to swiftly recover from being subjected to the latter's powerful, Haki-infused Blue Hole attack that slammed him into the ground headfirst, hard enough to make a deep crater, Kuzan reemerging with only some minor bruises. When both Kuzan and Garp subsequently exchanged Haki punches to the face that caused a massive explosion and sent both hurtling back, Kuzan rose up moments later with, still, only superficial wounds on him. The ex-admiral is also extremely fast and agile, able to close large distances and jump to extreme heights within seconds (often implicitly aided by his powers, traces of ice being visible on spots he leaps from). His attack speed is notable as well, with him managing to intercept Whitebeard's quake-powered naginata mid-swing by fully encapsulating its wielder in ice and subsequently avoid a quick, Haki-infused surprise thrust of Whitebeard using the same weapon, by seamlessly opening up a hole in his icy self just large enough to avoid contact with the blade. Against Doflamingo (a Kenbunshoku Haki user), Kuzan proved fast and stealthy enough to sneak up on him, taking his back without the Warlord noticing until Kuzan spoke, and thereupon prevent Doflamingo from dealing a killing blow to Smoker by icing him up faster, with precision, than he could move his hand, while leaving Smoker untouched. Otherwise, the admiral has shown rather acute hearing, able to notice underwater activity from hundreds of meters away and overhearing Laffitte's whispers to Blackbeard amidst loud partying in a bar. Kuzan ate the Hie Hie no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into ice. Compared to most Logia users who, when transformed, can let physical attacks pass through their \"fluid\" bodies, Kuzan is more easily hit since ice is a solid element. However, he still goes unharmed by enemy attacks that are not infused with Haki; instead of dissipating out of harm's way, his body shatters apart when struck, only to reform as effortlessly as any Logia user thereafter. Kuzan is able to form constructs out of ice. In combat, Kuzan can create weapons, primarily forming swords and spears, but can also make more elaborate constructs, like a giant pheasant to send flying at enemies. By imbuing his icy fist with Haki, he can also greatly empower his punches. On a smaller scale, Kuzan can quickly incapacitate enemies by freezing them solid on contact or from a distance by launching waves of ice, and may even encase opponents in large spheres of ice to make escape even more difficult. Aside from potentially suffering dangerous degrees of frostbite and hypothermia, those frozen by Kuzan are left in a very fragile state, as they body could be shattered by any kind of impact; however, a person can be freed from the ice if they are thawed out properly and carefully. On a larger scale, Kuzan can spread his freeze outward over tremendous distances, casually icing over several square kilometers of ocean within seconds of dipping his hand in the water, or turning a pair of mountainous tsunamis into icebergs just as swiftly, using icy beams shot from his hands. Despite the speed at which Kuzan can flash-freeze massive amounts of water, the ice he thereby forms tends to be extremely thick and able to persist for long periodsseveral days even. Kuzan can also bypass his weakness to water and falling therein by freezing it before he can sink below the surface. Not only does this keep him from drowning, it lets him prevent enemies from escaping by sea, by freezing their ships in place, or render the sea a solid battleground for entire armies to fight on. Even by Logia standards, this ability has impressive potentialwhen used excessively for ten days straight, it was able to permanently alter the very climate of half an island, rendering it a frozen, uninhabitable wasteland with constantly raging blizzards. As a former marine admiral, Kuzan is a highly skilled Haki user. During the Summit War, Kuzan was seen using advanced-grade Busoshoku Haki to negate an extremely powerful quake shockwave sent out by Whitebeard, by generating, with his fellow admirals, an emitted shield combination of their three Haki to disperse said shockwave. On its own, Kuzan's Haki is shown to be enough to allow the ex-admiral to have an even exchange of blows with Garp, a wielder of both Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki, causing a massive explosion when they struck one another with their Haki-imbued fists. Kuzan possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Kuzan has been shown to be adept at using weaponry formed from ice, like a hand-wielded sword to clash with another swordsman."},

His name was revealed by Kin'emon in Chapter 909.", "appearance": "Orochi was a rather large man with a big head and stocky build. He appeared to be balding, with his dark purple hair being mostly seen on the sides and back of his head, and he had a long topknot in the back, as well as a thin mustache that sticked upward. His two upper canine teeth were longer than his other teeth and were blunt, remaining so in his Zoan hybrid form. He wore a gold kimono with a fan-shaped pattern on it, a blue robe with flowers on it, and a crown on his head. In his transformed state, the main head was a darker olive green with red scales while the other heads were a lighter shade with yellow scales. Every head had black horns, orange eyebrows, and light purple scales. Each head also had red eyes with blue irises and purple tongues.", "personality": "As one of the last members of the Kurozumi Family, who were disgraced and stripped of their power and authority, Orochi developed an immense greed and thirst for power from an early age due to being forced to live in poverty since birth. When he worked as a servant for Yasuie, Orochi outwardly exhibited a timid and servile attitude, but this was all an act to steal money by preying on the sympathies of others. Orochi was in truth extremely deceptive and dishonorable, bending laws and rules to suit his own needs and never acknowledging promises or deals to those that he viewed as a threat. Having been twisted by the Kurozumi Family's unfair persecution since his childhood, Orochi was an extremely cruel and oppressive tyrant who took joy in making his subjects suffer as revenge for his family's persecution. Under his rule, the people of Wano suffered great famines. The officials under him also harshly enforced his regime, and he collaborated with Kaidou to not only kill Kozuki Oden, but also allowed the Beasts Pirates to turn Wano into a nearly complete wasteland in exchange for borrowing Kaidou's power and protection, disregarding his country and people in favor of his own self-interest. Due to his power and connections, he was completely fearless and arrogant, proclaiming that he did not fear the Celestial Dragons nor the Marines. He even shot a CP0 agent, confident that they could do nothing against him. This arrogance blinded him to the fact that he was in truth just a pawn for Kaidou and that Kaidou only protected him as long as it suited his own interests. Even as Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates turned Wano into a wasteland, Orochi expected that the Flower Capital would remain prosperous and was shocked when Kaidou revealed his intentions of using it to make more factories. He defiantly opposed Kaidou's New Onigashima Project by reprimanding him for his ingratitude, all while clearly forgetting the fact that he had completely relied on Kaidou's power for protection. Although he hated his country, Orochi desired to create an image of him being a heroic and strong ruler with a happy populace. During his reign, he had schools teach propaganda about him being the one to defeat Oden and maintain the country's isolation when, in reality, Kaidou was the one who did those things. When meeting with CP0, he claimed that the citizens around them were happy, although this reality only existed in the wealthy Flower Capital. To give the impoverished citizens the facade of happiness, Orochi put defective SMILE fruits in their food supply to render them unable to express negative emotions. Orochi was an extremely domineering and unreasonable man with absolutely no tolerance to anyone who defied or spoke ill of him, even if it was out of his earshot and in casual discussion. He made those actions a capital crime, which the Gifters enforced. Orochi was petty enough to kill any man, woman or child who offended him, going to any lengths to see them dead (only showing temporary hesitation towards a woman he held feelings for) and refused to take responsibility for the consequences of his own actions, preferring to blame others instead by branding them as criminals. Orochi had an extremely murderous mindset, becoming angry if a target escaped from his wrath and would send countless subordinates or even assassins to deal with individuals he wanted gone, no matter how threatening they may be, as well as those that protect or assist said individuals. The subordinates that fail to uphold his rule are callously discarded from his ranks and then punished accordingly. Orochi was also immensely extravagant and hedonistic, as he loved to hold banquets with luxurious food and drinks accompanied by refined music and dancing. He was picky with his choice of food and extremely wasteful. Moreover, he employed only the finest geisha of Wano, such as Komurasaki, to perform at his banquets. Komurasaki in particular was the main target of Orochi's affections, with the latter wishing to make the former his bride. Orochi's feelings for Komurasaki, however, were very shallow since he only loved her due to beauty. He thought of himself as the only one with the right to have her as a result of his pride and possessiveness. Though arrogant, Orochi avoided being totally overconfident out of fear, as he was a coward by nature. As a highly cautious and attentive man, he took any and all threats to his rule seriously. To this extent, he prohibited the use of weapons and banned all martial arts dojos to deprive any dissidents of the means to incite a rebellion. Orochi also acknowledged the fact that the Nine Red Scabbards and Momonosuke survived, believing his information sources and the fact that their bodies were never found. His warnings about the return of the Kozuki retainers caused many of his complacent servants to view him as a coward, merely overreacting out of fear for Toki's prophecy. Though his servants were often afraid to voice this skepticism out loud, Orochi was aware of the fact that he was thought of as paranoid, but overlooked this due to having the authority to have his commands carried out regardless. Orochi remained resolute in his refusal to release the prisoners in Rasetsu Town despite Yasuie convincing people that everything was a result of Orochi's mistake, going as far as imprisoning their families alongside them if they attempted to protest. Ironically, while he was careful with the Kozuki Family and the rebels, Orochi could be too trustful as he never suspected his subordinate Kyoshiro of being affiliated with either the Kozuki Family or the rebels and never expected Kaidou's betrayal. Despite his usual cautious attitude, Orochi could make rash decisions in the heat of the moment as he was willing to execute Yasuie in a public demonstration, without taking into account the latter's popularity with his citizens and the potential to arouse their dissatisfaction by killing him. According to Hyogoro, despite all the precautions Orochi took to minimize the chances of his own downfall, he had failed to notice the great flaw in his policy of condemning all his dissidents to life imprisonment in Udon, which allowed hatred to breed among tens of thousands of people for over two decades. Having lived in safety and protection for twenty years with the help of the Beast Pirates and his countless subordinates such as the Kyoshiro Family, Mimawarigumi, and the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Orochi sometimes lost all sense of danger. When Zoro attacked him, Orochi was deeply shocked that someone had actually tried to kill him despite his authority and power as the shogun. Orochi's unexpected complacency also led him to miscalculate the distances of the regions of Wano due to having spent all his time in the Flower Capital as he acted too late in stopping the rebels from gathering. After being betrayed by Kaidou and having his delusional pride and glory as the shogun completely insulted and humiliated by the latter taking all of his forces through an ultimatum, with the Mimawarigumi and Orochi Oniwabanshu (with the exception of Fukurokuju) pledging loyalty towards Kaidou instead of punishing the latter for decapitating him, Orochi went insane due to his excessive arrogance and anger, hell bent on taking revenge on his former benefactor for his treachery. He still retained enough reason to know that it was impossible to attack Kaidou himself due to the latter's power thus he resorted to arson, setting fire to Onigashima's residence knowing that it would be impossible for the Beast Pirates to escape due to Kaidou levitating the island, though he seemed to forget the fact he was also trapped on the floating island himself. While he believed he could have safely fled the flying island with Fukurokuju's help, he recklessly started his plan to destroy Onigashima and everyone on before getting off himself. He had a habit of using the phrase \"Don't be reserved!\" (, Kurushnai?), an expression used in historical context by people of high social status in response to their servants. Like other characters, Orochi possessed a unique laugh: \"Gufufufufu\". He also used the variations \"Gufuhahaha\" (?) and \"Guhoho\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As shogun, Orochi had full control over Wano Country and its inhabitants. He had government officials working under him who enforced his rule, and had a group of elite ninja known as the Orochi Oniwabanshu, as well as a squad of samurai known as the Mimawarigumi who served and protected him without question. He also had the backing of Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors, so if he and his subordinates were threatened, Kaidou would hear about it and deal with the threat, which was proven in the past when Kaidou brutally ended a massive rebellion staged by countless samurai led by the daimyos serving the Kozuki Family against Orochi's new rule. He believed that with Kaidou's support, not even the Marines and Celestial Dragons could overthrow him or topple Wano. However, with Kaidou having betrayed and attempted to kill him, Orochi lost much of the power that came from their alliance as well as many of his subordinates. In terms of personal combat, Orochi had very little skills to speak of, having always relied on others to protect him and fight his battles. Orochi had an extremely sharp intuition and a strategic cunning, as he orchestrated Kanjuro to infiltrate the Nine Red Scabbards as a mole. Unlike most of his complacent subordinates, Orochi took Toki's prophecy seriously, which allowed him to correctly deduce that Oden's son and retainers were still alive and that certain incidents around Wano Country were connected to Kin'emon. He wholeheartedly believed that they were planning to overthrow him and his ally Kaidou, even though there was no concrete evidence to support his suspicions. Through his spy, Orochi received information regarding Kozuki Hiyori, the time travel of the Nine Red Scabbards, and the assembly location and numbers of the enemy alliance. This allowed him to correctly figure out their plans and take effective actions to prevent them from mobilizing, by destroying the cave containing the Thousand Sunny and blowing up all the bridges connecting the country's regions ahead of time. However, Orochi's efforts failed due to Kin'emon misreading Yasuie's message as well as Orochi miscalculating the distances of the regions, acting too late in stopping them. In the Flower Capital school, Orochi was lauded as being a powerful swordsman said to utilize a sword-style known as Orochi Two Sword Style (, Orochi Nitry?, literally meaning \"Orochi Two Sword/Blade Style\"), and according to propaganda, he used this style to defeat Kozuki Oden and his retainers. However, this is all false information to paint him as being a powerful shogun, as it was Kaidou who defeated Oden, with Orochi not even being present during the battle. After hearing Toko laughing after his raving about the Kozuki Family, he used a katana to slice wildly through a thin wall while completely missing Toko, displaying little to no skill in swordsmanship. Orochi had great marksmanship skills, having been seen wielding a flintlock pistol and rifle. He was able to quickly draw his pistol and shoot a CP0 agent in the head with it, although the agent was unharmed by the bullet. With his rifle, he was able to shoot Shimotsuki Yasuie to death from a great distance away, and was shown aiming directly at Toko's head when trying to shoot her. Orochi ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to transform into a full eight-headed snake and a human-eight-headed snake hybrid at will. He primarily used this power to intimidate people. As a Zoan user, Orochi received a boost to his physical abilities, though he was never seen using his enhanced physical capabilities in battle. In his eight-headed snake form, he was able to deal considerable damage to the room he was in and attack the people who were there with him, though it is unknown exactly how much damage the people took. He was also strong enough to easily lift up a person with just his mouth. With his multiple heads with long necks, he had the ability to attack in multiple directions at once and reach targets that are farther away than he can normally reach. Furthermore, he was able to attack and trap his targets with his considerably strong jaws. Perhaps the greatest benefit of this power is that it allowed Orochi to survive beheading, even in his human form, although he had one fewer head than before. Since his Devil Fruit gave him eight heads, decapitating Orochi did not kill him until he was subjected to it eight times."},

On his back, Kanjuro carried a large brush which he kept in readiness for use with his powers. As a retainer of the Kozuki Family, he bore the crest somewhere on his body.", "personality": "According to Orochi, due to Kanjuro being raised in the theatre, his main purpose in life was to act as someone else. Due to his parents dying during the persecution of his family, Kanjuro wished to avenge them and then die. Kanjuro played the role of a loyal retainer to the Kozuki Family so that he would eventually be killed with them. In his role as a Kozuki retainer, Kanjuro acted quite selflessly, since he encouraged Kin'emon to leave him behind and pursue Momonosuke. Kanjuro was also very calm and level headed, as he reprimanded Shinobu for being too rash in resolving unexpected setbacks. However, there are times where he can act absent-minded, such as when he created a net for the citizens of Dressrosa to climb up the old King's Plateau, not knowing they were aiming to capture Usopp and King Riku. He also fooled around during the escalade of Zunesha's leg and failed to realize that Bariete was falling towards him, hitting Kin'emon and him and making them fall off the elephant. He also acted overzealous at times. For instance, when he realized he put Usopp in danger, he stated he would cut open his own stomach as compensation. However, he quickly decided against such actions when Kin'emon told him not to. However, due to his complete loyalty to the Kurozumi Family, he did not develop any genuine attachment to the Kozuki Family despite all the moments they shared together. Once Orochi ordered him to drop the charade and bring Momonosuke to Onigashima, Kanjuro did so without hesitation, revealing his true identity to those who thought of him as a comrade. He did not show remorse for his actions, even though they caused turmoil to their alliance and emotional pain to the other Nine Red Scabbards, particularly Kin'emon, for betraying their trust and friendship. Upon revealing his true nature, Kanjuro showed to be merciless and sadistic. Before departing for Onigashima, he abducted Momonosuke and attacked the Kozuki samurai. He also taunted his former friend Kawamatsu by threatening to kill Hiyori, and mocked his former allies' attempted revolution. When Momonosuke tried to escape, Kanjuro brutally beat him to the point of unconsciousness and casually handed him over to Orochi and Kaidou justifying himself because the boy had cut his hand, even referring to him as a little brat, thereby ungratefully disregarding the kindness and care Oden and the child had showed him. Even worse, while the Red Scabbards held back on him due to their lingering camaraderie, he showed neither reciprocation nor gratitude as he sadistically created a painted clone of Oden to launch a brutal psychological attack against them, while taunting them of killing Momonosuke despite his own wounds. As a Kozuki retainer, Kanjuro referred to himself with soregashi (?), an archaic personal pronoun used by samurai. After revealing his true loyalties, he switches to ore (?), an informal personal pronoun commonly used by men. Like most other characters in the series, he has a unique Laughter Style: \"Ka, ka, ka\"", "abilities_and_powers": "Kanjuro had immense strength, able to easily carry around and use his giant ink brush without tiring, and could equally clash with Kawamatsu, a fish-man with ten times the physical strength of an average human. By imbuing his brush with Busoshoku Haki, Kanjuro was able to help push back and significantly slow down the contraction speed of Doflamingo's Torikago, along with many other powerful combatants. During his journey through Onigashima, he took down several members of the Beasts Pirates with no effort. Even after being cut down twice with fatal injuries, Kanjuro was still able to continue attacking and drawing, although he would eventually succumb to his wounds. Kanjuro had some skills in brush making, as he used the hair of people and corpses to make brushes for a living. When operating with the Kozuki Family, Kanjuro pretended that he was very bad at drawing, producing only poorly-drawn, barely functional constructs by using his left hand. However, he was actually an extremely skilled artist, able to draw life-like creatures, including human beings. Despite having spent years acting like a mediocre artist, his true skills did not deteriorate, as he was able to produce perfect drawings once he ceased his act. The speed and precision of Kanjuro's artistry were also impressive, as he was able to draw a large crane in an instant. Due to being raised in a theater troupe, Kanjuro was a consummate actor - a talent further improved by his lack of individuality as stated by Orochi. He was able to perfectly pose as a loyal retainer of the Kozuki Family for 21 years, fully adapting to his new identity and even faked genuine emotions such as sorrow at the death of Oden and later Yasuie despite not having any attachments to them in the first place. He also hid his true skills from them, giving them the facade of an amateur artist who could not make full use of his Devil Fruit's potential, in order to give himself a strategic advantage despite the risk he put them (himself included) through when his purposely poor drawings caused them to nearly fall off Zunesha. Although some events raised suspicions of a traitor in the family's midst, no family member or retainer ever suspected that Kanjuro was the spy until he told them. Kanjuro ate the Fude Fude no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to generate ink that he can use to draw pictures and manifest and control anything he drew. His three-dimensional drawings had the same abilities as the things they are depicting; a drawing of a bird is able to fly, and a drawing of food is edible (although, according to Kin'emon, it hurts his stomach). He could create ink from his long hair and draw with it, or channel his power through his giant ink brush. Kanjuro could use this power to create a variety of useful constructs; such as creating ladders to climb out of a deep pit, or by creating animals who abilities would prove helpful. His created animals were as capable as real ones, if not more, such as snakes with powerful constricting strength, or elegant flying cranes. Furthermore, Kanjuro hid his powers' more potent usages from the Kozuki Family, such as generating ink from his hair to create a rain of hardened ink droplets. Provided he knows the person whose effigy he is drawing, Kanjuro could make the drawing's voice identical to that of the person, which allowed him to create a perfect replica of Kozuki Oden that actually managed to fool most of the other Scabbards. When the Nine Red Scabbards sailed out to Onigashima to confront Kaidou, Kanjuro sent a perfectly drawn clone of himself with them, with none of them noticing until Kin'emon decapitated the drawing. Kanjuro could also combine his acting skills with his paintings to create psychological attacks, as he did so by animating a painting of Kozuki Oden and using his knowledge of the daimyo's personality to create a persuasive illusion of him. This deception managed to catch the Nine Red Scabbards off guard, and when the truth was discovered, they were psychologically wounded. The clone was also strapped with dynamite, creating a walking bomb that was strong enough to kill Ashura Doji. Kanjuro could apply a layer of ink over himself to create a full-body disguise similar to the drawn effigy. Kanjuro's power could also affect his own body, as he hid inside a wall as a drawing to avoid detection. To increase the versatility of his Devil Fruit powers, Kanjuro kept a giant ink brush named Tuji Shibai with him. It had a katana hilt and guard, with a tassel tied to the pommel. He wielded it in a manner similar to a sword, instead of how one would hold a brush. During his youth, Kanjuro used a sword to cut hair off from people and corpses in order to use them to make brushes. Kanjuro could use Busoshoku Haki, known in Wano as \"Ryuo\", which he used to reinforce his ink brush to help Zoro and Kin'emon push back the Birdcage. Kanjuro's Busoshoku Haki was strong enough to defend against the Birdcage's razor sharp threads that can easily slice cannon balls, meteorites, and large buildings. Kanjuro possessed the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

His sideburns were gray but the upper half of the back and top were black. He wore a lighter colored robe and coat and no longer wore his necklace.", "personality": "Cobra was a fair man, who cared for his kingdom and people even after their rebellion, knowing their misled coup was still only rooted in a desire to preserve the welfare of the Arabastan people. He was loyal to the line of Arabastan kings and the Dynasty, and was willing to face death to prevent Crocodile from seizing the throne. Yet, as a testament to his character, this loyalty to the monarchy is superseded by the compassion toward his subjects and he placed their survival and welfare ahead of his own, even willing to allow the occupation and possible destruction of his capital city if it meant preventing the bloodshed of his people, seeing the lives of his citizens as the true heart of his kingdom. Overall, he was objective, able to look ahead to the future and not make impulsive decisions. This was shown clearly when Koza demands that he use Dance Powder to assuage the difficulties of the current drought, and Cobra explained that other countries need rain and hoarding it themselves is not a true solution. He still remained humble, and he even bowed before the Straw Hats in the bathhouse for helping his daughter, justifying it by saying that without his clothes, he did not have his status as a king, and was doing it as a father. In addition, he was charitable, paying to support the citizens of Koza's village out of the royal family's living expenses without hesitation. Like most of the bearers of the Will of D., Cobra isnt afraid of death as he was ready to give his life to protect Sabo and pass the legacy of D. He tried to raise his daughter humbly and somewhat as a normal child, as he was not overly upset whenanother childgot into a physical fight with Vivi, as well as letting Vivi simply refer to him as \"dad\". He let Vivi have a lot of freedom as a child and play with commoner children. However, he still worried a lot about her and often sneaked after her to check if she was doing okay. Like most fathers, he also wanted what he thinks is best for his daughter and tried to persuade Vivi into finding a husband before he passed away from his illness, but Cobra's words fell on deaf ears as Vivi told him to send the suitors away, still wishing to remain a free spirit like the Straw Hats. Vivi also berated her father on using his illness as an excuse for her to marry. He also appeared to have a mischievous side, telling the Straw Hats where the women's baths were so they could peep at Nami and his daughter.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king of Arabasta, a member of the World Government, Cobra had full authority over his subjects and was allowed to attend the Levely. In addition to his royal authority over all of Arabasta's troops, Cobra was a reasonably athletic man in his youth, enough to help Igaram fight members of Agotogi's gang hand-to-hand. Though apparently lacking any formal combat training, he even exercised a \"technique\" known as the King Chop (, Kingu Choppu?) on subjects who annoyed him, up to and including his own ministers. By the time of Operation Utopia, he had become infirm enough to be easily manhandled by Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas (as well as Miss All-Sunday). At the same time, he still possessed enough stamina to survive being crucified through the elbows for several hours. Some time after the Straw Hat Pirates left Arabasta, he became severely ill, and confined to a wheelchair.

Ryuma's mouth is partially covered by the blue scarf he wears, his black hair has turned white, and he keeps Shusui strapped to his right hip.", "personality": "In life, Ryuma followed a strict personal philosophy centered around justice and honor. Ryuma strongly believed that saving a life was a debt that must be repaid by those with virtue, and that repaying this debt was the way of a true swordsman. To this end, Ryuma would occasionally follow the request of someone he owed almost blindly, even when it contradicted his other beliefs. He also believed that a battle should be measured by what was protected instead of how much fame was gained. As a swordsman, Ryuma had a peculiar habit: whenever someone touched their sword sheath with his, even by accident, Ryuma would immediately take this action as a form of challenge for a duel to the death. This behavior stems from Ryuma's belief that the sword is the swordsman. Despite his honorable intentions, this habit would get him into needless and bloody confrontations. Ryuma, having heard the reputation of \"King\", hoped to one day fight against him. He believed that this King must hold a great \"Warrior's Soul\" and would make a worthy adversary. The irony, however, is that he himself was \"King\"; because the name, \"King\", was given to him by the people he saved, he unfortunately did not know it himself. Ryuma also had poor money management skills. Because of this, Ryuma would often unfortunately find himself penniless and hungry for days. As a zombie, Ryuma has mannerisms similar to those of Brook, such as his perverted nature and his distinct \"Yohohohoho\" laugh. These similarities exist because he has Brook's shadow animating his corpse. Though Ryuma has Brook's core personality, he possesses a slightly different outlook on things. He has abandoned his past as a part of Brook, and every memory connected with it; because of this, while Brook cherishes his afro, Ryuma sees it only as an eyesore. Ryuma also sees it as a weakness of Brook's to be exploited in their duel. He also has a decidedly sadistic streak, behaving quite cruelly towards his \"former master\" Brook; when fighting him, Ryuma seems to enjoy inflicting both physical and psychological pain, as well as toying with him when he could have won quickly and easily, being the far more powerful of the two. He seems to retain a fondness for battle that is more in line with his body's samurai origins. He felt deep shame about himself after being defeated by Zoro.", "abilities_and_powers": "Ryuma possessed immense physical strength, as the force he applied in his swordsmanship allowed him to decapitate an enormous dragon with a single slash. He also cut a copper statue in half. Ryuma was also an extremely fast runner with high endurance, as he could sprint great distances, and could jump to and land safely from great heights. His physical prowess supplemented with his sword skills allowed him to sustain no injuries during his battle in Monsters. Ryuma was well-regarded in Wano Country for his immense mastery of swordsmanship. At some point in time after his death, he came to be known as the \"Sword God\" (, Tjin-sama?) in Wano, with his skills continuing to be regarded as legendary even centuries after his death. Ryuma was a powerful Strong Blade (, Gken?)-type swordsman whose swordplay resembled a mix of kenjutsu and battojutsu. He could slice through copper, kill Cyrano (a first-rate swordsman), and an enormous dragon with little effort. He was renowned as the strongest swordsman of his time, and due to this as well as his strong belief in protecting others, Ryuma was also called \"King,\" the swordsman who carries the world's greatest \"Warrior's Soul\". As a zombie that possesses Brook's shadow, Ryuma can perform all of Brook's sword techniques. However, because Ryuma has a much stronger body than Brook does, the power of the techniques is amplified to a much higher level. The difference between the two is large enough that Ryuma could defeat Brook with only a fraction of his full strength. In addition to Brook's sword skills, Ryuma possessed immense strength that allowed him to knock out Nami, Usopp and Chopper in one attack, using the blunt edge of his blade; if he had used the sharp edge, he would have killed them. Because of this immense power, he can pierce through walls at a distance with the air pressure from his stab, completely cut through the spire roof of a tower with a single slash, and destroy an enemy's sword after just a few clashes, all things that Brook cannot do. As Brook noted, Zoro and Ryuma were of the same build as swordsmen. If they were to have equal physical strength, their destructive power would be close enough to each other to cause any duel between them to end very quickly. At some point in time of his life, Ryuma came to possess a sword called Shusui, one of the 21 Great Swords. It is distinguished by its black blade and flower-shaped guard. The sword remained with him even after he died. After Zoro defeated him, Ryuma gave the sword to him in hopes of satisfying the sword. Due to its association with Ryuma, Shusui is considered the national treasure of Wano Country. Before obtaining Shusui, Ryuma wielded a sword with a guard similar to that of Yubashiri that he used during his famous fight against the dragon. Ryuma in his life possessed \"Ryuo\", another term for Busoshoku Haki in Wano. Although his proficiency with it has not been revealed, after several battles wielding Shusui, he was able to turn it into a permanent Black Blade."},
{"name": "Shimotsuki Yasuie", "episode": "Episode 929", "chapter": "Chapter 916", "year": 2019, "note": "His real name was revealed in Chapter 941 by Kanjuro.", "appearance": "Yasuie was a thin short man with a thick spherical head. He had tiny blush marks on his cheeks, stubble around his mouth, and a thin mustache on his upper lip. Like the other residents of Ebisu Town, he was always smiling due to eating a SMILE. His epithet came from how his thick blue afro spiked out like hedgehog spines. Kanjuro and Shinobu did not recognize him until they saw it. As Tonoyasu, his hair was covered by a bandana with purple polka-dots and tied in a top knot. He wore an orange kimono with stitched patches and waraji sandals. Over 25 years ago, Yasu's face was much cleaner and less spherical; he wore a dotted kimono with a dark robe over it. He also appeared to be much taller than he was in the current storyline.", "personality": "Yasuie was always shown smiling. He was very easily excited, as he gushed over Zoro's accomplishments and showered the swordsman with compliments. He could also be self-deprecating, as he did not object when Zoro accidentally referred to him as \"Kasu\" (trash) instead of \"Yasu\". Though eccentric, carefree, and fun loving, Yasuie was extremely kind and compassionate, using the money his daughter earned to support the citizens of Ebisu Town, providing provisions to those who are too sick and injured even if it means starving himself. He enjoyed helping people, even those as amoral as Bingo, Bongo, and Bungo. His friendly and compassionate personality gave him a strong charisma, as when he joined the conversation with Kanjuro and Shinobu about the rebellion, neither of them brought up the fact that they did not know who he was. According to Shinobu, he was a strict man in the past, but lost much of that attitude over the last 20 years. He took his position as daimyo extremely seriously, especially when it came to protecting the Habu Port. In much of the same way, he expected Kozuki Oden to devote his time proving himself as Sukiyaki's heir. He was also extremely generous as not only did he give away all the money to most of the future Nine Red Scabbards tried to steal, he also gave them extra money and encouraged them to buy books to educate themselves for the sake of supporting Oden. He was also perceptive as he was hesitant believe Orochi's claim that Oden stole money from him, knowing that Oden was not the kind of person who would hide his misdeeds. Yasuie was proud of his deeds as Tonoyasu. With his last breath, he declared to die not as a daimyo of the Kozuki Family but as a fun-loving jester of Ebisu Town.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the daimyo of Hakumai, he had control over the region and its inhabitants until he lost the position. In the present day, he showed himself to be very conniving and well-spoken, tricking authorities into believing he was Ushimitsu Kozo in order to give himself a platform to trick Orochi and forces."},

He always wears a gray yukata and sometimes he has a beige haori over it with two crossed swords on the left breast.", "personality": "He was a believer that females are naturally weaker than their male counterparts and are therefore unsuitable to be warriors. Koushirou deeply appreciates talent as shown when he noted that as long as Zoro valued his swordsmanship, he did not care if he had become a pirate. However, he was rather dismayed that the students of his dojo hoped to become great pirates like Zoro and started practicing Three Sword Style to better emulate him. Although he is always seen smiling, he gives the impression of being a mostly emotionless person. Koushirou's reaction to his daughter's death was just a comment that \"humans are fragile\" when telling Zoro that she died, though it is possible that he was masking his pain.", "abilities_and_powers": "He is skilled enough with a sword that he can teach others to use it. Having learnt from his father, who was a samurai, Koushirou has knowledge of swordsmanship techniques known only in Wano which he would pass on to Zoro."},

{"name": "Shiki", "episode": "Episode ", "chapter": "Chapter 426", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Sengoku in Chapter 530.", "appearance": "Shiki is a very tall elderly man dressed in traditional Japanese clothes consisting of an orange trimmed, a red and black kimono robe tied together with a dark green sash, and a golden chain around his waist; he also wears a yellow striped tattered haori coat draped over his shoulders. He has golden mane-like hair, reaching down to the ground, and on the top of his head is part of a steering wheel that got lodged into his head after his battle with Roger. The doctor has noted that trying to remove it could result in death, as it is lodged too deep. Shiki himself thought he looked like a rooster without realizing that it was himself when looking into a mirror. As for his facial features, he sports a golden bushy tuft of hair for a beard at the bottom of his chin, and a black goatee with pointed edges surrounding his mouth. His eyebrows are dark and pointed as well, and he has some purple spots on the left side of his face right around his right eye that indicates his age. He is usually seen smoking a cigar. Twenty years ago, his hair covered the now bald top part of his head, and the coat on his shoulders had a different pattern, with big flower-like motifs on it. Instead of using more conventional prosthesis after cutting off his own legs to escape Impel Down, he uses his own swords as prosthetic legs, which he openly shows.", "personality": "Shiki is an ambitious man with a strong desire to rule the world, believing that, together with Roger, he could have easily done so. He values power, and respects those who have it, enemy or not. For this reason, he believed Roger being executed in the East Blue, the weakest of the Four Blues, was nothing short of humiliating considering the status the Pirate King had attained. According to Garp, he is not the type of person who could tolerate a peaceful era for long, but also added that Shiki would not instigate something big without extensive planning and preparation beforehand. This strongly implies that Shiki had the drive and mindset of a warmonger. Shiki has a knack for planning, often coming up with grandiose ones that can be incredibly long-term, and even Whitebeard seems to warily view him in this regard. He is also usually a calm person at most times and upon being notified by Doctor Indigo that the development of the SIQ formula on the fauna of all sixteen floating islands would require a period of twenty years to accomplish, Shiki was completely happy to wait that long, indicating a high degree of patience and devotion to maintaining his plans. Occasionally though, his anger and wrath would cause him to perform reckless maneuvers that contradicted his cunning mentality. Shiki was also shown to be a very charismatic and capable leader, managing to develop pirate armadas on at least two occasions in his career (the first was commented as being an exceptionally large fleet even in the New World; the Whitebeard Pirates division total is 1,600 pirates as a comparison, and the second looked to be nearly as large had Shiki not been stopped prematurely); he also treated his direct crew with compassion and respect, as if they were his own family, though he was not above killing lesser subordinates for the most superficial of reasons. Shiki often comes off as very light-hearted and comical. He takes most things with a cheerful smile and even getting a steering wheel stuck in his head, losing half his Pirate fleet to Roger, or cutting off his feet did not bring him down much. The only thing Shiki has ever shown fear of are storms, possibly because his fleet was once devastated by one when battling the Roger Pirates, but more likely due to the fact that not even he has full control of his flying masses when in the midst of one. Shiki also seems to be a little bit absent-minded, as he often mistakes things for other things, such as a giant stormy cloud for a perm, a bird for a guitar, or Scarlet the gorilla for his grandmother. He apparently likes to dance, as when first introduced to Nami he was seen performing a dance with Indigo and Scarlet. The three of them often act as a comical trio. Like other characters in One Piece, Shiki has a distinct laugh: \"Jihahahaha\" (?). In the English version of Strong World, he speaks with a Jamaican accent.", "abilities_and_powers": "Shiki commanded a large pirate crew of at least 51 divisions, somewhat similar to the Krieg Pirates and the Whitebeard Pirates, showcasing considerable military might. It is unknown how strong his crew was, but what is known is that the largest pirate fleet was under his control at that time. During Roger's era, Shiki was one of the most powerful pirate figures of the time, being on par with Sengoku, Garp, Whitebeard, and Roger as a living legend. Before that era, Shiki was a member of the Rocks Pirates, a powerful crew whose members included three of the future Emperors and was notable enough to be known as a feared peer within the group. He fought and stood his ground in a fight against Garp and Admiral Sengoku at once, two of the most powerful Marines in existence, and their fight destroyed half the city, although he ended up being defeated, he came out with only a few bruises. Shiki is also the first prisoner to escape from Impel Down on his own without help. Whereas Luffy later had to enlist the help of Ivankov, Jinbe, Crocodile, and over two hundred other prisoners to escape, his feat remains unique in the history. Ultimately, Shiki was not seriously injured and was able to emerge practically unscathed from the prison, only losing his legs(which he cut off himself to free himself from the Seastone). Alongside Roger and Whitebeard, Shiki is one of the most powerful pirates of his generation and showed incredible physical might. He has tremendous physical strength supplemented with his supreme sword skills, allowing him to slay an army of Marines alone at Marineford. After capture, he was imprisoned in Level 6 of Impel Down and survived in prison despite his injuries from the previous battle. He has a massive level of endurance as he could survive having parts of a steering wheel permanently embedded deep into his head, a feat that impressed Indigo, and an immense tolerance to pain. After he amputated his own legs to break free of Seastone shackles, Shiki was completely unfazed by the pain, even casually smoking a cigar as he joked around with Hannyabal. Without any medical treatment and with profuse and heavy bleeding, he successfully broke out of the impenetrable security defenses of Impel Down single-handedly. Later, in a crude form of emergency treatment, Shiki forcefully grafted his swords into the inner stumps of his amputated legs. Despite shedding even more blood, Shiki simply shrugged it off. Even in old age, Shiki remained extremely powerful despite his strength having waned over time. He could block Sanji's kicks with one hand and negated Zoro's powerful slashes with his legs and sent him crashing to the ground with one crushing punch. He could fight on par with Luffy in his Gear 2 mode and withstand several attacks in turn. He also withstood Chopper's Kokutei Roseo Metel with almost no damage at all. Shiki was also considerably crafty and resourceful as a pirate, able to remain hidden from the World Government for 20 years despite his famed status while putting his plan into action. Within his compound, Shiki had a communication network set across his chain of floating islands to monitor general surface activity and had established a base of operations within Merveille to accommodate his vast armada for decades. Shiki also had access to the SIQ formula developed by his crewmate Doctor Indigo, with an entire laboratory located on Merveille dedicated to its further research. Shiki was also shown to be a very charismatic and capable leader, managing to develop pirate armadas on at least two occasions in his career (the first was commented as being an exceptionally large fleet even in the New World; the Whitebeard Pirates division total is 1,600 pirates as a comparison, and the second looked to be nearly as large had Shiki not been stopped prematurely). Shiki possesses tremendous skills in swordsmanship as he dual-wielded Oto and Kogarashi to single-handedly massacre an entire army of Marines before getting subdued by Garp and Sengoku. After the two swords had become his prosthetic legs, not only did he have little difficulty in standing or walking while using them, but he is also capable of attacking from a distance with them by sending slashes from his sword legs in a Rankyaku-like fashion. These air-blades have a light-yellow/gold color-scheme, matching his epithet. He also combines his sword skills with his Fuwa Fuwa no Mi, such as slashing open a body of water and then levitating it to drown his opponents. He fended off all the slashes from Zoro's Nanajuni Pound Ho with great speed and reflexes, and later another attack from Zoro's was countered in mid-air and he knocked Zoro back down to the ground with great force. He was also able to fight on par against Roger, and later, it took both Garp and Sengoku in their prime to capture him alive. Shiki ate the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to fly, as well as make surrounding non-living matter levitate after he has come into contact with it. Shiki states that once he makes something float, it will stay that way until either he himself undoes it or he loses consciousness. He has been shown to make several Marine vessels and even vast island areas float. However, his powers are unable to be used on any living matter other than himself, meaning he cannot levitate animals, plants, or other people. He can telekinetically manipulate any weapons, structures, and debris that he has previously made contact with, allowing him to attack his opponents with multiple flying weapons and large heavy objects, as well as form a shield to defend himself from attacks. Additionally, his ability to fly grants him a very high level of mobility. He can also use his power to freely manipulate his non-living surroundings, such as mineral, snow, and bodies of water. In addition to simply floating them, he can levitate them into intricate shapes, such as gigantic lion heads, which he can use to attack his opponents. His ability to levitate things can also be used to bind people in a vast amount non-living material, and even drown people by floating a large amount of water all around them. In the beginning segments of \"Strong World\", Shiki is revealed to have converted a small island into his personal flagship with the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi's powers. Because of this, apart from serving as the crew's captain, Shiki also acts as their helmsman and as such, any change in course of trajectory that must occur first has to be relayed by the crew to Shiki to conduct the change of direction. Shiki possesses two double-edged swords by the names of Oto and Kogarashi, which according to him were famous. In the past, he used them like regular swords, but after escaping Impel Down, he replaced his severed legs with them. Despite the cumbersome appearance, Shiki has no trouble with his balance or walking capacity. He was also seen using a flintlock pistol on various occasions and seems to be quite accurate with it."},
{"name": "Shepherd Ju Peter", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 1086.", "appearance": "Ju Peter is a tan-skinned man of lean build and incredible stature, being the second tallest of the Five Elders after Marcus Mars (and noticeably taller than Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, hence well over 3m tall). Among the Elders, Ju Peter stands out as the youngest-looking, with a full head of hair and little in the way of facial wrinkles. Said hair is blond and kept in a regular, short taper cut while linking to a full beard-and-mustache combo. For attire, Ju Peter dons a plain suit jacket and pants of dark-maroon color, paired with a white, buttoned-up, tieless dress shirt that has a wingtip collar low enough to expose a scar above his chest, which reaches from his lower cervical area down toward his right armpit.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Ju Peter cares about the world's balance upheld by the Three Great Powers and wishes to protect it, expressly seeking to prevent the chaos that would arise from its breakdown. He has been shown to give great thought to the impact of vacancies created among both the Seven Warlords and Four Emperors. He also wishes to preserve the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret at all costs, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it; notably, Ju Peter was the one who gave the order to kill Professor Clover of Ohara, doing so to prevent the latter from uttering the Great Kingdom's name. Like his fellow Elders, Ju Peter is knowledgeable regarding the true nature of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and takes said Devil Fruit's threat quite seriously. When Warcury made note of its legendary status, Ju Peter responded by questioning why the government made the effort of renaming a Devil Fruit. Although he will totally obey Imu's orders, he did not shy away from questioning the reasoning behind eliminating an entire country, though he did proceed the process regardless of the question and executed Imu's orders.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Five Elders, the highest-ranking Celestial Dragons, Ju Peter and his four peers are considered the \"Highest Authority of the World Government\", though in secret are subservient to Imu, the occupant of the Empty Throne. Ju Peter thus controls every part of the government, including but not limited to the Cipher Pol agencies and Marine HQ, with even the Fleet Admiral unable to challenge the Elder's power. Like anyone of or below the rank of Marine Admiral, the Five Elders can declare a Buster Call to destroy any island deemed a threat, as well as deploy the Mother Flame on behalf of Imu to annihilate islands without a trace. The Elders can also channel their tremendous power to manipulate the media, such as to withhold facts from the general public or outright erase segments of history, most notably regarding the Void Century. Ju Peter has an unspecified ability allowing him to transform into a giant, humanoid creature with a large mouth. In this form, he could withstand a point-blank fire blast from Sabo without trouble. It is unknown if this power is derived from a Zoan-type Devil Fruit. Ju Peter carries a flintlock with him, which he intended to use to execute Nefertari Cobra for seeing Imu."},
{"name": "Sheepshead", "episode": "Episode 795", "chapter": "Chapter 739", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Sheepshead is a muscular man of tall height with short, light blonde, slicked-back hair and two small black horns on his head like other Gifters. He wears goggles over his eyes and an open black cloak that exposes his bare chest with three straps on his abs and he also wears frilled shoulder pads with furred cape and a chain holding it, and also appears to wear fingerless gloves. There is a scar running the length of his chest, and his left forearm is entirely tattooed with circles with single dots on it. He wears a frilled belt with the Beasts Pirates' Jolly Roger on it and long black pants with knee pads and black boots. When activating his Sheep SMILE his hair becomes long and curly and both hands transforms into ram horns. While using his Devil Fruit powers, his hair becomes longer and curlier, resembling sheep's wool.", "personality": "Sheepshead is very eager to kill his opponents, and will not stop until they are dead or he is no longer be able to fight. He is sadistic and loves violence, having relentlessly pursued Tristan with the intention of torturing her after the destruction of the Mokomo Dukedom and the interrogation of its inhabitants. He takes offense to people not showing proper respect when talking to his superiors and sometimes fixates on small details for no reason, such as when he berated Ginrummy for calling Raizo a samurai when she was merely using the term colloquially.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Shinuchi of the Gifters, Sheepshead holds a high position in the Beasts Pirates andhas authority over them and other lower-ranking members of the crew, and he was even shown with the authority to give orders to other Shinuchi like Ginrummy.Sheepshead is a competent fighter, having countered Brook's freezing Soul Parade without any visible difficulty; however, Sanji managed to defeat him with a single Diable Jambe attack when Brook stalled him. Sheepshead ate a Sheep SMILE (, Hitsuji no Sumairu?, literally meaning \"Sheep Artificial Devil Fruit\"), an artificial Devil Fruit known as SMILE, which grants him the ability to transform his hands into the horns of a sheep. Sheepshead was able to activate and deactivate his powers at will thanks to his advanced control over his fruit. Sheepshead carries a large sword on his back which he used to try and attack Nami, however, Brook was able to counter the attack using his own sword. He appears to be proficient in its use and wields it skillfully. Although much was not see of its use while he was in battle, when going to attack Nami he held the sword in a reverse grip."},

{"name": "Shanks", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 3", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Shanks is a tall, muscular man with a tan complexion. Among the original lineup of the Four Emperors, he stood out as the smallest, most normal-sized human by far, the others being inhumanly proportioned to varying degrees. True to his epithet, Shanks has distinctly red hair, usually depicted across media as a deep crimson. Worthy of note is that, uniquely among all characters seen so far, even ones with a comparable hair tone, Shanks' hair is the sole one filled with grayscale in the black-and-white manga (instead of inked black or left white). Shanks' first-seen hairstyle was a straight, middle-parted one kept loosely down to nape length, with shorter (at eye level), curtained bangs in the front. In later appearances (at ten years older), he is shown with slightly longer hair, wavier and more slicked back than before except for some few strands he lets fall down the sides of his face, pushed farther sideward than said prior bangs. On his face resides a secondary trademark: a triple set of parallel, linear scars that pass vertically, at an angle over his left (untouched) eye, revealed to have been given to him by Blackbeard some unknown time before the start of the series. Additionally, Shanks' left arm is missing from below the deltoid, as a result of him saving Luffy from a Sea King when the future Straw Hat captain was just a child. As did his hair, Shanks' face changes as the manga's art style progresses: initially, it appeared more youthful, a soft jawline tapering down to a small, pointy chin. Its features were similarly milder than later depictions and, save for his small nose, also larger, most so his plain black eyes, topped by thin brows. Later appearances show him more markedly countenanced, the square of his jaw, the sharper, narrower pair of eyes, and the chiseled, more prominently bridged nose lending him a manlier appearance. More consistently stays his facial hair, however, as he has always kept it in a neatly thin connection of beard and mustache stubble, forming the beginnings of a circle beard. Clothes-wise, Shanks used to wear a certain straw hat obtained from Gol D. Roger (his former captain) that was synonymous with his image until he passed it on to Luffy. Otherwise, Shanks' outfit always includes a sweeping long, sleeveless, high-collared cape of black color (in the anime bearing a lighter, gray inside) and beneath a simple, white shirt half-buttoned up, exposing the middle of his chest and upper abs. Additionally, Shanks is always wearing pants cut below the knee, collected halfway up the shin. Initially, the pair was a slightly loose, plain brown one with golden buttons down the outer leg sides, and with a red sash around his waist to keep his shirt tucked inside. Later on, Shanks is wearing a different, mildly baggier pair of pants with a green-yellow, indiscernible floral pattern (now revealing plenty leg hair), and his shirt is left out of his sash, which is now shown holding his saber at his right side. Finally, his footwear consists of simple brown sandals, their soles gray studded. After the timeskip, he is at some point wearing different pants yet again, light-colored with a rose pattern. From 9 to 14 years old, Shanks was already used to wearing Roger's straw hat and had a similar, longish hairstyle in a middle part as his present one. His clothes were simple, including white, either plain or pinstriped shirts, occasionally a buckled shoulder belt of brown leather, an orange waist sash holding a green-hilted saber reminiscent of Gryphon, and simple (red or blue) shorts.", "personality": "Shanks is an extremely laid-back man, preferring to take his time by traveling around the world with his crew while enjoying himself as opposed to rushing from one place to another. This was already the case in his youth, where he was portrayed as playful and innocent in contrast to the grumpy and opportunistic Buggy, his fellow apprentice. However, Shanks still suffered from occasional bouts of immaturity, starting trivial arguments with Buggy solely out of stubbornness. In many ways, Shanks was very similar to Luffy (as a child) in his younger years. Shanks and his crew are almost always partying and drinking alcoholic beverages, as the captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets. He is even able to waver the resolve of prominent figures, such as Dracule Mihawk to join in with his fun, as a testament to his strong charisma. Shanks is endlessly fond of parties and will start them for all sorts of occasions (regardless of whether he had already partied beforehand), as he did when he finally met Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace. Shanks is also quite the jokester and has a penchant for teasing others. Despite his outward simplicity, Shanks bears a rather complex moral code. His aversion to conflict has led him to believe that if personal opinions conflict, no matter how close the individuals may be, it is better for them to part ways. It is indicative that Shanks prefers others to see him as someone who cares little about his own well-being, preferring to laugh off even dire situations as opposed to taking direct conflict. His carefree nature ends, however, when those under his leadership or protection are threatened, which extends to those he views as friends. As one of the Four Emperors, Shanks acknowledges that he too has a reputation to maintain and will hunt after those that dare cause trouble on his territories. As noted by the Five Elders, Shanks is a pacifist by nature who does not actively seek to cause chaos and disorder. He is also against the idea of needless bloodshed, even if honor is involved, and so far seems to only step up for a fight when a friend is in danger. He seems to admire those who display extreme bravery for the sake of humanitarian reasons, having protected and commended Koby for gathering his courage to stop the Summit War of Marineford in front of the ruthless Marine Admiral Akainu, as the young Marine believed that it was pointless to continue fighting and treating the wounded should be prioritized. While Shanks seems to always favor peaceful solutions, he will stand up and fight if the enemy leaves him no choice or if he wants to avoid further destruction to places he cares about. Unlike the some of his fellow Emperors, Shanks is not arrogant and is fully capable of acknowledging the threat his enemies can pose. In his talk with Whitebeard, Shanks admitted the scar he got from Blackbeard was not because of a mistake on his part, but proof of Blackbeard's power at the time. This allowed Shanks to understand Blackbeard had been biding his time onboard Whitebeard's ship to build up his power until he was ready to make his move. Despite his own immense strength, he does not underestimate his opponents, using Future Vision before fighting Eustass Kid and quickly assaulting him when he saw Kid's attack. When he decides that he needs to fight, he is ruthless, having the Victoria Punk destroyed and seemingly wiping out the Kid Pirates. This aspect makes Shanks more harder to defeat compared to other Emperors such as Kaidou, Big Mom and Blackbeard; he will not give his opponent any openings or play around with them. Instead, he will properly crush them. Shanks also has skills in diplomacy, which coupled with his status as one of the Four Emperors, means that his words usually carry enormous weight for those aware of his reputation. He brokered a ceasefire between the Whitebeard Pirates and the World Government because he knew that joining the fight himself would have tipped it against the Marines. Shanks managed to convince Sengoku, the then Marine Fleet Admiral, to agree with his proposition, even though Sengoku has a strong hatred for pirates. Despite being calm and brave most of the time, Shanks is sometimes surprisingly careless, acting and reacting in ways that are not always fitting to what others expect from him, a trait noted by Buggy to be \"endlessly annoying\". Those include panicking when things go wrong or shrugging off Buggy's angry disposition towards him to greet him in a friendly manner. That said, Shanks can be surprisingly serious and mature while dealing with certain topics, which runs opposite to his normal, fun-loving persona. It has been noted that he has problems relaxing while in enemy territory, causing his Haoshoku Haki to burst out of his control, even though, outwardly, Shanks appears fine. Like many of his rival pirates, Shanks has interest in obtaining the One Piece, stating his intention to start battling for it after the downfall of two of his fellow Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom. Additionally, Shanks is also aware that he needs the Road Poneglyphs to achieve this goal and therefore does not shy away from fighting for the copies himself. Having traveled around the world, Shanks believes the best sake can be found in his hometown in the West Blue, indicating a nostalgic streak. During his encounter with Whitebeard, he referred to alcohol as \"healing water\". Like other characters in One Piece, Shanks has his own unique laugh, starting it with a \"Da\" (i.e., Dahahahahaha!).", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Four Emperors, Shanks is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, and proof of that is he has a bounty of 4,048,900,000, which is the highest among the current Emperors. According to Buggy, Shanks' immense potential was visible since their days as pirate apprentices in the Roger Pirates and thought Shanks would succeed Roger as the next Pirate King. While Shanks was not interested in reaching Laugh Tale at the time, he still quickly made a powerful name for himself, gaining an impressive bounty of 1,040,000,000 twelve years before the main story. During this time, he competed with Dracule Mihawk, the \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\", in daily duels that were described as legendary. It is also important to mention that Shanks was able to reach the rank of Emperor even after losing one of his arms, and is also the only one among them, in the original and current lineup, to not have the powers of a Devil Fruit. Kaidou, who is renowned as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Shanks in the same elite class as other legendary pirates, that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Rocks D. Xebec, Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, and his former captain. As proof of this, he stopped Kaidou from attacking Whitebeard a day before the Summit War of Marineford and later joined Marineford himself a day later. Rockstar also used his captain's name to convey to Whitebeard the importance of the letter he delivered to him. Admiral Akainu fought through Whitebeard's many divisional commanders, two former Warlords of the Sea, and even Whitebeard himself, but did not challenge Shanks when he appeared. Members of the Worst Generation such as Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, and Basil Hawkins had to ally with each other to have a possibility of overthrowing Shanks. Admiral Ryokugyu chose to pull back his attempt on Luffy after he realized Shanks was present outside of Wano Country. Another testament to Shanks' strength is that he was able to defeat Eustass Kid, a powerful pirate whose bounty is worth 3,000,000,000 and one of the two pirates responsible for defeating former Emperor Big Mom, with a single attack. The name of Shanks alone commands great power, as Buggy himself proved. His assertion that he previously had a \"brotherly bond\" with Shanks was one of the many things that earned him respect from the Impel Down inmates. In addition, Buggy did not shy from using the names of Shanks and his previous captain, Gol D. Roger, to maintain his respect among them. Even the fact that Buggy was seen back talking to Shanks was seen as a testament of Buggy's power to the former prisoners, who were not aware that the two had always acted like this and mistakenly thinking that it was because Buggy was not afraid of an Emperor. Shanks commands enough power to end the war at Marineford with just words. When he stated that there was to be no more fighting, no one stepped up to challenge him, even though the Marines were fired up after the death of Ace and Whitebeard. Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter stated that Shanks is one of the few people capable of stopping Blackbeard. This faith was proven valid because when Shanks asked Blackbeard if he intended to confront him, he stopped fighting and ordered his crew to retreat, despite having acquired the powers of the Gura Gura no Mi along with his original power and also strengthened his crew with many of the most powerful prisoners of Impel Down's sixth level. Furthermore, when Shanks requested that Whitebeard and Ace's dignity at death not be violated, Sengoku himself decided to call off the war and offered to take responsibility, showing that despite being a pirate, Shanks has earned Sengoku's respect, something that no pirate other than the late Whitebeard is known to have achieved. Shanks also possesses enough influence to gain an audience with the Five Elders, who like the leaders of the World Government, would normally consider him an enemy. According to Brannew, one of Shanks' greatest attributes is his leadership and charisma, having managed to earn the absolute trust and loyalty of the most talented and capable individuals from the four seas and Grand Line all noted for having particularly high bounties and recruited them into his crew. The most prominent are his officers: Benn Beckman of North Blue, Yasopp of East Blue, and Lucky Roux of South Blue. This made Shanks' crew extremely well balanced and impregnable, able to contend equally with the enormous military power of Charlotte Linlin's Big Mom Pirates, Kaidou's Beasts Pirates, and Edward Newgate's Whitebeard Pirates. Shanks is incredibly skilled at infiltration and stealth, as shown when he successfully managed to infiltrate Mary Geoise by wearing only a cloak, a noteworthy feat considering that for most pirates, entering through Mary Geoise without being invited or enslaved is practically considered an impossible and unthinkable feat. He also avoided detection from the many guards and marines present. Shanks is an excellent swimmer, having once swam deep into the ocean depths to save Buggy from drowning. He is pretty fast at swimming as well, able to rescue Luffy in the open ocean from a Sea King attack. Shanks possesses immense physical strength as he was once a rival to Dracule Mihawk, a master swordsman with tremendous power that could overwhelm Zoro in terms of brute force with immense ease. Even with only one arm, Shanks can apply tremendous power to his swordsmanship, able to easily match Whitebeard, a gigantic man who could completely overpower giants and an entire army of powerful and skilled Marine officers. With his physical strength combined with Busoshoku Haki, Shanks could defend against Akainu's magma fist, which has extremely destructive offensive power. He also has extraordinary leg strength, as he was able to leap from his ship all the way to the Victoria Punk despite the two ships being miles apart in distance. Shanks possesses tremendous levels of endurance and tolerance to pain. Even after having his arm bitten off by a Sea King that attempted to devour Luffy, Shanks was completely unfazed despite the heavy bleeding and simply used Haoshoku Haki to scare off the Sea King. Shanks is also extremely fast, as shown when he intercepted Akainu's attack before he could kill Koby, despite having just arrived at Marineford. On Elbaf, Shanks leaped from his ship to the Victoria Punk in an instant before Kid could fire his Damned Punk. As the former rival of Dracule Mihawk, the \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\", Shanks is an immensely skilled swordsman. Prior to losing his left arm, he competed in ruthless duels on a daily basis with Mihawk. Even after losing his arm, Shanks is able to match a blow from Whitebeard which is a testament to his prowess in swordsmanship. He is also powerful enough to easily block Akainu's magma fist using only his sword and Busoshoku Haki. Along with his mastery of Haki, he could replicate the techniques of his former captain Roger, having enough power and skill to defeat both Kidd and Killer in a single attack. Shanks apparently favored his left arm for combat before he lost it, as he is always seen holding his sword in his left hand during flashbacks. As such, he is presumed to have been left-handed or at least ambidextrous before losing said limb. Shanks is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. Even Whitebeard complimented Shanks for his Haki when he used it on his visit, with Jozu stating it was overwhelming. Shanks possesses immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki, a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use. It was first hinted sometime after his introduction, before the reveal of Haki, with him intimidating a Sea King with a single glare, causing it to flee for its life. When boarding the Moby Dick, the main ship of Edward Newgate, Shanks was capable of knocking dozens of his men unconscious, many of whom were seasoned men able to survive the New World, while the flagship itself, a ship able to survive the harsh conditions of the New World, was damaged from the sheer force of his presence, impressing those around him. Shanks' Haoshoku Haki was at least twice as potent as Luffy's by the time of the Fish-Man Island Arc. While Luffy only knocked out 50,000 of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Shanks could have knocked out all 100,000. During the Wano Country Arc, he released a massive burst of Haoshoku Haki that paralyzed Admiral Ryokugyu, stopping him in his tracks from miles away at sea without needing to step foot into the country. Both Jinbe and Yamato stated that such a display of Haki was monstrous. Non-canonically, in One Piece Film: Red Shanks' Haoshoku is also capable of affecting a few Vice Admirals, causing them to fall to their knees, although Admirals Kizaru and Fujitora seemed unaffected. Most notably, he is among the small \"handful\" of people capable of \"infusing\" Haoshoku Haki into their body or weapons, his sword Gryphon in particular, as signified by the thin streams of black lightning radiating from it. However, Shanks' use of this ability seems to be much more potent compared to the likes of Big Mom, as he defeated Eustass Kid and Killer in a single Haoshoku Haki-infused attack, the latter took much less of the actual impact, while causing collateral damage to their ship and crew. This is a notable representation of Shanks' power because Kid and Killer both took a number of attacks from Big Mom and her Homies, and both had recovered from their previous battle against the Emperors on Onigashima. When Shanks and Whitebeard collided, it made the heavens split in half. Shanks is an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. During the Summit War of Marineford, his Haki-imbued sword easily blocked Akainu's magma-enhanced punch, which was powerful enough to burn enemies such as Ace, Jinbe, and even the Emperor Whitebeard. Shanks is an immensely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki. He was able to sense a \"weird presence\" while he was miles outside Wano Country. He can also use the advanced application that allows him to briefly see into the future, as shown when he saw Kid prepare an attack to eliminate all the ships of his affiliates. Shanks wields a sword named Gryphon in combat. It is a large saber with a single edge blade and a large hand guard. He can coat his sword in a \"fiery\" aura and use it against his enemies. Shanks has wielded four different swords at various points in the past aside from Gryphon. He used two different swords during his time as an apprentice pirate aboard Gol D. Roger's ship (one around the time Buggy ate the Bara Bara no Mi and another during a clash with the Whitebeard Pirates) and another one during his stay in Luffy's hometown. He was seen wielding a different sword during his meeting with Ace, which means he obtained Gryphon after the encounter with Ace. In One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 and 4, Shanks wields a large firearm (either a shotgun or rifle) which he uses during certain combos. He also wields a similar weapon in One Piece: Burning Blood, though only as part of the moveset for his Strong World costume."},

The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, true to his name, he is shown to have extremely fast movements. A proof of this is when Admiral Kizaru launched a laser beam to stop him and his division from getting closer to the broken wall Oars made he was seen evading it by jumping backward, and commenting on Kizaru's \"speed of light\" attack. This is quite a remarkable feat considering the fact that Kizaru can move and shoot beams from his body without himself or his beams even getting noticed due to sheer, unmitigated speed (evidenced when X Drake fought Kizaru and just noticed a blink of light from far away, when Kizaru actually was already in front of him aiming a kick). Also, his combined strength and agility is astounding, as seen when he took the offense and dashed forward to engage the Marines: in a split second, a group of them was easily eliminated. His body structure also seems to change from time to time as shown in both the manga and anime, if this is because of a Devil Fruit, a technique like Life Return or simply a drawing mistake is unknown.

His mustache has grown considerably long, and he grew a beard. He wore his chefs uniform, with a blue ascot, and white apron. Also, since he lost his right leg, he has a peg leg and he seems to have no trouble walking with it. After two years, he wears a horizontally striped dark colored and light colored shirt, dark colored pants, and a white chefs uniform draped over his shoulders, with his ascot. He still has the same braided mustache style, and peg leg.", "personality": "Zeff was a tough former pirate. He is hard on those around him and is always serious (at times appearing frighteningly serious) about everything. Zeff normally does not show emotions other than a hot temper and has a firm hold of authority at the Baratie. Despite his fierce temper, Zeff is also very compassionate. When he and Sanji were shipwrecked on a rocky island at sea, he chose to hand over all the remaining food supply to Sanji, keeping none to himself.Due to his great compassion, Sanji even believed that Zeff wouldbe completely disgusted with him if Sanji had chosen to abandon his biological family to die by Big Mom's hands and even laugh at their demise despite how corrupt his family was along with the fact they had coerced Sanji by threateningZeff's safety. As a chef at sea, Zeff respects food to a very high degree. When he ordered his crew to plunder the Orbit, he kicked one of his crew for stealing food, the one thing he refuses to take. Also, when Sanji was still in-training at the Baratie, when his food was unsatisfactory for customers, Zeff forced Sanji to eat it himself, rather than throw it out. He also gave Krieg food for his starving crew, understanding the pain of hunger at sea, despite knowing that feeding the crew would bring a battle. At one point, Zeff stated that he disliked children. Whether this is true of him, or whether it was simply made up to persuade Sanji to join the Straw Hats remains to be seen; however, given his father-son relationship with Sanji, he certainly appears to have made the latter the exception to this aspect about him. Zeff also strongly dislikes any violence against women. For this reason, he refuses to hire any female chefs, as he tends to make his point in the kitchen using violence. He made it a point to pass this onto Sanji, insisting that men can never harm women no matter what.", "abilities_and_powers": "When Zeff was a pirate, he was renowned for being both a great chef and a powerful pirate captain who managed to traverse the Grand Line. Zeff also retains a fair amount of knowledge of the Grand Line and piracy from his days as captain, as displayed when he knew about \"The Hawk-Eyes Man\" that Gin was talking about, and the fact that he knew some people referred to the first half of the Grand Line as Paradise. He also knows perfectly well about Devil Fruits and the weaknesses that come with them. He is a highly capable teacher as he could pass on most of his fighting skills onto Sanji. As the founder and head chef of Baratie, a famous sea restaurant of the East Blue, Zeff is a master chef who possess an extremely high level of skill in cooking. He is also the one that taught Sanji all his culinary skills and knowledge about cooking. He was able to skillfully cook enough food to feed one hundred men of Krieg's crew singlehandedly within a short period of time. According to himself, Zeff has culinary experiences that extend from the four seas to the Grand Line and Sanji is still an amateur compared to himself. Zeff possesses extraordinary leg strength. He could easily break through rock and leave footprints on hard iron and overpower all his enemies effortlessly. Even after his amputation, he is able to swing his peg-leg with enough force to produce an air-current that can extinguish a half-dozen burning projectiles in mid-air.He also remains extremely agile despite his age, often enhancing his kicks with elaborate jumps. Zeff also has immense stamina and endurance, managing to survive 85 days without any sustenance apart from rainwater and his own severed leg. In his prime, Zeff was renowned as a master of extremely powerful kicks. Because of the immense power of his lethal kicks, his shoes were often coated in the blood of his enemies - hence his \"Red-Leg\" epithet. Even with a peg-leg, Zeff can still fell a grown man with one kick, and even stagger Luffy despite the Gomu Gomu no Mi's natural protections against blunt trauma. (According to Sanji, the force of Zeff's kicks far surpass Kuroobi's 40th-level Fish-Man Karate; after sustaining a \"Hundred Tile True Punch\" from the latter, he claimed that Zeff's kicks would qualify as \"400th-level\" by the same metric.) Notably (and despite training Sanji against the same), Zeff is also capable of hand-based attacks such as body-throws and punches. However, he has only been seen using these to discipline Sanji, rather than in genuine combat. During his initial meeting with Luffy, Zeff brandished a hand-saw that he \"proposed\" to sever Luffy's leg with. It is unknown if he has ever seriously used this device, for combat or any other purpose."},
{"name": "Zeo", "episode": "Episode 611", "chapter": "Chapter 530", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "As a Wobbegong shark, Zeo is a tall and thin fish-man with a strange body, covered in wavy light blue and indigo stripes, and \"02\" tattooed on his chest. Tentacle-like whiskers hang from his face, and unlike other fish-men, Zeo does not seem to have ears nor a nose, nor does he have a visible mouth. However, as he is able to speak, listen, and consume Energy Steroids, it is obvious that he has them. He sports a dorsal fin, and gills on his long neck. His legs are covered by what appears to be some sort of long inducement, with a pattern identical to his body's and the New Fish-Man Pirates' Jolly Roger in correspondence of his right knee. Around his waist is a belt with a round buckle, and his feet seem to be covered by dark boots. As a teenager, he looked almost identical, with the only differences being the smaller size, the lack of the number tattoo on his chest, not having the gill marks on the side of his neck yet, the simpler belt around his waist and the pair of loose pants he wore back then. Due to the negative effects of the Energy Steroids, his body became old and weak. He now sports a white beard resembling his tentacles, bushy eyebrows,a skinnier crooked neck,and something of a pot belly.", "personality": "Zeo has a calm and serious demeanor and appears to be one of the most intellectual members of Hody's crew, as he was responsible for the mass-production of the Energy Steroids, and also behind swaying Wadatsumi to their cause. Like his colleagues, he believes humans are cowardly creatures. Zeo also despises humans and Otohime's ideals as much as Hody Jones and the other officers. Zeo appears vicious using threats to force the Fish-Man Island citizens to comply with the New Fish-Man Pirates and accept that they can never co-exist peacefully with humans. His hatred is intense, and he believed that even if they died in failure, they can leave a grudge against humanity for the next generation of fish-men to pick up, and stood by his beliefs by forcing the lower echelons to remain behind to die, even using deadly force to achieve this. Naming himself the Noble of the Fish-Man District, he seems to be overly committed to the morals of the Fish-Man District. Even after being beaten by his subordinates (unintentionally) he still kept preaching about how their views of Otohime were wrong. He also expressed great happiness and pride when he thought that he defeated Brook. Zeo's arrogance is so deep to where he stubbornly makes excuses whenever he is humiliated and gets angered easily when corrected on his mistakes, such as when Brook accidentally stepped on his face due to his camouflage only to claim he was \"headbutting\" the latter's foot. Later, after getting stabbed, he claims it was his plan to dull the blade. He showed it again after he (along with the other officers) grew old from the effects of the Energy Steroid, claiming that he grew old on purpose.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Zeo has command over lower ranking subordinates. Zeo appears to be a skilled chemist (in making medicine at least), as Hody put him in charge of replicating and mass-producing the Energy Steroids. As a fish-man, Zeo was born with ten times the strength of an average human, and even more underwater; in fact, as an officer of the crew, his strength may be even higher. As a wobbegong fish-man, Zeo also has the power to perfectly camouflage himself to blend in with the environment. This allows him to carry out sneak attacks on unaware opponents; he tends to approach his targets while laying flat on his back upon the ground close to where his targets are. Pinpointing his location through the sound of his voice also seems rather difficult, as neither the citizens of the island nor his own underlings managed to discern his position while he was speaking loudly. Only Brook was seen being able to determine where he was in this manner. In the anime, his camouflage is depicted as turning invisible, in a manner similar to Absalom's invisibility. He also seems quite resilient, since he was (unintentionally) pummeled by his own henchmen while being invisible, due to the fact a cockroach was on his head, and despite that he still remained conscious and was willing to proceed to Gyoncorde Plaza without losing time, still voicing out the crew's ideals loudly. He was also able to stand up without too much of an effort after Brook stabbed him. However, after the negative effects of overdosing on Energy Steroids took effect, he became weak and old, stripping him of all his previous strength. Zeo's weapons of choice seems to be two large weighted chains he apparently employs like a pair of bolas, as seen in the Marine Shopping Mall on Fish-Man Island, where he accurately threw one of them to wrap around a citizen's throat, causing his target to be choked, all the while remaining completely unseen due to his camouflage abilities. In the anime, Zeo used five spears to puncture Fukaboshi's resin inner tube, delivered at high speed due to his Energy Steroid abuse. Like the rest of the crew, Zeo took Energy Steroids during the battle against the three princes of Ryugu Kingdom, who are crowned the strongest soldiers in the entire island, and was able to easily overpower them due to this. The drug doubles his strength per pill taken, but also shaves off a portion of his lifespan. The pills also eventually had the side effect of making him old and weak due to overdosing on them, robbing him of his previous strength. As the crew's chemist, Zeo is able to artificially replicate the Energy Steroids through unknown means. Due to his arrogant personality, Zeo tends to give excuses whenever he is humiliated by his opponents, claiming that instead of mistakes, his actions were actually powerful, dramatically-named attacks."},

However, Zunesha has comparatively small eyes (shown to have turquoise, ringed irises in the anime) sunken deep into their sockets, being barely visible at most times and giving the impression that it has no eyes at all. Its gray skin is heavily wrinkled, reflecting its old age, and its ears are tattered and frayed at the edges.", "personality": "Most of Zunesha's personality is a mystery, but it does not mind carrying a civilization on its back, and in fact cares greatly about the Mink Tribe. As part of the sentence for whatever crime it committed in the past, Zunesha is not allowed to do anything but wander around, requiring permission from someone who can understand it to act against threats to its well-being. Miyagi speculates that Zunesha is not walking aimlessly and may, in fact, be looking for a certain location.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zunesha has immense longevity, given its so-far more than 1000 years of life. Due to its gigantic size, it can carry the whole island of Zou on its back, and as a result of its seemingly incredible endurance has been able to spend an entire millennium continuously carrying Zou whilst walking. Zunesha can suck up and expel massive amounts of sea water, and with it lots of fish, using its trunk. With a single swing of its trunk, it can wipe out entire fleets of ships and swiftly defeated Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates. Zunesha has extraordinary eyesight and can see faraway objects in great detail. However, due to having lived for so long, it is not very durable, so its weak and aged skin can be heavily damaged by concentrated cannon fire. Zunesha has the \"Voice of All Things\", allowing it to telepathically communicate with others with the same ability."},

He wears a light colored sash and shoes, and is seen carrying two swords. His black shoes are also decorated with white tulips.", "personality": "Yurikah is a vicious and evil pirate, since he took a woman hostage so Fullbody would stop fighting back against his crew.

Her real name was revealed in Vivre Card.", "appearance": "Zala is a tall, slim young woman with curly dark-blue hair, thick lips, dark green eyes, pale skin and a curvaceous figure. Her most striking feature is probably the over-exaggerated way she walks, describing hip swings that are often used to display a sexy woman. Outside of Baroque Works, when first introduced in the Spiders Cafe, Zala is shown donning yellow crystal square glasses and a diamond-patterned bandanna that combines a variety of pink, turquoise, white and purple tones. She is also shown wearing a tank-top; purple in color, with pink embroideries drawn across it and green ornaments that resemble some kind of bushes representations. She wears dark brown low-riding pants, platform sandals, and has her long, dark blue hair tied back in a ponytail. Later on, Zala is seen donning her most characteristic outfit; revealing and dark brown in color, this outfit mainly consists of a short long-sleeved jacket with beige colored fur brims, a bikini top describing an unusual spider web-like pattern across her abdominal area, low-riding pants, and platform sandals. She is sometimes seen smoking from a long whitish pipe. During Miss Goldenweek's \"Operation: Meet Baroque Works\", Zala wore the typical striped prisoner outfit, which covered from the upper part of her torso to her thighs, dark footwear and large handcuffs.", "personality": "Zala is Mr. 1's calm and mild tempered partner who has a funny way of walking, over-exaggerating the \"sexy\" hip swing. She is not easily amused by the antics of others and remains unweathered in any situation. She also displays a tendency to play with her victims; during her fight with Nami she took her time in dealing with her, only really going after her when she finally lost her patience at Nami's apparently \"useless\" weapon. She is nonetheless a lethal fighter who does not shy away from violence, much like her partner Mr. 1. She has, however, shown small hints of mercy, as she told Nami that she would kill her as painlessly as possible if she surrendered. She also stated several times during the battle that she feels bad for Nami, because she was stuck with a weapon that appeared to have no use, but it didn't stop her from going after Nami. Zala is also shown to be brave, compared to the rest of herformer colleagues. For example,despite the fact that any potential risk for her safety could have been provoked,she decided to directly ask Crocodile about his objective after the latter had revealed his public identity while Mr. 1, Mr. 2, Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmasremained intimidated by their boss' presence.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zala is shown to be a fairly skilled fighter even though she mostly relies on the advantages provided by her Devil Fruit. She is shown to be somewhat ruthless and certainly feels no sympathy towards her victims; although she is less serious than her partner, going so far as to display amused confidence in her fights. Her skills are, however, great enough to bepartneredwith Mr. 1, granting her the second highest ranking female officer agent title inBaroque Works, being bested only byMiss All-Sunday. Zala ate the Toge Toge no Mi, aParamecia-typeDevil Fruitthat grants her the ability to grow strong, pointy spikes from any part of her body. Zala mainly makes use of her Devil Fruit power in order to stab her opponents. She is able to \"dope\" herself, which increases her muscle mass and strength to the point that she is able to demolish a whole building with a single movement. She is occasionally seen making use of her power in order to obtain enhanced speed as well bysprouting spikes from the bottom of her feet, granting her major velocity. It is notable how greatly versatile her Devil Fruit is: showing balance between offense and defense, especially at close range,since struggling against the sharp spikes she produces will usually result in severe injuries and damage to her opponent."},

He was first identified in Chapter 845.", "appearance": "Zeus normally appears as a large and light-colored cloud. When he caused a storm, he becomes dark and produces yellow lightning crackles (pink in the anime while controlled by Big Mom, yellow in the anime while controlled by Nami). He also wears a striped red and blue (red and white in the anime) baseball cap with a yellow brim on his head. He usually has a carefree, sleepy expression, but can take on a more sinister appearance. When he was initially described by Pound, he lacked the baseball cap and most of his facial features. After being sliced in half by Brook and then drained of electricity by Nami, Zeus's size was greatly reduced, enough to be held in one hand, and his face was enough to cover much of his body. During the raid on Onigashima, Zeus wore a blue kabuto helmet when he appeared alongside the other Straw Hats. After fusing with Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus's face can also appear in the middle of the Sorcery Clima-Tact's hilt, maintaining a dopey expression with blush marks. His face can also be transferred to the orange appendages at the end of the Clima-Tact whenever he causes them to grow, and he can also transfer his consciousness to the weather phenomena created by the Clima-Tact. However, he mainly continues to assume his cloud form.", "personality": "As one of her personal weapons, Zeus was very loyal to Big Mom and would come to her when she summoned him. Zeus also seemed to care about the safety of the citizens in Totto Land and hated to see them be tormented during Big Mom's rampages, but unlike his fellow homies, Zeus knew it was futile to try and reason with Big Mom when she is on one of her rampages. However, despite his loyalty, Zeus shares her extreme gluttony and particularly enjoys eating thunderclouds. Zeus was willing to disobey direct orders from Big Mom as long as Nami kept feeding him thunderclouds. However, he is capable of reason and learning from his mistakes, as he became very angry when Nami tried feeding him again, though his anger made him open to attack. His loyalty to Big Mom does not come before valuing his own life, as when Big Mom ordered Hera to consume him, he begged to be allowed to leave in peace rather than surrender his soul power to Hera. He went as far as to assist Nami after feeling betrayed by Big Mom, and was willing to attack his master as a means of apology towards Nami for his earlier betrayal. He is also extremely carefree, as after he became Nami's servant, he readily accepted it and found it comfortable to be stored inside her Clima-Tact.", "abilities_and_powers": "Zeus is far more powerful than normal homies, being made from a fragment of Big Mom's very own soul. This gives the cloud a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the Yomi Yomi no Mi's user. However, he can still be harmed by the user's attacks, as shown when Brook unleashed a powerful attack that sliced him in half, though Zeus was able to survive due to his composition. As a cloud, Zeus can fly, produce both normal and \"sweet rain\" (, Mizuame?), and attack with powerful bolts of lightning, strong enough to defeat Vinsmoke Judge in one hit. When combining powers with Prometheus, they can manipulate the weather to create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms. Like Prometheus, Zeus is mostly immune to physical attacks due to being an intangible cloud, even attacks imbued with Busoshoku Haki, being simply able to recombine his body. However, unleashing massive discharges weakens Zeus, decreasing his size until he can recharge by consuming electricity. It has also been shown that electricity-based attacks work well against Zeus due to his composition as a thundercloud; if someone unleashes electrical energy that combines with his, Zeus can be forced to unwillingly discharge his electricity, up to the point of harming his master Big Mom. Zeus' attacks being lightning-based also means certain characters can resist them without much issue, such as Monkey D. Luffy, whose body is made of insulating rubber, and Brook, who has no flesh to be harmed by electricity to begin with. He can also expand and serve as a seat for Big Mom, being made of more dense and tangible material similar to Sea Clouds. Zeus can also carry objects and people while flying, as seen when he transported Pudding and Sanji to the wedding venue and when he carried Big Mom to chase the Straw Hats, flying at incredible speeds, enough to catch up to the Straw Hats, who had a significant headstart, while carrying Big Mom. After his soul was transferred to Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus gained a wider breadth of abilities. He can manipulate the orange appendages on both ends and shape them as he pleases, having shown the ability to freely form it into weapons like a mace. This makes it similar to Napoleon's ability in manipulating the weapon's shape they inhabit. He can also inhabit weather phenomena that Nami generates from the Clima-Tact, allowing him to perform lightning-based attacks like he is used to if Nami generates a cloud using him. Although Zeus claims that his soul cannot leave the Clima-Tact without Big Mom's ability, he is seemingly able to exist in cloud form without being tethered to it. It is unclear whether he is limited to a certain range."},

After the timeskip, Yosaku is no longer wearing the coat and is seen shirtless, showing he has a kanji tattoo that reads \"Big Catch\" (, Tairy?) on his back. His arms have become very muscular.", "personality": "When he is with Johnny, the pair often stand together side by side, with one arm across the chest and the other at their mouths. While like this, their voices and behavior become serious, however in truth, they are very silly and emotional. Yosaku is the more emotional of the pair and he can spend hours crying over stories of difficult times and struggles. He tends to get frustrated and even upset when no one pays attention to him when talking. Like Johnny, he has a fair amount of knowledge regarding rumors and the world but lacks the finer details. He was partly blamed by Zoro for their misinformation over \"Hawk-Eyes\" and \"Drunk-Eyes\". He prefers to avoid danger like Johnny, but unlike Johnny, he quickly forgets his fears if distracted by something else like food or by being moved by a story linked to the fear. When he is spurred on, he is brave enough to go against Arlong and his crew and wise enough to know that if they did not stand a chance against Arlong and his crew the villagers they made suffer would be slaughtered. One quirk he shares with Johnny, perhaps out of pride, is always stating that any fight he loses, he lost only by a hair.", "abilities_and_powers": "Yosaku is a swordsman like Johnny, however they are relatively low in strength and power. As for example when they tried to take on the Arlong Pirates by themselves they were easily overpowered. He and Johnny are inexperienced with traveling by sea as proven when Yosaku fell ill to scurvy. However, he and Johnny are fairly knowledgeable about the world at large, such as information on the existence of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Arlong Pirates; he even identified Momoo as a Grand Line monster upon first glance when the Sea Cow confronted the boat that he, Luffy and Sanji were on, hinting some degree of experience. They are, however, still incompetent and have been known to slip up, as when they reported Hawk-Eyes had been reported at the Baratie when it was actually \"Drunk-Eyes\". Yosaku wields one of the two Nakiri Swords. It is a sword, that resembles a dadao, with a red handle and a circular tsuba. The blade of the sword gets broader as it gets farther away from the hilt. He does not appear to own a sheath for it, as it is shown being hung on his waist with a piece of looped cloth rather than a sheath."},

She seems to have a vapid personality with her head in the clouds, rarely speaking except for yawning or remarking about sleeping or eating, but wantonly approached a dangerous Seraphim because she found it cute. However, this was later shown to be a faade. In truth, York is a highly selfish schemer who possesses lofty ambitions, willing to betray her fellow Vegapunks solely for the chance to become a World Noble. She believes that only one Vegapunk is necessary in the world and is not against eliminating her peers if needed, betraying the Satellites' purpose of ensuring Stella's safety even at the cost of their lives. York also shows no signs of mercy or remorse should casualties arise due to her actions, as she was willing to accept all of them should it serve her ultimate goal. When defeated, York is shown to be quite cowardly, spiteful and insensitive.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a satellite of Vegapunk, York has likely been a contributor to the genius scientists numerous technological developments. She is responsible for eating, sleeping and defecating on behalf of all the other satellites. As such, she consumes large quantities of food to the degree of attaining a BMI of 600 (20 times the amount considered obese), expels the waste, and sleeps for their sakes, doing so multiple times per day, but this does not seem to negatively affect her body. In spite of her rather passive role as a scientist, York is very cunning, deceptive, manipulative and skilled at keeping a low profile, having orchestrated most of the incidents that have happened during the Egghead Arc without ever arousing suspicion of herself or being detected by either Vegapunk or the other satellites. This includes prior, arc-leading events such as contacting the Five Elders about Vegapunk's history research or kidnapping several Cipher Pol agents multiple times, occurrences even Vegapunk admitted he was completely unaware of. York is capable of replicating the Mother Flame, which makes her valuable to the World Government. York is also a skilled gunwoman, having shot Shaka in the head with a simple, ordinary pistol (albeit a very large one, befitting her size) and from a considerable range."},

His name was revealed by Kaidou in Chapter 979.", "appearance": "Being assigned female at birth and not usually choosing to explicitly present as male, Yamato has typically been referred to as a woman by people when they first encounter him. Yamato is taller than an average human, standing at 263 cm (8'8\"). He has long, white hair that is bound between orange rods into a ponytail at the back, which fades into aqua green and then blue the further down it goes, and ends in rectangular locks similar to Kaidou. Yamato also has large, orange eyes with prominent eyelashes, wears gold hoop earrings on both ears, and has horns on the top of his head which are mostly red, but gradually become more flesh-colored toward the base. Yamato's current outfit is a sleeveless white garment with a diamond-shaped design on both sides and an indigo, wisp-patterned bottom half. He wears a pair of red hakama pants and sandals, and, much like Oden, wears a large purple and white nio-dasuki behind his back. While in disguise, Yamato originally also wore a hannya mask, which has a blue wig with an extremely long and wild mane attached to the top and a long blue goatee attached to the bottom. The kimono initially had long white sleeves, but were ripped off along with the rest of the disguise making Yamato's kimono more form-fitting. Four years ago, Yamato wore a similar long-sleeved outfit, but with different symbols near the breasts. The symbols resemble an oden skewer. At age 8, Yamato's outfit was nearly identical to today, except with a slightly different mask with shorter horns and beard and without the nio-dasuki. In the manga this outfit lacked the diamond-shaped design.", "personality": "Yamato greatly admires the legendary samurai Kozuki Oden to the point of even proclaiming to carry his identity. Yamato has self-identified as Oden on multiple occasions and has even emulated his gender, proclaiming to be the son of Kaidou due to Oden being a man. Although initially carrying doubts as to how to present as Oden, Yamato has steadily expressed a straightforward attitude regarding this identity as time has gone on, even proclaiming this as such to Oden's son Momonosuke, to the boy's horror. Although having wholeheartedly embraced this identity, Yamato retains his original persona, referring to Yamato as his \"other name\". Yamato does not seem to like being misnamed, having quickly corrected Luffy when given a nickname. Having read of the great exploits documented by Oden in his logbook, which he considers his \"bible\", Yamato dreams of leaving Wano Country's confines and setting out to sea with the Straw Hat Pirates, much like Oden did with the Whitebeard and Roger Pirates decades before. Yamato also wishes to fulfill the goals that Oden had, namely opening Wano's borders, in direct defiance to Kaidou's wishes for the country. Yamato has shown to be extremely strong-willed, having put up considerable resistance to Kaidou's imprisonment despite taking decades to finally break free. Although initially seeming to be more subordinate to him previously, Yamato's battle with Ace led to him destroying Kaidou's dragon statue in an act of defiance that has since led to more outright rebellion. Yamato has engaged in combat with Kaidou numerous times and has openly expressed opposition and defiance to his plans concerning the two of them, accompanied by insults. When the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance invaded Onigashima, Yamato was immediately willing to help them and had no qualms with attacking members of his father's crew, making his intentions and loyalty clear to them in the process. Yamato is also willing to go to great lengths to achieve his objectives, having basically kidnapped Luffy in order to get to talk to him and following through with this tactic even after Luffy responded by fighting back. Yamato is more than willing to put his body and life on the line to protect people out of care, believing that Oden would never abandon a comrade in danger. Yamato resolutely withstood a barrage of powerful artillery strikes by the Armored Division to protect Momonosuke, and later confronted Kaidou alone to stall him until Luffy returned despite knowing he was no match for his father. However, Yamato also takes enjoyment in engaging in combat; despite framing his plan to split up from Momonosuke as a decoy strategy to trick the Beasts Pirates, Momonosuke and Shinobu both noted to themselves that he seemed mainly interested in going to fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Yamato is an extremely powerful warrior, with Black Maria noting that bringing him back to Kaidou's fortress after he had escaped would be a difficult task. In the past, Yamato was able to clash against Ace, a powerful Logia user, on equal ground. Afterwards, Ace acknowledged Yamato's abilities, saying he could not believe someone so strong was not the captain and lamenting that he could not join his crew. During the raid on Onigashima, Yamato clashed with Kaidou, a particularly notable feat considering the Emperor's nearly unparalleled physical might, with Kaidou himself acknowledging his son's strength and value as a soldier. Luffy also greatly respects Yamato's abilities, trusting him with protecting Wano after it became vulnerable to outside forces following Kaidou's defeat, despite wishing for Yamato to join his pirate crew. Yamato possesses immense physical strength resembling that of Kaidou, being capable of wielding a large and heavy kanabo and using it to knock out Ulti, an Ancient Zoan user and one of the Tobiroppo, with just one blow. Yamato was also able to physically match Luffy's strength with relative ease, even when he increased his strength exponentially with Gear 2 and Gear 3. When he countered a punch from Luffy with a kick, the powerful collision destroyed part of the nearby wall and ceiling and blew back the Beasts Pirates around them. Yamato could easily run while carrying Luffy with just one arm and was able to shatter the extremely tough armor and weaponry of the Beasts Pirates' Armored Corps. Yamato is extremely fast, being able to lunge forward with blinding speed to attack, as well as outrun members of the Beasts Pirates in pursuit, and eventually completely elude the pirates and escape to the attic with Luffy without anyone seeing them. Yamato possesses tremendous levels of durability and endurance, having emerged from being struck by multiple explosive bazooka blasts with only superficial bruises and cuts, though eventually began taking more serious wounds as the bazooka strikes continued. During the fight against Kaidou, Yamato was able to withstand the Emperor's powerful attacks and continue to fight effectively. Yamato ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Okuchi no Makami, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a divine wolf, as well as a human-divine wolf hybrid. According to Kaidou, this beast is a \"Guardian Deity of Wano Country\". Yamato ate this fruit purely out of hunger, with Kaidou not intending for him to be the one consuming the fruit. As a Zoan, this fruit greatly bolsters Yamato's physical abilities. He was able to clash near-evenly against Kaidou, an Emperor of the Sea, while the latter had assumed his extremely powerful human-dragon form. Furthermore, being a carnivorous animal, this animal transformation grants Yamato heightened predatory instincts, as well as equipping fangs and claws that are well-suited for combat. Being a Mythical Zoan, this fruit bestows special powers that a regular wolf does not possess. Yamato is able to generate ice, using it for augmenting weapons, creating protection with ice armor or walls, and even releasing a powerful blast of ice from his breath that can clash evenly with and cancel out Kaidou's flame breath blast. Yamato is one of very few people in the world who is capable of using all three types of Haki. Yamato is an immensely skilled user of Haoshoku Haki, a very rare form of Haki whose users are said to have the qualities of a \"king\". It was first awakened 20 years ago as a result of Yamato running wild throughout Onigashima as a child, knocking out Kaidou's subordinates. As an adult, Yamato demonstrated its advanced application of \"infusion\", something that only a \"handful\" of people can do, often imbuing his weapon Takeru causing a stream of black lightning to be emitted from it, as shown when performing Raimei Hakke and Shinsoku Hakujaku. Yamato is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, as shown by facing off against Ace, a Logia user and clashing against his flames, managing to wound him. Two years later, Yamato was shown projecting a long-distance swing using a hardened Takeru that knocked out Hatcha. Yamato's Busoshoku Haki is strong enough to wound Kaidou whose skin is impervious to all but the strongest Haki attacks. Yamato is a very skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, which allowed him to sense a burst of Shanks' Haoshoku Haki. Yamato wields a giant kanabo club named Takeru, which is much like Kaidou's club Hassaikai, though it is studded and more slender while Hassaikai is spiked and a bit thicker. Coupled with Yamato's immense strength, the kanabo can cause tremendous damage to objects and opponents with a single hit, and with Yamato's strength and Haki, it can be used to perform flying strikes that can even resemble energy blasts. Yamato has masterful technique with his kanabo despite its great size and weight, being capable of moving it to counter Luffy's rapid attacks with little effort."},

She is an experienced veteran, having started as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates during their early years before becoming a captain of her own pirate crew. In the anime, she is seen wielding a sword. Whitey Bay's pirate ship is an icebreaker (, saihysen?). Whitey's icebreaker has a steel-plated hull instead of a wooden hull seen on most other ships in the series so far. Also in place of a figurehead, the ship has a snowflake insignia on the front. On board the ship is the cabin which also has snowflakes painted on the walls, and has cannons mounted on top. There are masts and sails, with the front sail having the crew's Jolly Roger painted on it. Because of the ship's steel-plated hull, it boasts higher offensive and defensive capabilities. Its main purpose is to break through ice-covered waters, including the sea of ice created by Admiral Aokiji. This made her ship the only one of the entire Whitebeard Pirates capable of continuing onward, while the rest were trapped by the ice. Additionally, her ship broke through a section of Marineford's wall."},

He has droopy eyes, regardless of his expression.", "personality": "Wire is taciturn and usually, he does not show any type of emotion, as he is often seen standing in the background with a mopish expression in his face.

He is sympathetic to Killer for what happened to him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wire is strong enough to withstand the blast of Haki that Silvers Rayleigh used at the Human Auctioning House on Sabaody Archipelago. During their fight against the Marines in the Sabaody Archipelago, he was shown kicking his opponents, similar to Sanji and Bepo. Wire's weapon of choice is a dark red trident."},

{"name": "Woop Slap", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 4", "year": 1997, "note": "His name was revealed in the Blue databook.", "appearance": "Woop Slap is a short, wiry, bespectacled man with something of a cleft chin. He generally wears lightweight \"tropical\" clothing, along with a selection of striped hats. As a younger man, he once wore his facial hair as stubble, but has since grown them into a full mustache and goatee. His age has also caused him to take up a walking cane.", "personality": "For the most part, Woop Slap is a typical village elder: practical, humorless, and disdainful of pirates (with the semi-exception of Shanks). As such, he is Foosha Village's loudestif not onlycritic against Luffy's dreams of piracy, and has remained so long after Luffy's crew attained worldwide notoriety. At the same time, he cares deeply for his village, and is willing to go to great lengths for its people, Luffy included. Such is his dedication that, despite his irascible personality, he has managed to remain mayor for more than a decade."},
{"name": "X Drake", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Drake is a tall, lean, and muscular man who wears what appears to be a combination of a white-plumed cocked hat with his crew's Jolly Roger on the side and a domino mask over his eyes. Underneath this headgear, Drake's hair is reddish brown, with brush-like sideburns. On his broad chin he has an \"X\" (not confirmed to be either a scar or tattoo) and on his chest and upper body he also has another large \"X\". The \"X's\", as well as that in his name, represents the Roman Numeral X for 10, not the English letter. When seen from above, his bicorne greatly resembles the head of a Pterodactyl. He wears armor on his relatively thin legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows, respectively. The openings to both the gloves and the boots are also secured by the armor, which is rounded for the gloves and a sharp maple leaf pattern for the boots at the front of his knees. On the rest of his body, he wears leather pants and a leather shirt. A belt with a large ornately designed circular belt buckle secures Drake's pants as well as his sword and axe to his waist. He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a white fur lining around the neck. After the Summit War, he is seen wearing a scarf that is tied around his neck when he appeared on a winter island that was apparently under the protection of Kaidou. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Drake is shown wearing a small tattered Marine uniform, showing that he aspired to become a Marine since he was very young. He had a rounder face, shorter hair, and a wooden sword at his side. He did not have the \"X\" on his chin yet. He appears to have been a playful and cheerful boy, as opposed to the stern and serious man he grew up to be. As a young adult, Drake wore a tattered, bloodied shirt with pants and boots on the snowy Minion Island while with the Barrels Pirates, though later on during a supposed escape, he managed to acquire a somewhat tattered, thick winter coat with a hood as well as a pair of dark gloves. Due to the mental and physical abuse he suffered from his father, he was undersized for his age and easily mistaken as a child by the Donquixote Pirates. After the timeskip, Drake no longer has his bicorne, exposing his now light orange hair spiked into a fauxhawk. In place of his bicorne, he now has a black headband with an eyehole cut out of it and his crew's Jolly Roger next to the hole. The headband is slanted so it goes over his left eye, and a thin piece of cloth from it, presumably cut from the hole, is fitted over his right eye.", "personality": "In his childhood, Drake was a Marine enthusiast and deeply admired his father, Diez Barrels, who served the organization as an officer. When Barrels turned to piracy, Drake still thought of his father as a good man and kept following him. As a young man thirteen years ago, Drake appeared to be the reluctant, submissive type, obeying his father despite the abusive treatment he was given. Barrels once stated that despite his strength, Drake was a coward and rarely contributed to his crew's operations. Indeed, by that point, Drake ran away when the opportunity presented itself, displaying no loyalty to his family. In the present, Drake seemingly has not regretted this decision, holding no grudge towards the perpetrators of his father's death. In spite of the horrible treatment his father gave him, Drake still remains loyal to the Marines, putting his life at risk in order to infiltrate the crew of one of the Four Emperors. Even when presented with the threat of torture, Drake stated that he would rather die than reveal his true allegiance, only deciding to keep fighting because he still had a mission to accomplish. Drake is flexible with his beliefs of Justice as he is not picky about potential allies in criminals and outlaws, going as far as request to join forces with Monkey D. Luffy, an enemy of the World Government, just because of the Straw Hat's friendship with Koby, Drake's subordinate. A honorable man, Drake has declared that he intends to repay Luffy for accepting him as an ally in a time of need. Currently, Drake displays a stern, dead-serious disposition at all times. Patient and observant, he appears to be a pirate who avoids needless violence, aware that such a thing would attract unwanted attention. In fact, he may even intervene in fights where he is not involved at all, doing so in the middle of confrontation between Killer and Urouge in an attempt to pacify both of his fellow Super Rookies. However, when a situation calls for violence, Drake reveals a surprisingly ruthless and bloodthirsty streak. Trafalgar Law once implied that Drake had killed a significant amount of people in his career, reinforcing the notion that the former rear admiral is actually not opposed to conflict at all. Later, Drake fearlessly attacked a Pacifista head-on, employing a brutal biting attack in his Zoan form. Drake is bold enough to even challenge a subordinate of the Four Emperors, knowing full well that such an action would put him in the crosshairs of the Emperor himself. As one of the Tobiroppo, Drake is very much mission-oriented, always prioritizing the job assigned to him, although he might think his presence in certain tasks may be overkill, like assassinating the owner of a small noodle shop. This professionalism and dutifulness also extend to his job as a Marine spy, reporting everything of note that he ends up witnessing in his cover. Despite holding a high position in the Beasts Pirates, Drake self-admittedly has no interest in raising further in the ranks, unlike some of his fellow Tobiroppo. In spite of his generally serious attitude, Drake is known to sometimes lose his composure in certain situations. In particular, naked women easily fluster him to the point of fainting at the sight of one, making him wary of entering places like bathhouses. Nevertheless, he still denies this weakness even if it's obviously the case.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Marine Headquarters' secret special force, SWORD and the Drake Pirates, Drake has great authority over his subordinates. Even during his youth, he was the strongest member of the Barrels Pirates, and he later achieved the rank of Rear Admiral in the Marines, prior to his public defection. He is a member of the Worst Generation that survived one of the seven harsh and dangerous routes through Paradise, the first half of the Grand Line, earning a bounty of 220,000,000 before entering the New World. Despite his attack on a favorite island of the Emperor Kaidou, Drake survived the experience and made a greater name for himself. At some point during the two-year timeskip, he became one of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, holding a high position in the crew with authority over the lower-ranking members, before his treason was exposed and he left the crew. Drake is an extremely formidable combatant; he stopped a fight between two other Supernovas with just one move, effortlessly defeated a Super Rookie, and was one of the few pirates on the Sabaody Archipelago capable of injuring a Pacifista without outside help. According to Kozuki Sukiyaki, Drake single-handedly defeated the five samurai who guarded Amigasa Village, and destroyed the town. During the raid on Onigashima, Drake defeated the drunken ancient giant, Juki, with a single attack, and despite having lost his battle against CP0, his sheer toughness was still praised by Guernica. While a powerful person in his own right, he has a surprising weakness in that he becomes faint at the sight of a naked female. Drake has immense strength; he blocked simultaneous blows from Urouge and Killer, fellow members of the Worst Generation, with little effort, and knocked a Pacifista into a building with a mere two hits. He has vast reserves of stamina and a great tolerance for pain, as he exhibited little discomfort after having a laser pierce through his abdomen, remained conscious (though heavily wounded) after being kicked by Kizaru into a building at the speed of light, and he quickly recovered after being defeated by CPO, retaining enough strength to impale an agent with his sword. Drake also managed to survived being stab in the neck for some time. Additionally, Drake is quite intelligent, interrupting Killer and Urouge's battle because he knew that it would only draw more unwanted attention, and possesses a deep understanding of the workings of the World Government, being aware of the Pacifista and Vegapunk. He successfully went undercover as a pirate captain and founded his own crew for an unknown purpose. After he left the Beasts Pirates, Drake quickly took advantage of his what he had previously heard about Luffy from Koby in order to convince him that he was on his side. Drake dual wields both a rapier and a four-bladed axe and is extremely skilled in wielding them simultaneously. Drake ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Allosaurus, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full allosaurus and a human-allosaurus hybrid at will. As a carnivorous Zoan, Drake gains a significant enhancement to his physical abilities in close combat. He also gains advantageous bodily characteristics, including extremely hard and sharp teeth and powerful jaws that are strong enough to bite through the stronger-than-steel body of a Pacifista, causing it to bleed. His great reptilian tail is also a powerful weapon, capable of slamming people with great force. He also gains sharp claws on his feet, augmenting his kicks. Drake has shown that he is capable of using Busoshoku Haki when he easily defeated Caribou, a Logia user. He is also capable of imbuing his weapons with Busoshoku Haki to augment the power of his attacks. Drake possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Wyper", "episode": "Episode 237", "chapter": "Chapter 153", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 249.", "appearance": "Wyper is a tall, muscular Shandia, and as such, sports a pair of little wings on his back. He's covered by various tribal tattoos across his left shoulder and the left side of his face. He has very long dark brown hair is arranged in a mohawk that follows into a segmented braid that goes slightly past his waist, resembling those worn by real life Native Americans, and he has little spherical earrings. Wyper always goes shirtless, and is also shoeless beyond using Skate-type Wavers in battle. He generally wears a grass skirt, with a rope belt decorated by three small ornaments that look like fangs or claws around his waist. He is usually seen smoking a cigarillo, chomping down on it during battle, and as a child he chewed on a grass stalk before he moved up to tobacco, showing it is a definite habit of his. He also wore an intimidating tribal mask in his first appearance, but soon discarded it. After the timeskip he now wears his hair unbraided, appearing to have a full head of long hair past his shoulders. He also has the coat his fellow guards wear tied around his waist instead of actually wearing it.He also has a more muscular build. In the anime, Wyper's tattoos are intricately colored with green and red. However, in the manga and other related media, his tattoos are colored black.", "personality": "Inheriting the violent tendencies of his ancestor, Wyper is first shown to be an extremely violent and irrational man. He believes to follow the path of his ancestor and his principles. He does not easily trust outsiders and is quick to fight anyone without a second thought. Because of this, he is called a berserker. Despite this however, Wyper has a deep love for his people and his homeland. He also has a deep respect for his ancestor's best friend, Mont Blanc Noland, to whom he feels obligated to because of Noland's deeds, friendship to Kalgara, and unfortunate fate. In fact, it is Wyper's love for his people and his obligation to Noland that drives him. It is because of these that Wyper has taken responsibility to restore his people's home and put an ease to Noland's soul. While he means well, his determination sometimes tends to blind him thus causing Wyper to become more violent and push himself beyond his physical limits. He is, however, not completely heartless towards others. He realized Luffy's goal, although different, was alike to his own and is moved by his efforts. Both because of Luffy's actions during the battle with Enel and the need for fighting having been removed, Wyper seems to have now calmed down.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wyper is a notably powerful opponent and acted as the leader of the Shandia warriors tasked with fighting to take Upper Yard back from Enel, showcasing his skills as the Shandia tribe's strongest warrior at the time. He is quite skilled at close combat, mainly involving the use of Skate-type Wavers to boost his kicks and to swiftly attack his opponent before blasting them with his Burn Bazooka. Wyper has superhuman endurance as he is able to use his Reject Dial three times without dying, a feat that normally kills a regular person with one try. Also, he was able to take a blast by an Axe Dial in the back and only take minor damage. He was also able to withstand having his arm ignited and burned by Shura's spear with no effort, even shrugging off the injury. He was also able to survive taking multiple direct attacks from Enel himself, and counterattack with a Reject Dial despite his injuries. It is possible that Wyper partially inherited his physical prowess from Kalgara. He was able to physically fight on par with Luffy and withstand his attacks when they crossed paths on Upper Yard, as well as match Zoro during the Ordeal of Iron. Wyper generally fights using a Burn Bazooka. His Burn Bazooka is a typical bazooka capable of firing cannonballs and such. However, when equipped with a Breath Dial, the bazooka is able to fire a large blast of white-blue flames caused by the ignition of the bazooka and the gas released from the Dial within. He also has a large ballistic shield to protect himself from attacks. For Enel's Survival Game, Wyper equipped himself with a Reject Dial. The Dial is ten times stronger than a regular Impact Dial and is able to inflict great damage. The damage released by the dial however, is both devastating to the opponent it is being used against and the person using it. A regular person would be killed with one try. As such, Wyper used the Dial sparingly knowing the risks involved. For the game, Wyper also equipped his Shooters with Seastone so he could go against Devil Fruit users such as Enel and Luffy."},
{"name": "Who's-Who", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "His name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978. He appeared shadowed in the anime in Episode 954.", "appearance": "Who's-Who is a very tall man at over 3.3 meters, lean yet well-toned with particularly long legs and a light complexion. A mane of wavy, pink-colored hair goes down his back a little past his waist, and a pair of long, upward-curving horns jut out of his head. A chain smoker, Who's-Who is always seen with a cigarette in his mouth. Like some of his subordinates, Who's-Who wears a mask over the top half of his head down over his nose, which comes centrally to a slightly raised edge and point. It is red in color and bears two horns (fitting over his natural horns) that are connected to the mask's sides by a circular base each. While Who's-Who's lower face remains bare, including his full-lipped mouth and square jaw, his ears are half-covered, with a golden hoop earring still visible on each, and his eyes obscured by large, yellow, circular coverings that do not seem to obstruct the man's vision. For his upper body, Who's-Who dons a plain, button-cuffed jacket colored the same red as the mask (paired with black gloves) over a black shirt with a double-winged collar, both unbuttoned to show off his chest and abdominals. The former is tattooed with two swirl-ended lines topping a stylized, thick-lashed eye motif, with his name below spelled \"WHO S WHO\", all in black color (dark-purple in the anime, with the S bolded). His lower wear consists of matching red, slim-fit pants held up by a wide, purple belt with a big, round, stud-lined gold buckle (bearing a yellow pinwheel shape in the middle), and lastly black dress shoes with single latchets buckled on each side. As a young child seen busy with martial arts training, Who's-Who wore simple dark pants with a flowing, light-colored sash and dark slip-ons, otherwise going shirtless; the upper half of his face was obscured by his wild hair in place of a mask. As an adult while a CP9 agent, 13 years ago, Who's-Who took to wearing a simple dark suit paired with a dark dress shirt, plus a tie of contrastively light color; like in his childhood, he wore his hair at neck length, his long bangs still hiding his eyes.", "personality": "Who's-Who tends to maintain a calm and serious disposition while around peers, like showing annoyance at their bickering. Somewhat ironically though, he has also shown himself to be loquacious at times, such as rambling on about his past while in the middle of a fight. An ambitious man, Who's-Who strives to become one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars by taking a spot from one of the current three, leading him to completely disregard their senior authority; this desire, according to King, stems from Who's-Who's past as captain of his own crew. In accordance, he has shown himself to be confident in his strength, believing it enough for him to kill an All-Star and smirking excitedly at the thought of gaining an opportunity to try. Further evidencing his self-confidence is Who's-Who's claim of having had the same potential as Rob Lucci, the strongest-ever CP9 agent. In battle, Who's-Who tends to be derisive toward enemies, openly laughing at their or their allies' predicaments. He also feels no need to honor the spirit of a fair fight, as he freely chose to gang up on Jinbe with his subordinates all the while mocking his foe about that very situation. What is more, Who's-Who has shown himself to be casually racist and ignorant of the history of other kinds of people, having remarked that Jinbe was fast \"for a fish-man\" fighting on land and also heavily correlating the fish-men race with slavery, with both remarks drawing ire from Jinbe. Due to his painful past, Who's-Who has grown spiteful toward anyone who reminds him of it, including the Straw Hat Pirates and, especially, Luffy due to the latter's indirect connection to said past. Amid his imprisonment starting over a decade ago, Who's-Who gained a vested interest in the legend of the so-called \"Sun God\" Nika, which a certain prison guard had told him about. Just like slaves of the long-distant past supposedly believed in said Sun God as a savior figure who would free and deliver them from suffering, Who's-Who himself became attached to the legend, due to his misery in jail and a wish for someone to save him. Even in the present time as a free man, Who's-Who remains interested in the myth, bluntly asking his enemy, Jinbe, in the midst of combat whether he knew of anything relating to Nika, on the flimsy assumption that he may do so because of fish-men's history with slavery and the Sun Pirates' symbol of the sun.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Who's-Who holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, only Kaidou himself and the All-Stars ranking above him. An ex-pirate captain, Who's-Who also commanded his own crew, the Who's-Who Pirates, before joining Kaidou. Before that, he had been a noteworthy member of the World Government's CP9 agency, implying a certain level of authority he must have held in it before his imprisonment. In combat, Who's-Who is very formidable, being one of the strongest members of an Emperor-led crew and potentially able to challenge the All-Stars for their positionsomething Who's-Who appeared confident in his ability to do. Among the Tobiroppo, he also has the highest bounty at 546,000,000, attesting to his power. Twelve years ago, before committing to piracy, Who's-Who was powerful enough to be considered, by his own word, a bright prospect among CP9 with the same potential as the genius Rob Lucci, who would grow to be the agency's most renowned superhuman assassin. In the present, Who's-Who has proven himself capable of holding his own in a fight against the ex-Warlord of the Sea, Jinbe, impressing the latter with his skill. He even gained the upper hand against the fish-man for a brief period, through a relentless barrage of attacks, though Jinbe in turn began overwhelming the Tobiroppo member shortly after and went on to defeat him with a single decisive blow. Who's-Who can also be rather strategic, leading his then-fellow Tobiroppo Drake into an ambush by using his own supposed feud with Queen as a pretext to convince the SWORD captain into following him. Who's-Who possesses tremendous levels of strength, speed, and durability which are elevated by his mastery of Rokushiki. He was capable of going toe-to-toe against Jinbe, one of the strongest known fish-men, and matched his foe's strength for some time, though he was eventually overpowered. As a renegade CP9 agent said to have talent on par with Rob Lucci's, Who's-Who is a powerful Rokushiki master capable of using all six styles. He has exhibited skill with using the basic techniqueslike Soru, Geppo, Tekkai, and Rankyakualongside more advanced, self-developed variants, like three Shigan derivatives that employ the use of his dagger as well as the fangs and claws gained from his Zoan transformation. Who's-Who ate the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Saber Tiger, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a saber-toothed tiger (Smilodon) and a hybrid between a human and said animal. Who's-Who is notably large in his full Beast Form, dwarfing normal humans. His muscular Human-Beast Form greatly bolsters his physical strength and combat ability, typical of a carnivorous Ancient Zoan type. His saber-toothed tiger attributes also vastly enhance the versatility of his Rokushiki, e.g., letting him utilize his fangs to shoot maw-shaped, \"biting\" shockwaves that rip through anything they hit and which ordinary Busoshoku Haki cannot block, or using his clawed fingers for a stronger barrage version of Shigan. Who's-Who possesses great skill in Busoshoku Haki. He can harden select parts of his transformed body, such as his cat fangs and clawed fingers, thereby boosting his durability and strengthening his physical attacks. However, despite his skill, his Busoshoku Haki-hardened fingers broke against Jinbe's own hardened body, and Jinbe crushed Who's-Who's hardened wrists in his grip. Who's-Who possesses the ability to use Kenbunsoku Haki. Who's-Who carries a straight-bladed dagger disguised as a long katana. It sports a hilt with pink tsuka-ito that through rhombus gaps shows the white hilt wrapping below (in the anime having red tsuka-ito over pink wrapping), alongside a golden, quatrefoil-shaped tsuba. The pink saya is patterned with white, multi-petaled flower motifs and, due to its length, greatly belies the blade's shortness."},

He has white fluffy hair and buck teeth, with spiral-designs on his cheek, and his eyes seem to extend off of his facewith his skin and eyelids as well. Wanze wears a black shirt unbuttoned, revealing his chest, a yellow scarf, black pants with an orange belt, and roller skates. The back of his jacket reads \"MAD\". On both his forearms, Wanze has tattooed the kanji  (kanji meaning \"fist\"?). He also wears a white chef's jacket with the World Government's symbol on its back, to which he removes prior to battle. After getting hit by Sanji's Parage Shot, Wanze's face is molded into something that resembles a stereotypical bishonen; ironically, he finds this form to be rather ugly. His face changes back to its former appearance after a kick to his torso from Sanji.", "personality": "Wanze is loud, obnoxious and explicitly annoying who often acts in a whimsical or uncontrolled manner, which is often done to goad his enemies into underestimating him and his abilities. As a master in Ramen Kenpo, Wanze also takes pride in his fighting style and acts confident in showing his enemies when he states that CP9 had chose him on the train to keep intruders out. However, he is a bit dense and can be short tempered. Furthermore, he oddly becomes dizzy when he sees spirals, such as Sanji's eyebrow. One of the main key features of Wanze is his constant facial expression (the \"dumb\" smile) that never changes even when he claims to be scared, which often annoys and provokes his enemies. However, he did get genuinely mad when Sanji changed him into a bishonen and claimed to be mutilated. Given his loyalty to the World Government and Cipher Pol, Wanze is an advocate for Absolute Justice and is naturally prejudiced against criminals that threaten them regardless of their character. As such he is not above slandering and disparaging Nico Robin over her infamous reputation much to Sanji's anger. Like other One Piece characters, Wanze has his own Laughter Style, starting it with \"Sa\" (i.e. Sasasasasasa!). He also tends to say a verbal tic, \"Go-go-go!\", when he is excited.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wanze is CP7's melee fighting expert, whose skills serve as additional security for CP9's return voyage to Enies Lobby. He is quite analytical, as he was able to figure out Sanji's weakness (in that immobilizing his legs makes him powerless) after fighting with him for only a few minutes. Wanze is a chef who specializes in making ramen out of his own body by a process of eating flour, kneading the dough in his mouth, and cutting it with his fishnet-shaped nose hairs into noodles which are extracted out of his nose. He mainly uses his ramen cooking specialty as part of his own fighting style, Ramen Kenpo. In battle, Wanze can control his self-made ramen in different techniques, which includes shooting noodles out of his nose at highspeed, as well as kneading ramen to form a battle suit. Alongside his Ramen Kenpo, Wanze uses various bladed weapons. He also wears a pair of roller skates with circular blades as wheels, which can ignite fire from friction and enhance his kicks. He also throws kitchen knives and wields a large poisoned knife."},

{"name": "Wapol", "episode": "Episode 131", "chapter": "Chapter 79", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Wapol is an overweight man with an unusual appearance. He has dark violet hair and a cylinder-shaped jaw made up of tin plates, hence his epithet. When Wapol uses his Slim-Up technique, he \"eats\" his body and becomes slim. During the Drum Island arc, he used to dress in tin-plate armor and a hooded cape made from White Walkie skin. He was also wearing brown thick gloves. He spotted a pair of purple and orange woolen shorts and a brown belt around his waist and a pair of thick short boots. When he was the ruler of the Drum Peak, he was wearing the same attire but the tin-plate armor. Instead he was wearing a grey shirt and his gloves had no fur on their upper edge. After the timeskip, as the monarch of the Black Drum Kingdom he spots a different attire. He wears another shirt and when it comes to his lower body, he wears a skirt with a black pattern, a pair of black sharp pointy sandals. He still has his hooded cape and he wears black gloves. His hair is now white and he has grown a black mustache and a goatee.", "personality": "Wapol was once a prince of the region who succeeded his father, a King beloved by the people of Drum, as monarch when his father died. Wapol however, proved to be a spoiled and corrupt king, who held not even the slightest regard for his people. He was also cowardly and disloyal, fleeing his kingdom without even fighting back when the Blackbeard Pirates attacked, taking with him the doctors and soldiers while leaving his remaining subjects to fend for themselves. His self-centered actions ruined the kingdom's reputation, which caused all the citizens to both fear and hate him. He ruled simply to satisfy his selfish desires and he brutally beat anyone who disobeyed him. He was callous towards his people and never appears to care for their safety. Wapol loved to dominate over others with his family's power and wealth, and truly believed that none should dare question his authority. Wapol in particular has little to no understanding of politics or governmental issues, foolishly believing that everything is fine as long as it does not affect his kingdom directly. Being used to having everything go his way, he was childish enough to attack 10 year-old Nefertari Vivi, in the hopes of instigating a full-scale war, simply for being scolded by her father for being irresponsible, and grew furious when she did not blame him for this act of spite. Perhaps because of his selfish nature to desire what he wants, Wapol is unable to learn from his mistakes, as even though he lived as a homeless man and was forced to make a living by selling toys, he made an enormous fortune and became just as selfish and arrogant as he was while as king. In fact, he is one to hold grudges, as he only intended to attend Levely solely so he could get revenge on Dalton for becoming the new ruler of his old Kingdom, however he does not appear to bear a grudge against Luffy, as he mentioned that the latter's actions allowed him to regain power and a new kingdom. Despite so, he has become more considerate as despite disliking Cobra, he is horrified to find him unreasonably assassinated by the Five Elders simply for learning Imus existence. After escaping with Vivi, he also did not immediately divulge what he saw due to her father being killed which he knew would be difficult for her to accept. Though Wapol may look and act foolishly, he is by no means stupid, as demonstrated when he saw through Nami's lies and managed to figure out an effective, though cruel and corrupt method of controlling the citizens. Before Wapol's ascension to power, the Drum Kingdom possessed the most numerous and skilled doctors in all of the Grand Line. He took the twenty most skilled for himself while banishing or murdering the rest, to ensure that his subjects would be absolutely loyal and grovel at his feet for medical attention. He is also not foolish enough to defy the World Nobles. Despite his previous belief that the World Government would ensure that the Revolutionaries would be unable to harm him or his kingdom, he knew the consequences of stumbling onto the secret holder of the Empty Throne, casting aside any delusion that he is safe from harm so long as he is affiliated with the organization. Wapol is very gluttonous, which he takes to the extreme with his Devil Fruit powers. He eats as he pleases, non-stop, and caused massive collateral damage to cities which led him to be arrested once. He also has a habit of saying kaba (\"hippo\") instead of saying baka (\"idiot\"). This, along with his spoiled and childish personality, makes him a somewhat comedic villain, despite his cruelty. He also seems willing to use cannibalism, as seen when he attempted to eat Luffy and later, in Drum, after hearing from Kuromarimo that Doctor Kureha lives in his castle, he said he was going to eat her. Wapol has a unique face-fault when left utterly dumbstruck once something terrible happens at his expense- a very wide-eyed blank stare with veins bulging out of his eyes, coupled with a stupefied smile, giving off an overall look that suggests he is about to snap in a psychotic rage. He does have a sense of caution when he tells Nefertari Vivi to pipe down since there are many Den Den Mushi in the World Economy News Paper's blimp. Like many characters in One Piece, Wapol has a distinct laugh: starting with either \"Ma\" or a long \"Ma\" (i.e Mahahahahaha!/Maaaaaahahahahaha).", "abilities_and_powers": "As king of the Black Drum Kingdom, Wapol has full authority over the kingdom and its citizens, and is able to attend Levely. He formerly possessed this authority on Drum Island before he fled and was eventually deposed. Wapol possesses a surprising amount of cunning, as he came up with a strategy to subjugate his country and later on, he came up with another strategy to catch Dr. Hiriluk by exploiting his personality. During his final fight with Luffy and Chopper, Wapol also thought of several ideas to give him an advantage, such as merging his two servants and consuming his castle's super cannon. He also proved himself to be a skilled businessman, having successfully created an entire toy enterprise based on a metal he (unintentionally) discovered, to such an astounding popularity and success that he became even richer than when he was king of Drum Kingdom, and was acknowledged by the World Nobles that they awarded him a new kingdom. He is also observant with a strong sense of danger as after he secretly discovered Cobra being killed for learning about Imus existence, he quick witted enough to hurriedly escaped due to knowing he will be implicated and assassinated by the Five Elders, while contacting Morgans as he knew only the famous journalists connections can help him escape from the World Government. He seems to lack battle or combat experience, and he mainly relies on his henchmen to perform such tasks. While living as a pirate, he and his crew were capable of surviving on the treacherous waters of the Grand Line. Wapol and his cabinet managed to subdue an entire nation, and Wapol easily defeated Dalton in his \"ultimate form\". It should be noted that Wapol did not get the chance to use this ultimate form during his battle with Luffy, which he would have achieved by eating all of Drum Castle's weapons, because Nami stole the key to the armory from him. Despite his obesity, Wapol has impressive durability, having quickly gotten back up after Dalton's sword strike on him and two consecutive punches in the face by Luffy. He can become rather agile after using the slim Wapol technique. Wapol ate the Baku Baku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to expand his mouth and eat virtually anything, as well as transform his body to replicate the characteristics and function of whatever he's eaten in the most recent 24 hours. For example, if he eats a cannon, then he can transform a part of his body into a cannon. He is capable of using multiple manifestations at once. He also has the ability to reconfigure ingested objects in his belly and regurgitate them, creating something new. He used this ability to produce a new shape-memory steel called Wapometal. He can even use this power to devour people whole and \"combine\" them within himself, allowing him to combine his subordinates into a single more powerful warrior. Wapol can devour his own body until only his lower jaw is left, then regurgitate himself with his body temporarily altered to be better suited for combat. Wapol had in his possession the Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon. Wapol was going to use it to defeat Monkey D. Luffy but he could not get the cannon working due to the freezing conditions and the cannon barrels becoming a nest for Snow Birds."},

When first meeting Luffy's group, Wanda wore Nami's long blue jeans, high-heeled boots, and green-white striped bikini top after Nami lent them to her. Wanda also wears the Musketeer's blue cape and another blue cloth tied around her jeans. During the Beasts Pirates's invasion, Wanda wore a light blue open-necked shirt, white jeans shorts, calf-height brown boots and a white cavalier hat. After arriving at Wano Country, Wanda switched to a pink-colored kimono. As a child, Wanda had shorter hair, a smaller snout, and wore a light pink dress, magenta shoes, and the Musketeer's blue cape.", "personality": "Wanda is unprejudiced and judges others by who they are rather than by what they look like. She is helpful to strangers, having assisted the Straw Hat Pirates by giving them directions on Zou and protected Monkey D. Luffy from the guardians of the Whale Forest. She sometimes says things without considering their context. When she affectionately referred to Brook as a corpse, the Straw Hat Pirates thought she was talking about the dead body of one of their crewmates. However, she can be extremely emotional at times, which can affect her judgement. One instance is when she immediately attacked the Straw Hats after mistaking them for members of the Beasts Pirates upon sight, due to the emotional trauma they inflicted upon her and her people, but then calmed down after Pedro explained the situation. Similar to a dog, she has a habit of licking the faces of others as a way of displaying affection, as demonstrated when she licked Luffy's face on two separate occasions. Also, like most canine minks, she finds Brook to be delicious because his body is comprised exclusively of bones.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wanda holds a great deal of respect among her fellow minks, such that Pedro immediately had the Guardians withdraw from their confrontation with Monkey D. Luffy when she asked him to do so. As a member of the Musketeers, Wanda is a very powerful warrior. Like all minks, Wanda can use Electro. As a Kingsbird, she possesses very large amounts of stamina, which allows her to be active at all hours of the day. She also possesses considerable resistance to toxins, as demonstrated when she remained able to stand and fight to a degree even after being badly weakened by deadly poisonous gas, whereas most of the other minks were completely debilitated by the lethal Koro gas. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Wanda is able to awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Wanda's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified. Using this form has a risk as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long. However, she can revert back to her normal form by blocking her eyes from the moonlight. As a member of the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad, Wanda possesses high level of skill in swordsmanship. In the anime, she could hold her own against a large Gifter in a sword fight and even disarm him of his sword. She was only taken off guard when the Gifter used his Artificial Zoan abilities. Wanda wields a cutlass, which she can channel Electro through, along with a stick of dynamite."},

His hands are disproportionately large for his body and have a tattoo on the back of them that matches the one on his forehead. He has black hair that is slicked back and sticks up in a curl on the back of his head. In the anime, his skin is rather pale. Like most members of the crew, he wears a magenta suit coupled with a yellow cravat and a black coat draped over his shoulders. His coat has a feathered collar and his eyes are covered by a pair of small round sunglasses. He also has a pair of holsters where he keeps his eponymous 'Monster Guns', a pair of large revolvers.", "personality": "Vito is a man who treats his superiors with respect, making sure to let others know about the kind of people they're dealing with. Despite his high regard for his bosses, he recognizes that their actions are often quite cruel and selfish, and expresses a measured degree of sympathy for those negatively impacted by them. This is best shown when he gave Sanji a photo of his bride-to-be, in order to soften the blow of his forcefully arranged marriage. Vito is a big fan of the Germa 66, consistently profusing his admiration for the group and holding its members in high regard. Vito is talkative and has a tendency to follow people around, even when they do not desire his company. He also has a tendency to put people off with his mannerisms, especially when his tongue is involved. He is also compassionate, as he readily helped Sanji by ambushing Bobbin, despite Sanji's previous rude and disrespectful attitude towards him. Vito also specifically explained to Sanji the consequences of refusing to participate in Big Mom's Tea Party so the latter would be more careful in choosing to refuse. While helping Chiffon search for her twin sister Lola at Dressrosa, Vito lend a helping hand to citizens who were mysteriously attacked.

Vito is also shown to have a strong will, being able to resist Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki. After Bege's assassination attempt on Big Mom failed, he swiftly outran the Big Mom Pirates who were after them. Vito appears to be highly skilled in sneak attacks, as he laid a successful ambush on Bobbin, who is a powerful pirate and noted to be a heavyweight in the Big Mom Pirates. Vito appears to be extremely skilled in marksmanship. With the element of surprise, Vito easily shot down Bobbin, who is a very powerful member of the Big Mom Pirates. Alongside Gotti, Vito was entrusted by Bege to use a KX Launcher to assassinate Big Mom, further proving his capabilities. He carries a pair of dark revolver pistols, from which he earned his epithet, that are big enough for him to use with his large hands.

Furthermore, Vitan also wears a metal hat and a pair of gray, possibly metal pants with a green sash around it. In his original sketch, Vitan had less of a robotic look, but instead appeared to be wearing some sort of garment with frills in the center.", "personality": "Vitan is very loyal to Whitebeard since he was willing to risk his own life to follow the orders of the Emperor to rescue Portgas D.

His hands are webbed. He has a big, round face, with a large mouth full of massive, round teeth quite distant from one another, and child-like eyes. He has some stubble on his chin and dark hair surrounding his head, taking the shape of a protrusion pointing upward at the top, which also covers a part of his shoulders. His whole body is also quite hairy. He apparently wears a pair of extremely loose pants paired with a dark indument tied around his waist, and has been seen walking barefoot.

Contrary to the nasty reputation and behavior of his crew and captain, Wadatsumi seems to be more of a gentle and kind nature, as he destroyed two towns only due to sheer carelessness, which he apologized for in a genuinely remorseful manner, and cheerfully celebrated with the citizens upon resolving the situation. Another example was at Whole Cake Island, where after he reunited with some of the Straw Hat crew, Wadatsumi apologized for the trouble he gave them before at Fish-Man Island.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his great size, and the fact that he is a fish-man, he is extremely powerful. He hurt Ankoro, a fish several times the size of the Thousand Sunny, with a single punch despite not meaning to. He is also capable of picking up, carrying, and throwing entire buildings. He helped Jinbe transport an enormous and heavy poneglyph. Because of his size, he can easily create disturbances in the water; simply bursting out of the sea in the middle of the Big Mom Pirates' fleet was enough to send several ships flying into the distance. As a fish-man, he is capable of breathing underwater as well as surviving the crushing pressure of 10,000 meters below sea level. Being a tiger blowfish fish-man, he is also capable of inflating himself, thus increasing his already enormous size.

Along with the red rose on her hair, she wears round earrings, purple stiletto heels, and a long, sleeveless white Flamenco dress with violet polka dots and maroon frills. At age 19, ten years before joining the Donquixote Pirates, Viola wore her hair in a side-parted, chin-length bob with a pink hairband. She was wearing a long dress with a black top and a light and frilly bottom. As a child, Viola was seen wearing dresses with puffy shoulders, and her hair was in a shorter, rounded bob.

She has no qualms about using violence when necessary, as shown when she kicked Sanji full-force in the face, leaving him bleeding and barely conscious. Her ruthless behavior is actually a symptom of a profound cynicism; not a single man she has ever been involved with has been honest with her, a fact that her powers allowed her to discover. Deep down, she has a kind heart that was moved by Sanji's honesty and kindness, leading her to help him in spite of the consequences. The true Viola is nobler than her alias Violet, as she sacrificed her own freedom in order to spare her father's life. She never felt true loyalty to any king but her father. Even while working for the Donquixote Family, she kept tabs on the Tontattas' progress without revealing their plans to Doflamingo. Prior to her family's dethronement, Viola showed a more amiable and trusting personality, trying to persuade her sister to trust Kyros despite his background.", "abilities_and_powers": "Viola is a very graceful flamenco dancer. She is skilled in manipulating others and, as an assassin of the Trebol Army held in high regards, is an accomplished fighter. Her combat ability was demonstrated when she was able to severely wound Sanji, although comparing their respective strengths is somewhat pointless, given that he would die before fighting back. As the princess of Dressrosa, she has great authority over the country, a status that was taken away when her family was dethroned by Doflamingo until his defeat. As a former officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had command over the 2000 soldiers. Viola ate the Giro Giro no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to see through solid objects and over vast distances. It also allows her to see into peoples minds and memories. She activates her power by forming a circle with her thumb and index finger and looking through the circle like a lens. With her ability to see through solid objects, she can inspect her opponents by seeing through their clothing and even through their skin, allowing her to make sure they dont have any hidden surprises. Additionally, she can use her powers to view anything within a 4,000-kilometer radius; she can use her farsight in all directions at once and see things in great detail. Since she has the power to read other people's minds, and even view their memories, she is impossible to deceive. This power is exceptionally useful for interrogation. It was this ability that let her see through all the men who attempted to lie to her. Notably, Viola can also gigantify her tears and subsequently detach and manipulate them, using them to pursue her opponents and attack them with blunt force. Viola possesses a pistol and was shown using it proficiently when she shot at a screen displaying the Corrida Colosseum Block D battle. When confronting Doflamingo, she was seen wielding a knife.

She also has purple eyes (blue in the anime), and occasionally wears light pink lipstick. Like all the Vinsmoke siblings, she has distinctive curly eyebrows that form a spiral resembling the number \"6\". However, unlike her brothers Sanji and Yonji, her eyebrows appear to swirl symmetrically in opposing directions. Both of her thighs are tattooed with a number \"6\", referring to the name of the organization \"Germa 66\". When commanding the forces of Germa 66, Reiju wears a raid suit, comprising a light pink dress with a split in the center going down to her stomach and her navel, and covered by gold target-shaped symbolsreferences to the number \"0\" (Rei) in her name. She also wears dark pink gauntlets, a blue ascot, a pair of black headphones with the number \"66\" on them, and a patterned purple and black cloak shaped like the wings of a moth. Outside of her raid suit, Reiju has been shown wearing a skinny purple headband in her hair, a short white satiny dress with a frilled neckline and a pink cravat, and dark high heels. For formal functions, she also wears a red, thigh-length royal cape that is clasped in front of her neck. In the Whole Cake Chateau infirmary, Reiju wore a white frilled dress shirt, a dark thong, and a bandage wrapped around her left leg. During the Tea Party, Reiju changed into a short, sleeveless dress with a frilled V-neckline, as well as dark tights that reach halfway up her thighs. She wore a light-colored royal cape draped over a single shoulder. In the anime, her outfit colors are inverted, with her dark shirt being light pink, her thighs are white and her cape is pink. When chaos broke out, she changed back into her raid suit. As a child, Reiju had shorter hair, but wore a similar dark headband. She has been shown wearing a light pink dress with the letter \"Z\" on the right side, as well as other dresses featuring the number \"0\" in various forms, white boots, and a dark ascot around her neck. As the oldest child of her family, she was formerly taller than her brothers before being outgrown by all of them by the time they reached adulthood.", "personality": "Unlike her cruel and abusive brothers, Reiju can be kind and empathetic, but this is frequently masked by a cool, callous demeanor due to the militarism of her family and her father's stern disdain for compassion. As a result, Reiju prefers to show kindness only when it will not endanger her own comfort or safety. During her childhood, Reiju would openly laugh at Sanji's misery as he was enduring his brothers' vicious acts of cruelty; however, she confided to Sanji that she only laughed with their brothers to avoid being subjected to similar cruel bullying herself, as she would treat him with care and sympathy when they were not around. Reiju also expressed concern for Sanji when it was said that he had died (but, as usual, she hid her concern behind a smile). She even cried in secret as she listened to their father cast Sanji out of the family, before helping him escape onto the Orbit and encouraging him to find friends on the sea. Her instinct for self-preservation resurfaced when she could not understand why Sanji would return to a home that abuses him, just for the sake of protecting his mentor. However, to this day, Sanji remembers Reiju and their mother as the only members of his family to treat him with any degree of compassion. Reiju's general manner is mild and reserved, and she very rarely reveals her true thoughts and feelings to others. Throughout her life, she has disguised her shame and disdain for her Vinsmoke heritage behind an apparent enjoyment of their luxurious royal lifestyle, and a false respect for their family's historical strength, achievements, and privileges. In truth, however, Reiju's innate sense of morality leads her to believe that her kingdom is nothing but a war machine that the world would be better off without. This view applies especially to her father and brothers (excluding Sanji), but also to herself and her own actions as a mercenary. Like her brother Ichiji, Reiju also prefers to think or muse silently to herself as she watches certain developments unfold, hiding her true thoughts and feelings behind an enigmatic smile. Indeed, the only person to whom she has ever openly expressed her true thoughts and feelings, whether as a child or an adult, is Sanji. Reiju has been shown to possess great intelligence and intuition, as she was the only person (among both her family and the Straw Hats) to suspect that Pudding may not be what she seemed. She has also exhibited a calculating side; for example, she appears to be aware of Sanji's weakness for attractive women, showing him ten beautiful chambermaids that would be at his beck and call in order to convince him to accept his arranged marriage. She also easily charmed the Sanji retrieval team in their first meeting, humiliating Yonji and apologizing for his behavior in order to prevent a confrontation with the Straw Hats. Reiju's occasional actions and manner of speech can be slightly flirtatious. Even before she was properly introduced to Luffy, she unabashedly placed her mouth over his in order to suck out the poison which was festering throughout his body.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to being a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Reiju possesses political power over the Germa Kingdom, and over the World Government. Unlike the members of most royal families, she (as well as her father and siblings) is also a commander of their kingdom's military, directly leading their forces in combat and other activities. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Reiju also has access to the advanced technology developed by her family as well as their extravagant wealth. Reiju has sharp intuition, as she had some suspicion that Pudding was not the kind person she appeared to be, a feat that Pudding herself complimented. She also has an excellent memory, as she is able to perfectly recall an intense argument between her parents when she was only three years old. She is shown to have a strong will, as she was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream. Due to genetic enhancements, Reiju possesses immense superhuman physical abilities that were additionally honed through a stringent training regimen from a young age. Like her brothers, she has an outer skeleton known as an Exoskeleton (, Gaikokkaku?), which allows her to take more damage than a normal human. She is noted to possess an extraordinary recovery rate from injury. Reiju has immense strength, being capable of bending metal bars at a young age. With a single hand, she grabbed a rampaging Luffy who was wreaking havoc in Whole Cake Chateau and quickly pulled him into the infirmary. Additionally, like Sanji, Niji, and Judge, Reiju is also extremely proficient in using powerful kicks, as she kicked Yonji (another genetically enhanced human and a fellow Germa commander) off their ship and into the sea, despite his attempt to defend against her. She also successfully used kicks against Charlotte Smoothie, one of Big Mom's Sweet Commanders, in order to force Smoothie to release Nami. Reiju is also capable of moving at rapid speeds and was fast enough to instantly evade Perospero's candy wave. Reiju has great medical knowledge. As a child, she would often treat Sanji's grievous wounds from his brothers' brutal beatings. Her medical knowledge also extends to toxicology due to her affinity for poisons. She could accurately identify Luffy's symptoms with the poison which had caused them and also estimate how much of the poison he had consumed. As a result of her genetic enhancements, Reiju wields poison-based powers that have garnered her the epithet of \"Poison Pink.\" She can suck poison out of people via mouth-to-mouth and ingest it while having exhibited immense immunity to the most virulent of poisons, such as extremely lethal doses of an Armored Stonefish's skin poison, as shown when she saved Luffy. Said poison was said to be more than enough to kill any normal human instantaneously, as well as a giant even, and was causing Luffy, who has himself built up an extreme poison resistance, to debilitate to the brink of death in no time. Thanks to her ability, Reiju casually extracted and consumed said poison (and with it the rash it had brought upon) without suffering any ill effects (even noting it to be a delicacy). It was shown that when she is consuming poison, the butterfly wings of her outfit gain additional rings on their pattern. Reiju is also capable of secreting poison from her body and combining it with physical attacks. The poison is potent enough to affect powerful enemies such as Sweet Commander Smoothie, who called it troublesome. Due to her family's technological prowess, Reiju possesses a raid suit which she wears in combat. It protects her from fire, bullets, and strong blows. The Raid Suit protected her when Big Mom used Prometheus against her. It also provides her with jet-propelled boots."},
{"name": "Vista", "episode": "Episode 552", "chapter": "Chapter ", "year": 2009, "note": "His name was revealed by Mihawk in Chapter 561.", "appearance": "Vista is a tall (around Jinbe's height), muscular, broad-chested, tanned man with a curly, black mustache, a dark blue top hat, and an earring in each ear. He wears a semi-open dark blue shirt with a white diamond stripe-pattern near the top that reveals some of his hairy chest, as well as a cape that his shirt, and white gloves. He also wears light blue pants with a belt that holds two sword sheaths, one on each side. He wields two sabers, one in each hand. During Ace's flashbacks, he was shown with shorter hair and wore different attire, consisting of some sort of open jacket and his trademark hat. He did not wear gloves then. He also appeared much slimmer and less muscular than he currently is. Vista was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates 22 years ago and had his trademark mustache and top hat then as well. When Vista was a little boy, he wore his hair in a ponytail, and had bangs that hung in his forehead. He sported a black shirt, with a white collar and cross designs on either side of the chest. He also had black pants, and black shoes. He was seen holding a wooden training sword, practicing his swordsmanship skills.", "personality": "Like all division commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, Vista seems to be very loyal to Whitebeard. He also seems to be modest. He expressed a desire to fight Dracule Mihawk and was happy that he got to cross blades with him. He also expressed a great hatred for Blackbeard as when he mocked Whitebeard's inability to save his crewmate, Vista had to be held back from attacking him.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the 5th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Vista has authority over the lower-ranking members of the crew. He has also been stated to be the strongest swordsman of the Whitebeard Pirates. He is a very experienced veteran, as he was shown as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger. He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as commander. He was the one individual Marco specifically commanded and entrusted Luffy's protection to. Even Dracule Mihawk acknowledges his reputation. Another indication of Vista's strength is that during the Summit War of Marineford, despite having fought against individual Warlords of the Sea and admirals as well as numerous Marine officers, he sustained no significant injuries. Vista possesses immense physical strength, as he is able to match against Dracule Mihawk who is known as the strongest swordsman in the world. He was capable of deflecting an attack from an axe-wielding giant, as well as easily slice down cannonballs in midair. Vista has extraordinary mastery in dual wielding swordsmanship and even Mihawk acknowledges his skills. He even managed to deflect Mihawk's flying slash attack which is powerful enough to cut through battleships. In the anime, he was also able to block bullets with his swords to protect his allies from being shot while escaping. Vista possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki, as shown when he fought against Akainu. Vista possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Vista wields a pair of sabers with purple hilts that are visibly distinguishable from another by their different sheaths attached to his waist. They are especially durable, withstanding a clash with Mihawk's Yoru. In the anime, some of his attacks generate red flower petals (in a similar way pink flower petals materialize whenever Nico Robin uses her abilities), which befits his epithet \"Flower Sword\"; also in the anime, Vista has so far only produced rose petals, but mentioned that he could produce other types of flower petals as well. Whether this means he is a Devil Fruit user has yet to be determined."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Yonji", "episode": "Episode 825", "chapter": "Chapter 783", "year": 2016, "note": "", "appearance": "As noted by the Straw Hats, Yonji heavily resembles his brother Sanji. He has almost identical facial features, including the distinctive curly eyebrows that resemble the numeral 6 common to the Vinsmoke siblings. However, his hair is green and slicked back into a cowlick, his eyebrows curl in the inverse direction (both face the left side of his face), and he lacks facial hair. He is also more muscular than his brothers, who all have comparatively slim builds, and notably taller than them despite being the youngest child. When commanding the forces of Germa 66, Yonji wears a green raid suit, comprising a shirt bearing the number \"66\" in gold, and a black hooded cloak bearing a green \"4\" on the left. He wears a striped belt with the Germa 66 symbol as a belt buckle, metal gloves, an orange ascot, sunglasses, and black earphones on the top of his head. When outside of his combat attire, Yonji wears a light-colored short sleeved shirt with a frilled collar, along with a striped belt and plain black pants. For formal functions, he also wears a dark floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp. During the Tea Party, Yonji changed into a green suit, comprised of a double-breasted jacket over a white collared shirt, green pants, and brown gloves. He also wore a white royal cape similar to the one he was wearing previously, but shorter, light-colored, and clasped together with two chains. Once chaos broke out, Yonji changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Yonji's hair was styled with a small cowlick on top of his head. He also wore a light green shirt with the number \"4\" on it, an orange bandana around his neck, white pants, and brown boots.", "personality": "Yonji has been described as callous and stingy, refusing to help a dying Luffy and challenging the Straw Hats to plunder the Germa 66 ship for the cure for Luffy's condition. His elder sister, Reiju, claimed that he was rotten to the core. Yonji seems to take amusement in instigating or observing conflict, as he offered to lead Sanji to Niji for a fight with a smile and acted similarly when he tried to goad the Straw Hats into attacking him. He is also proud, getting angry at Reiju when she humiliated him in front of the Straw Hats. This proud nature was in evidence again when, upon suffering defeat at Sanji's hands, Yonji was infuriated and swore to make the latter pay for his actions. Since birth, Yonji is incapable of sympathy and empathy due to the genetic modifications done by his father. As a child, Yonji took part in bullying Sanji, joining his two eldest brothers in mercilessly beating and mocking Sanji's compassion in preparing food for others. This shows that he neither tolerates nor values any such trait, which he believed was worthless to royals. In the present day, Sanji claims that, despite his hopes to the contrary, all of the members of his family have only gotten worse with time. Like several other members of his family, Yonji appears to be arrogant (to the point of being delusional), believing he could defeat Luffy even though he was defeated by Sanji. Furthermore, after Big Mom revealed her treachery, Yonji was unmoved even by the prospect of his own death, laughing at the desperation of their situation. Despite his arrogance and cruel nature, Yonji has a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude, as after Sanji saved his life, Yonji repaid the favor by helping to protect his allies, namely Carrot from Daifuku and saved Sanji and Luffy from an ambush by the Big Mom Pirate's allowing them both to escape from Cacao Island. Yonji is also very mindful of his family's affairs, deciding to not get involved with the Straw Hats in order to ensure that Sanji's wedding would not be jeopardized. He also tried to reprimand Sanji after hearing that Sanji was refusing to cooperate with their family's plans for an alliance with Big Mom. As Nami observed, Yonji, like his older brother Sanji, exhibits lecherous qualities. He is immediately struck by Nami's beauty, and is seen ogling Nami's bounty poster when Germa 66 depart from their brief meeting with the Straw Hats. After witnessing Nami slapping Sanji, he exclaims that he is into her fiery personality. Furthermore, like Sanji, he has also been shown to allow his lust to cloud his better judgement; he absentmindedly expresses his desire to marry Charlotte Pudding himself due to her beauty, prompting Ichiji and Niji to remind him that marrying into her family would not bode well for them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being part of the Vinsmoke Family, Yonji possesses political power over the Germa Kingdom, as well the World Government. Unlike the members of most royal families, he (as well as his father and siblings) is also a commander of his kingdom's military, directly leading their forces in combat and other activities. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Yonji also has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. Yonji's father, Vinsmoke Judge, who has a extremely strict standard for strength, claimed that he was a formidable fighter. However, after a hostile encounter with Sanji, it is noted that his strength is inferior to his older brother's. While Sanji was visibly unharmed after their fight, Yonji's face was severely deformed and required treatment. Yonji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki and remained conscious from her loud scream. Like his other siblings, Yonji was given genetic enhancements which gave him great superhuman physical abilities. Judge's aide stated that Yonji's strength and agility had matured into the level of adult men by the time he was a young child. He possesses an outer skeleton which gives him a very strong degree of durability, as he appeared largely unharmed by his sister Reiju's kick despite her using enough force to send him flying several meters away. After his fight with Sanji, Yonji's face somehow became deformed as though it was a piece of dented metal; a doctor attempted to repair it appropriately, using first a hammer and then a machine press. Neither of these processes induced much pain or any injury in Yonji. He also has quick reaction speed, as he was able to put up a defense against Reiju's unexpected kick. He has tremendous tolerance for alcohol, as he and his brothers continued to drink large quantities unaffected while the barmaids all fell intoxicated. He also underwent extensive combat training to lead Germa 66 as a commander. Even Judge was surprised at Yonji's defeat as he considered Yonji a formidable fighter. When given back his raid suit, Yonji was able to subdue Charlotte Daifuku's genie, which had previously incapacitated Sanji (though this was due to it being a surprise attack). Despite previously receiving injuries from Big Mom, Yonji, along with his siblings, was still strong enough to easily overpower the pursuers that were sent after his family. Yonji's bodily modifications have given him the title Winch Green. He wears a device on his right forearm that acts as a winch, allowing him to extend his hand with a cable to grab faraway objects and opponents. His hand possesses immense punching and gripping strength, allowing him to shatter objects as large as Charlotte Yuen's massive staff orb and to grip the large heads of Yuen and Charlotte Daifuku's genie with overwhelming strength. It is unknown if his left arm has the same abilities. Due to his family's technological prowess, Yonji possesses a raid suit which he wears in combat. It protects him from fire, bullets, and strong blows. It also provides him with jet-propelled boots."},

{"name": "Vinsmoke Judge", "episode": "Episode 832", "chapter": "Chapter 793", "year": 2016, "note": "He first appeared as a fictional character in the Sora, Warrior of the Sea comic strip in Episode 783.", "appearance": "Judge is a large man with long golden hair which reaches his waist. He has a long and thin black mustache which spikes upwards, a thin and small beard, and a prominent cleft chin. He always wears a golden helmet, which was later destroyed during his clash with Big Mom. Much like his children, Judge has curved eyebrows, although they are relatively thicker. He usually wears his Raid Suit, which is composed of a gray robe with the number \"66\" on the bottom front, a large orange cape, a belt with the number \"66\" on the buckle, dark gloves, and boots with jet propellers that allow him to levitate in the air once activated. At the Tea Party, Judge changed into a dark grey suit, comprised of a grey shirt, white tie, trousers, and a double-breasted jacket. On top of the suit, he wore an orange, single-shoulder royal cloak clasped in front of his neck. Thirteen years ago, Judge wore an outfit similar to the one he wears in the present, but with different coloring. Judge did not wear a helmet during his time with MADS (thus exposing his eyebrows) and wore a simple suit instead of his Raid one. He was also far leaner and with shorter hair. His mustache would start growing around this time.", "personality": "Judge exhibits a typical royal hauteur, holding the firm belief that royalty is meant to be served, not to serve others. He disowns his third son, Sanji, after learning about Sanji's \"disgusting\" habit of cooking for others (which he equates with serving others). It has been shown that he passed these attitudes down to his children, as his other sons use the same rationale to justify bullying Sanji during their childhood, and his daughter is seemingly proud of the status and privileges of being born into royalty, but in truth actually despises her father and his beliefs. As part of this pride, Judge is preoccupied with recapturing the past glories of the Vinsmoke Family; for this reason, his lifelong ambition is to retake the entire North Blue, as his ancestors once did. Ironically, it was his desire for power and tremendous arrogance that nearly led to the deaths of himself and his family when Big Mom deceived him in forming an alliance only to betray him and nearly kill him. He has proven that he will not hesitate to use any means to accomplish his goals, including genetically modifying his children into superhumans, and going as far as to tell his wife that he was content with turning their sons into monsters, as long as they win wars. When his wife maintained her opposition, he forced her to undergo the surgery which would instill the modifications, and he was furious at his third son when he failed to exhibit any enhancements from the surgery. As Sanji prepared to leave the family, Judge gave him only one condition: that Sanji never associate himself with Judge or the Vinsmoke name again, since he considered Sanji his greatest failure and shame. Judge also loathes compassion and kindness, as he believes it makes people weak and useless; presumably for similar reasons, Judge does not seem too fond of chivalry (as seen when he called Sanji's chivalry a \"bad influence\" from Zeff). As such, he modified his sons to remove their emotions and ensure they would become strong while believing they were perfect. He expressed rage and despised Sanji heavily for showing such emotions, believing that Sora's kindness in helping the weak is worthless and greatly scorned Sanji due to his kindness. Ironically, Judge was in disbelief when he saw Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji expressing a lack of care at their imminent demise after they fell into the Big Mom Pirates' trap. Even after witnessing the flaw in their design and seeing that the very emotions that Sanji possesses had saved him and his family, Judge still considers such emotions useless and cruelly mocked Sanji in front of the Sanji Retrieval Team. When he aided the Straw Hats against Smoothie's fleet, he angrily yelled at Luffy, demanding to know why he had traveled to Totto Land to save Sanji while listing off all the things he despises about Sanji (e.g compassion and having emotions). When Luffy simply thanked Judge for aiding them, Judge was furious and continuously questioned the Straw Hat captain as the Straw Hats sailed away. As a king, Judge has exhibited significant political astuteness. He understood the full implications of Doflamingo's fall from power, including its impact on the war on Broc Coli Island. He also weighed up Germa's current privileges within the World Government against the benefits of an alliance with Big Mom, before deciding that losing the right to attend Levely was far exceeded by gaining the manpower to retake North Blue. He is naturally cautious when making major political moves, and is conscious not to make commitments without taking measures to avert potential difficulties; when dealing with Big Mom, he sought out his estranged third son specifically because any threat or danger to Sanji would not affect him, and he planned to hold Pudding hostage in the Germa Kingdom to prevent Big Mom from backstabbing him after the wedding. However, Judge still underestimated Big Mom's capacity for betrayal, as he was unaware of her plans to double-cross him before the wedding is even concluded. Even though he put up a cautious defense when dealing with pirates, he nevertheless believed that even criminals such as them would have some honor in keeping with their deals, and became horrified when this view was betrayed. Judge has also exhibited great respect for strength, and the privileges that come with its exercise. He believes that men should speak with physical force alone, and flaunts his own power and accomplishments by hanging an image of himself victorious in the Conquest of Four Nations as interior decoration inside his castle. This view also colors his attitude towards his children, as he only values them when they prove such strength; for this reason, he refused to intervene as his other sons constantly and viciously bullied Sanji when they were all children. By contrast, he doted on all his other children, whose superhuman physical strength became obvious even as children. Even after 13 years of estrangement, after which Sanji returned to the Germa Kingdom with significantly improved physical strength that surprised even him, Judge still refused to acknowledge Sanji as his son. Judge is also extremely hypocritical. While he has emotions himself, he despises Sanji for his kindness and because he did not receive the same modifications as his brothers. While he refuses to privately acknowledge Sanji as a son, he openly acknowledges him in front of guests and allies in order to make himself look like a benevolent father and expresses rage that Sanji would dare to attack his father or sacrifice his family for his crew. When he was in a situation where his life was at stake, he was quick to act extremely cowardly, begging someone to save him while crying. Judge also believes that everyone should have some form of honor, but he has no qualms in using underhanded tactics such as blackmailing Sanji into an arranged marriage or lying to others to satisfy his own selfish agenda. While he claims he isn't inhuman enough to kill his own son, he has no problem in allowing others or Sanji himself to do it for him. In addition, Judge has proven that he is capable of immense cruelty. He was not simply content with demoralizing Sanji in front of his siblings, but further punished him by putting a metal mask over his face and locking him up in a dark cell within the family's castle. He also did nothing when his brothers were brutally bullying him and coldly told the latter he was not a son worth helping. After 13 years apart, his only reason for seeking Sanji out was to use him as a political pawn to further his goals and outright stated he views him as a means to an end. He even threatened the life of Zeff (the man who took Sanji in after Sanji left the family) and placed exploding wrist-cuffs on Sanji's hands (the things Sanji values the most), to ensure Sanji cooperated with the wedding. The only time he has shown an interest in Sanji's safety was in preventing Niji from attacking him, because he still needed Sanji to seal the political alliance. His cruelty is further shown in the anime. During the Conquest of the Four Nation, Judge completely disregarded the four defeated kings' pleas for mercy by kicking them before executing them ruthlessly. Despite his cruelty, however, Judge claims that he is not inhumane enough to kill his children, regardless of his feelings toward them. Despite considering Sanji as an utterly worthless son and a disgrace to the Vinsmoke Family, Judge chose to condemn his third son to life imprisonment instead of putting him to death. When Sanji decided to leave, Judge allowed Sanji to flee the Germa Kingdom, believing that Sanji would never survive on his own on the high seas. While Judge believes that the strong has the right to oppress the weak, he hypocritically shows great fear and despair when he is subjected to the short end of such treatment. When the Charlotte Family revealed Big Mom's plan to massacre his entire family and rendered them powerless with Charlotte Perospero's binding candy, Judge became horrified and sank into despair, weeping in the face of imminent doom and lamenting that his lifelong ambition of taking back North Blue would be beyond his reach. While crying, Judge was mocked by Ichiji, a child that he ensured would be strong and have no emotion, while also seeing Niji and Yonji simply accepting death without any resistance and even laughing about it. Seeing this flaw in their engineered apathy, Judge accusingly stated something is wrong with them, being unable to see that it was his own selfish actions that removed their capacity to feel emotions. Afterwards, he would be surprised when Sanji (the son he scorned for years) goes out of his way to save him from death, despite all the pain Judge put him through. When freed by Sanji, Judge was forced to comply with his third son's order to retreat, though he expressed annoyance at having to follow the latter's commands. Judge later questioned Sanji over his rescue of them despite his hatred for them. After explaining that he did not want to disappoint his father figure, Sanji then angrily disowned Judge as the latter looked at him in silence and finally recognized the depths of the pain that he put Sanji through. Somewhat humbled by Big Mom's betrayal and acknowledging the debt he owed Sanji, Judge solemnly promised to never interfere with Sanji's life nor threaten his mentor as he offered to fight off the Big Mom Pirates to give Sanji and his friends an opening to escape. When Judge confronted Big Mom, he showed some honor as he acknowledged his dream of retaking the North Blue was overreaching as he cursed Big Mom for deceiving him. To repay his debt with Sanji, Judge chose to aid the Straw Hat Pirates at Cacao Island rather than fleeing Totto Land. In the anime, Judge appears to be somewhat arrogant, believing he would be able to defeat Luffy and his crewmates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Judge has knowledge of Haki, as he recognized it when his son used it against him. In spite of his cowardly behavior at the thought of death, he seems to possess a strong enough will as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her screams. As king of the Germa Kingdom, Judge has authority over his subjects, and is a former attendee at Levely. Additionally, however, Judge seems to possess an unusual degree of power either within or over the World Government itself, as he can both influence the Marines' bounty process, and issue certain orders directly to them. However, during the events at Totto Land, he lost all the privileges from the Government itself due to his failed attempt at an alliance with Big Mom. Judge also has authority over Germa 66 as its supreme commander, giving him command of a very powerful military force. Judge once led his army in a conquest that vanquished four North Blue kings, further demonstrating his might. These positions and past actions have made Judge infamous throughout the Underworld. Once renowned as a brilliant scientist, Judge worked alongside Vegapunk in an illegal weapon research and development team over 21 years ago. Together with Vegapunk, Judge was able to discover the blueprints for the creation of life itself, attributed as the \"Lineage Factor\". A highly skilled geneticist, Judge has advanced knowledge of cloning and gene manipulation techniques, being able to conduct his research of the Lineage Factor by himself even after the World Government's capture of Vegapunk. His children and the soldiers of Germa 66 are among Judge's genetic experimentation achievements. His daughter and sons were genetically modified as children to have limitless physical potential (although due to Sora's interference, Sanji's modifications were neutralized), while his soldiers are artificially manufactured and programmed to be loyal and fearless. In the years after Sanji left the Germa Kingdom, Judge has further improved his genetic modification research that allow him to genetically enhanced humans after birth and superhumanly evolved their bodies at a much faster rate, a process which is contained in Sanji's Raid Suit and allowed him to quickly gained an Exoskeleton and superhuman constitution within a day after using the Raid Suit a second time, compared to his siblings which required years of training and developments to complete their growth as super soldiers. Aside from cell biology, Judge also has knowledge of military technology developed by the Germa Kingdom. He is able to expertly use his scientifically modified weaponry such as a spear for extreme offense and boots for enhanced agility and mobility. This allows him to fight evenly with Sanji. As the supreme commander of the infamous Germa 66, Judge has tremendous physical strength and extraordinary fighting skills, fighting evenly with his son Sanji, a powerful martial artist who has defeated powerful opponents such as Bentham, Jabra, Wadatsumi, and even Yonji, a genetically enhanced Germa commander. Despite his large physique, Judge has extremely sharp reflexes, able to keep up with Sanji's agility and defend against his fast kicks without much effort. He is capable of jumping extremely high, a feat he further enhances with jets affixed to the back of his boots, and his men in Germa 66 were awed to see his power on display. He has tremendous durability, as he was able to easily withstand Sanji's extremely powerful kicks that can shatter large boulders, steel, and even the incredibly hard body of a Pacifista, and could even grab hold one of Sanji's legs, which was enhanced by the intense heat of his improved Diable Jambe technique, without showing any signs of pain. Despite his physical prowess, Judge still reverted to using underhanded tactics to overpower his son. However, he has yet to demonstrate any of these capabilities without his raid suit. After the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treachery, Judge claimed that they would not be able to have their way with him if he had his raid suit. In spite of his skills, he was no match for Big Mom, who defeated him easily. Like the rest of the Vinsmoke Family, Judge has technologically advanced weapons at his disposal, such as a shape-memory and fireproof raid suit, equipped with boots able to produce a propulsive thrust making him jump upwards and emit electricity, a bulletproof cape, reinforced gloves and a spear, that he uses as his main weapon, which is capable of concentrating electricity inside it. The latter resisted Sanji's numerous kicks, but was later broken by a single punch from Big Mom. Judge has shown that he is capable of using Busoshoku Haki when he fought Caesar Clown, a Logia user and managing to wound him."},

While commanding the forces of Germa 66, he wears a dark blue raid suit, including a black cape bearing a blue \"2\", dark goggles over his eyes, gold-colored gauntlets, and an aqua ascot around his neck. A set of horns extend upwards from his pair of orange and red earphones, and his belt bears a buckle with a prominent lightning bolt design. Outside of his raid suit, Niji wears a light-colored buttoned shirt with a tie, as well as dark pants belted with a slimmer version of the belt he wears with his Germa gear. For formal functions, he also wears a dark floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp.

When chaos broke out, he changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Niji wore a light blue shirt with the number \"2\" on it, white pants, brown boots, a light blue bandana around his neck, and a pair of smaller goggles. His hair was styled in the same manner as it is in the present, although it was much shorter. In the anime, the bottom of his head was also shaved short as a child, creating an undercut style.", "personality": "Like most members of his family, Niji is proud of his royal status, looking down upon and even abusing commoners and servants. He also expresses disgust at his brother Sanji's displays of kindness towards such individuals. Accustomed to wealth and luxury, he does not see the importance of food as Sanji does, refusing to eat a plate of aligot for what he believes to be its unappetizing appearance, and planning to discard the food into the trash. Since birth, Niji has lacked the ability to feel empathy and sympathy due to the genetic modifications done by his father. He had no qualms about inflicting pain on servants, as shown when he attacked the head chef and even sarcastically stated that he would have avoided her face if he had known that Sanji cared for her. He is outspoken and quick to anger, as he was easily provoked by Sanji's insults, and voiced his irritation at seeing that Sanji had failed to greet him and Ichiji upon their return to the Germa Kingdom. He has also exhibited petty and vindictive behaviors, as he was willing to throw a plate at an innocent chef's face simply because Sanji defended her. Furthermore, Niji's emotional detachment is so strong that he was unmoved by even the prospect of his own death, as well as that of his family. After realizing they had been tricked, Niji remained calm, saying simply that they set their sights too high before laughing at their quandary. While on missions, Niji is serious and business-minded, making sure to collect Germa 66's commissions after performing their mercenary services. Unlike his sister Reiju, who displayed an interest in the philosophical issue of whether war or fractured peace was preferable, Niji dismissed her musings by stating that the Germa is only ever concerned with who was willing and able to pay them the most money. Despite his own cruelty, Niji did express slight disdain for Big Mom's habits of keeping humans trapped in books, showing that he does have some small degree of moral understanding. Like his brothers, Niji shares a lecherous streak, as he became lovestruck and drooled when he first saw Nami. Later, he expressed disappointment at the barmaids Big Mom had sent to them, and expressed a desire to negotiate for Nami's release into their custody. Despite his lecherous tendencies, however, he does have a certain degree of self-control. Unlike Yonji, he is able to overlook Charlotte Pudding's beauty and point out that marrying into the Charlotte Family would not bode well for them. Despite his arrogance and cruel nature, Niji does have a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude, as after Sanji saved his life, Niji wasted no time in repaying Sanji by saving some of his crewmates from being killed by the Big Mom Pirates, an act that strongly contradicts his engineered apathy. This is shown again when he showed concern for his sister when Big Mom targeted her and attempted to kill her. Niji even tried going back to save her before Ichiji told him to leave her behind. Niji also did not hesitate to rush to his father's aid after he was struck down by Big Mom. Later on, at Cacao Island, he personally escorted Sanji and Luffy to safety, narrowly saving his brother from being bombarded by a missile. While he saved his brother, he still called him a \"good-for nothing\" but in a joking manner. Niji has proven himself to be extremely cunning when the situation calls for it. He imitated Nusstorte's voice after he and his siblings defeated the army of Big Mom Pirates sent after them, and completely convinced Mont-d'Or that the Germa Kingdom had been crushed.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Germa Kingdom, Niji has political authority over its subjects, and great influence over the World Government. He also holds a high rank within Germa 66, possessing authority over common soldiers who will die for him on command. A portion of Germa 66, under Niji and Ichiji's command, was able to end a two-year war in four hours, thoroughly annihilating the side they were hired to fight. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Niji also has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. He seems to be proficient at impersonation, as he tricked Charlotte Mont-d'Or into thinking he was Charlotte Nusstorte when calling him from Nusstorte's Den Den Mushi. In the anime, the hand that was holding Nusstorte appears to be glowing. Niji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream. As a result of genetic enhancements, Niji possesses tremendous superhuman physical abilities. He has an outer skeleton that made him impervious to a blunt sword strike from Sanji, and one of Judge's aides said that he had developed the strength and agility of an adult man while he was a young child. One of his kicks generated enough wind force to knock a by-standing Cosette off her feet, despite Niji halting the kick in mid-air before it connected with Sanji. He was also able to throw Sanji and Luffy forward at a great speed, sending them flying through the sky over an entire fleet of the Big Mom Pirates' ships. He managed to lift Charlotte Nusstorte, an enormous man, with only one hand. Niji possesses a tremendous amount of speed and is capable of taking down his opponents extremely quick. He was able to move so fast that Sanji, a very skilled Kenbunshoku Haki user, lost sight of him, and managed to jump a great distance to pull Sanji away from the explosion of a nearby missile before it happened. He was also able to attack several Big Mom Pirates before they could react, even while holding Sanji and Luffy, and the power of his momentum allowed him to throw Sanji and Luffy over an entire fleet. He is also extremely durable, as he quickly fixed his broken jaw after taking a direct hit from Sanji's powerful kick and stood up to fight back almost immediately. He has a tremendous tolerance for alcohol, as he and his brothers continued to drink large quantities unaffected while the barmaids all fell intoxicated. Niji is highly proficient with a sword, overpowering Sanji several times in his youth. As an adult, he was shown combining his swordsmanship with his speed and Dengeki Blue ability to take out multiple Big Mom Pirates extremely quick. Niji possesses an ability that has given him the name Dengeki Blue. Similar to Electro, Niji can electrify parts of his body to deal heavy damage to his opponents, and was able to knock back Charlotte Oven with a single electrified kick, successfully rescuing Chopper from his grasp. He can also imbue other objects with electricity such as a sword. Due to his family's technological prowess, Niji possesses a raid suit which he wears in combat. It protects him from fire, bullets, and strong blows. It also provides him with jet-propelled boots."},
{"name": "Vinsmoke Ichiji", "episode": "Episode 828", "chapter": "Chapter 787", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 838. He first appeared as a fictional character in the Sora, Warrior of the Sea comic strip in Episode 783.", "appearance": "Ichiji has red-colored hair and curly eyebrows. Like all the Vinsmoke siblings, his distinctive curly eyebrows form a spiral that resemble the numeral 6. He is slim with long legs and stands at a comparable height to his brother Niji, being slightly taller. His hair is fashioned into three prominent cowlicks on the right side, and also curls upwards slightly at the roots, like his sister's. His right arm bears a prominent tattoo: the number \"1\" in the center of a stylized circle, surrounded by flames. When commanding the forces of Germa 66, he wears a dark red raid suit, including white gauntlets, a red ascot, a white cape (bearing a red \"1\" on its left), as well as a pair of sunglasses.Outside of his raid suit, Ichiji wears a dark shirt with an upturned collar and a light cravat, as well as a pair of light-colored pants.For formal functions, he also wears a floor-length, single-shoulder royal cape with an upturned collar and a neck clasp. However, unlike his siblings, his cape is light-colored. During the Tea Party, Ichiji changed into a white frilled dress shirt, as well as dark pants and gloves. He also wore a light-colored royal cape similar to the one he was wearing previously, but shorter and clasped together with two chains. In the anime his cape is dark red. After chaos broke out, he changed back into his raid suit. As a child, Ichiji did not wear glasses and he wore a red shirt with the number \"1\" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a dark magenta-reddish bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the same manner as it is in the present.", "personality": "Like most members of his family, Ichiji is proud of his royal status, looking down upon commoners and servants. Like his father, Niji, and Yonji, he expresses disgust at Sanji's displays of kindness towards such individuals, and labels him a \"disgrace\" to the family name. Despite being a prince of a highly imperialistic kingdom, however, Ichiji demonstrates little care for political affairs, and said so when his family discussed the mission on Broc Coli Island. Since birth, Ichiji has lacked the ability to feel empathy and sympathy, due to the genetic modifications performed on him by his father.He is cold and brutal to the people he fights, caring only about his task and not their lives. He expresses disdain for the people who oppose him, commenting that the four hours he spent fighting on Broc Coli Island had been a waste of effort. He also expects his subordinates in Germa 66 to lay down their lives for him at any point, showing no emotion at their deaths. Ichiji has also demonstrated that even the prospect of his own death is not enough to move him. After Big Mom revealed her treachery, Ichiji reacted with nonchalance, speaking only to reprimand his father's tears as pathetic. Ichiji is notably more hardened than Niji and Yonji as he was more focused on the mission. When Reiju was attacked by Big Mom, Ichiji simply dismissed Reiju as weak and told Niji to focus on their task to hold back the Big Mom Pirates. When his father was struck down by Big Mom, Ichiji did not bother to rush to Judge's aid, single-mindedly focused on escorting Bege and Caesar to safety as he attacked Katakuri. Unlike his more hot-headed younger brothers, Ichiji's usual manner is very calm and measured. However, when he is provoked, he reveals his capacity for extreme violence and brutality. During their childhood, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji all enjoyed tormenting Sanji because of his relative physical weakness and his interest in cooking, but Ichiji appeared to enjoy it the most. His behavior during these encounters also demonstrates his aloofness, as he preferred to let Niji and Yonji do most of the attacking while he watched. However, when Sanji tried to retaliate against Ichiji during an episode of bullying, Ichiji proved to be the most vicious of the brothers, beating Sanji almost senseless and warning his younger brother to never touch him again. When a despairing enemy soldier tried to shoot him during the war on Broc Coli Island, Ichiji told the man that he did not care about his dead family or his country before killing the soldier with his own gun. Additionally, like his sister Reiju, Ichiji prefers to watch events unfold without interfering, forming his own opinions and speaking up primarily to have the last word in a conversation. Despite his ruthlessness and engineered apathy, Ichiji has a strong sense of appreciation and gratitude. When Oven attempted to kill both Sanji and his captain, Ichiji wasted no time in saving his brother byassaulting Oven as repayment for saving his life during Big Mom's Tea Party. Like his younger brothers, Ichiji possesses a lecherous streak, as he became lovestruck when he first saw Nami. However, he is able to put his amorous tendencies aside and think rationally, as he reminds his brother Yonji that marrying into the Charlotte Family would require forfeiting their freedom after Yonji stated a desire to marry Charlotte Pudding himself.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Germa Kingdom, Ichiji has political authority over its subjects. He also holds a high ranking within Germa 66, giving him authority over common soldiers as well as the ability to order them to sacrifice themselves in his defense. A portion of Germa 66, under Ichiji and Niji's command, was able to end a two-year war in four hours, thoroughly annihilating the side they were hired to fight.After Judge was seriously wounded by Big Mom, Ichiji appeared to take command of the kingdom in his stead, ordering his siblings to move the ships out of Lake Aprico. As a member of the Vinsmoke Family, Ichiji has access to the advanced technology developed by his family as well as their extravagant wealth. Ichiji possesses a strong will, as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream. Along with the rest of his siblings, Ichiji was enhanced with genetic modifications that give him tremendous superhuman abilities. When Ichiji was a child, Judge's aide stated that his strength and agility was on the level of an adult man. He developed an outer skeleton that enhanced his durability; his face made a metallic noise when Sanji punched it, and the force of impact hurt Sanji's fist. Ichiji possesses immense physical strength. As a child, he was able to overpower and defeat an adult Germa soldier during a training regimen. By adulthood, he was able to grab the arm of an enemy soldier and twist it around so the soldier was pointing his gun at himself, keeping the gun stationary as he talked, although the enemy soldier was weakened from fighting. He has a tremendous tolerance for alcohol, as he and his brothers continued to drink large quantities unaffected while the barmaids all fell intoxicated. His physical durability is immense, and further enhanced by a fast recovery rate. Ichiji suffered injuriesfrom his loss toCharlotte Katakuri, but he later easily defeated Charlotte Nusstorte, Basskarte, and Dosmarche and their army alongside his siblings.Even after getting mowed down by a hail of candy-coated bullets, which could penetrate his normally invulnerable skin, he showed no emotion and continued to fight his opponents effectively. Ichiji is extremely proficient in hand to hand combat. While still a young boy, he could overpower an adult Germa soldier during training, which Judge's aide described as magnificent. By adulthood, he punched Charlotte Perospero with extreme speed and power. Ichiji possesses a tremendous amount of speed, as shown when he instantly appeared behind Charlotte Oven and his subordinates after using Sparking Red on them. Ichiji possesses an ability that has given him the name Sparking Red. He can release blasts of potent light energy from his hands and eyes which pierce through his opponents. He can also unleash this energy when he punches to deal explosive blows that are powerful enough to break Perospero's \"Candy Wall\", and to make the \"special Paramecia\" type Mochi Mochi no Mi user Charlotte Katakuri split in half. Due to his family's technological prowess, Ichiji possesses a raid suit which he wears in combat. It protects him from fire, bullets, and strong blows. It also provides him with jet-propelled boots."},

She wore different outfits depending on the situation: formal for performances, while casual for everyday events like doctor visits. After being resurrected as a zombie, Cindry retains her beautiful appearance, but now has various stitches across her body and pale blue skin. Her eyes appear flat and dull, and she no longer smiles, save for when she successfully resisted Hogback's orders for the first time. Her left leg has a web pattern across the inside of her thigh and the number 400 tattooed on her calf. She wears a short black evening gown and black high-heeled boots, with a red-orange fur boa wrapped around her neck.", "personality": "In life, despite her fame and popularity, Cindry was a compassionate woman who was kind to everyone. After she died, Cindry's corpse was implanted with a shadow, causing it to gain a different personality. As a zombie, Cindry despises plates and wishes all those existing in the world would vanish; her sheer hatred of plates will occasionally cause her to outright disobey Hogback's commands in order to destroy more of them. Her hatred for plates causes her to serve food without them, forcing Hogback and others to eat their food off of the table. On at least one occasion, she has even threatened to physically injure Hogback for saying Moria should have made her shadow forfeit its past memories so they would be able to eat on plates. She is described by Hogback as a depressing person whose violent words manage to horrify him every time. However, despite her rebellious nature, Cindry retains a zombie's obedience and will do whatever Hogback pleases as long as Gecko Moria orders her to, going as far as to accept his physical abuse and orders to lick the floor in a degrading manner. However, even as a zombie, Cindry's body retained some of her original \"will\" from when she was alive; this allowed her to make the choice to not only disobey Hogback's orders to rescue him, but to also smile like she had only done in life.", "abilities_and_powers": "While still alive, Cindry was a great actress and dancer. After obtaining her corpse, Hogback modified her body to increase her physical strength, allowing her to fight on equal grounds with Tony Tony Chopper's physically powerful humanoid form. As a zombie, she cannot feel pain. Since her implanted personality despises plates, Cindry uses them as projectile weapons; when attacking Usopp with them, Cindry displayed considerable marksmanship by hitting Usopp with ten plates in rapid succession from several meters away."},

It is unknown whether he believes in moral justice or absolute justice.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a marine officer, he has command over lower-ranking marines. Since he is a marine captain and a Devil Fruit user, it could be assumed that he is quite strong.

Though legends do have their inaccuracies, it was only clear that he was mad. He also had an interest in the Mermaid Princess of that era and her incredible ability to command the Sea Kings.", "abilities_and_powers": "Vander Decken was apparently powerful enough to throw his entire crew overboard.

{"name": "Van Augur", "episode": "Episode 222", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 234.", "appearance": "Augur is a rather thin man, with light brown hair that hangs down to his lower neck. He is extremely tall, standing at around the same height as Blackbeard, who is over 11 feet tall. He appears calm all the time, even in battles, and his typical expression is generally emotionless. His eyebrows are almost always furrowed in what looks like a saddened expression, and he rarely smiles. The left lens of the black glasses he wears is a normal, rectangular eyepiece, but the right side is circular and holds what appears to be a cross hair. He sports a large black hat, protruding out to both sides. Its shape bears an uncanny resemblance to an upturned boat's hull. Augur is constantly wearing a long black cape, under which he wears a button-up, pale lavender shirt with loose sleeves, and simple black pants, with a maroon belt with an aqua outline that goes over a small portion of his shirt. He also wears black shoes. Due to the size of his rifle Senriku, he carries it leaned against his shoulder. After the timeskip, Augur has grown a goatee.", "personality": "Augur is extremely calm and analytical even during battle. He very rarely changes his facial expression. However, in his confrontation with Ace on Banaro Island, he showed a darker side - showing a devilish grin after a failed kill shot. Like his crewmates, Augur is a heavy believer in fate. He displays very strong loyalty to Blackbeard and the rest of the crew. He has no qualms about ending the lives of some seagulls to assert his luck on whether they would die from his shots or not.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the sniper of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of its founding members, Augur is a powerful pirate. After the timeskip, he has become one of the Ten Titanic Captains of the crew that personally guard the Emperor Blackbeard, and has gained great authority in the crew as captain of its third Ship. Augur is shown to have great speed in shooting and running, as he did during his battle against Portgas D. Ace, by dodging their fire bullets. His powerful eyesight makes him a valuable asset as a scout for the crew, as he managed to spot Akainu on board an approaching Marine battleship. He also demonstrated superhuman stamina for his slim figure when he withstood one of Gura Gura no Mi of Whitebeard shockwaves (though not a direct hit) and Fleet Admiral Sengoku's shockwave with the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates, and recovered quickly. Augur ate the Wapu Wapu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to teleport himself and others from place to place. Augur is possibly one of the greatest master marksmen in the entire series. With his favorite rifle Senriku, Augur is able to fire bullets over tremendous distances with extraordinary accuracy. This is shown when Chopper suggested to Usopp that the seagulls flying around their ship were sniped from an extremely long distance, Nami immediately disclaims it since they could not see the island Augur was on, saying it was 'impossible' for any sniper to do. Augur was even able to tell after he shot the birds that one of them did not die immediately, showing his immensely sharp vision. Another example of his immense marksmanship skills (which is seen in the anime) is when he shot through the bullets of Impel Down's staff, and then through the barrels of their guns, destroying them. It was because of this that he was also able to discern Akainu being on board of the incoming battleship from afar. Augur uses a rifle called Senriku (, Senriku?, literally meaning \"Thousand Lands\") in battle. The rifle is extra-long in length, and allows extraordinary long-range shooting. Combined with his eyesight and immense marksmanship skills, this makes Senriku a lethal long-range weapon. However, he also used it for pointblank attack against Whitebeard."},
{"name": "Vegapunk", "episode": "Episode 684", "chapter": "Chapter 610", "year": 2012, "note": "He was first mentioned by Koby in Chapter 433.", "appearance": "Vegapunk is a relatively tall elderly man, standing just under Jinbe in height (without his brain), with slender limbs and red cheeks. He has a noticeably elongated but neatly sliced head and has a shaft driven in to support a structure resembling the top of an apple-core and its leaf. His forehead is remarkably wide, his tongue is very long, while his eyes are close to his potato nose. He has a bald head on top, but has spiky white hair on the sides, as well as a thick mustache. He wears a short white coat with SSG on the back, a pink shirt with red polka dots, purple pants, and purple DOM shoes. Before he cut out his brain, the size of his head had supposedly reached the height of Giants. When he was 43 years old, Vegapunk had an enlarged head accounting for much of his height, and his hair was dark and covered most of his head. He wore a leather jacket, a light shirt, a belt, dark pants, and dress shoes. When he was part of MADS, his head was much smaller with a bandage on the left side, his tongue was not sticking out, and lacked the mustache. He wore a Hawaiian shirt and goggles. During Kuma's explanation on his Pacifista modification, he seems to be wearing yellow gloves and a striped shirt with a white lab coat.", "personality": "In his youth, Vegapunk was a generous person who cared very much for the inhabitants of his island, willing to help them with his inventions. He is considered the island's pride and joy, and the residents are still hoping for his return. Each of Vegapunk's six satellites possesses a dominant personality trait that is presumably present in Vegapunk in general. While he has strong morals and a sense of justice and pride as a scientist (Shaka), he also possesses malevolent traits and an inclination to steal from others in order to fund his research (Lilith) and can be prone to greed (York); there is considerable conflict and reasoning between these two sides. He appears to be quite thoughtful and wise (Edison and Pythagoras) but can be prone to getting angry at other people's inability to properly replicate and utilize his technological developments, to the point of lashing out violently (Atlas). Unlike his former fellow scientist Caesar Clown, Vegapunk was far more moral about what he would do in pursuit of achievements. He refused to involve children in the gigantification process despite repeated failures. He also vetoed the creation or release of the H2S poison gas weapon for fear of it harming innocent people. Vegapunk also has a strongly idealistic and humanitarian side, proudly pronouncing his plans to use his future world-spanning inventions to help humanity and stop ongoing conflicts such as wars, even choosing to work for the World Government out of belief he could do more good for people by doing so. Unfortunately, certain people, like Jewelry Bonney, fail to see that side of Vegapunk as she was under the belief that he has no qualms with committing sacrifices and atrocities, personal or otherwise, in his air for greater knowledge and progress. He seems to have an interest for dragons, as he created two of them on Punk Hazard, and an artificial Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into one. However, he deemed the fruit a failure, but that was only due to the user's dragon form not being the same color as the dragon form bestowed by the real Devil Fruit it was based on. On that note, Vegapunk is a serious perfectionist; he was seen bawling on the ground after Luffy had informed him of how an artificial Devil Fruit, which he had made from Kaidou's lineage factor, had led its consumer to gaining the same Mythical Zoan abilities, albeit with a different color scheme. Given his nature as a scientist, Vegapunk has a natural interest in theories and the nature of science itself. He would elaborate on theories and concepts of science, even some others had brought up. When he heard that a certain scholar in the West Blue theorized that the human body loses 21 grams if they die, which was the weight of the soul, Vegapunk got so intrigued that he wanted to see it for himself, doing experiments on his thoughts and observing. His scientific interest would even go as far as that he would reach out to his close confidents, namely Bartholomew Kuma, to aid him in the experiments, knowing fully the full scope of the abilities he had but still wanted to find out if the theory could be proven and if similar things to the soul could be weighted as well, not letting go of his desire until he could run the experiments, not even refraining from begging until he could prove the theory and satisfy his scientific interest. In addition to his nature as a scientist and the benefits it brings, he also seems to be aware of the dangers and said nature a scientist has to bear as he was fully aware that his research, especially regarding the Ohara Incident and the Void Century, would make him a threat to the Government, calling it a scientist's nature to want to peek at answers knowing he had uncovered too much of the past to be kept alive. He even knew that CP0 was sent to assassinate him and prevent him from continuing his research. He also seems to be insistent on the importance of his words and science, as he was annoyed by Luffy's ignorance and disinterest in his work calling him out for his repeated disinterest. He appears to be honorable, as he granted Kuma his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Thousand Sunny until the Straw Hat Pirates return. Vegapunk takes his survival seriously and will not hesitate to ask for help when necessary. He requested Luffy to get him off Egghead and away from the World Government when they moved to assassinate him, despite just meeting the young Emperor. He does not mind dragging others allies into helping him without considering their circumstances first. He has a verbal tic in which he adds \"Quasar\" (, Kus?) to his requests for help.", "abilities_and_powers": "While it is unclear when Vegapunk started using his satellites to split his workload, he himself is famed as the greatest scientific genius the world has ever known, having tremendous knowledge and unmatched understanding in all fields of science, from cell biology to military technology, at the beginning of his work on Karakuri Island as noted by Franky. His scientific expertise is said to be at least 500 years ahead of his contemporaries. It seems that even in his youth, the scientist was a prodigy already considered a genius, but lacked the skills, funds, and materials to develop his inventions, although that did not stop him from theorizing the creation of Pacifista cyborgs, including their laser weapons back then. This is proven by the fact that Franky was able to recreate the technologies by self-studying the blueprints Vegapunk left behind on his home island. Regardless, the creations and blueprints that he has left behind are considered invaluable, and any damage inflicted to them is considered a crime. He has read and fully memorized every single book that had been rescued from Ohara. Vegapunk has a deep knowledge and understand of Devil Fruits, having studied many old texts about them. He is the only known person beside The Five Elders to realize the true nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit after witnessing his awakened form. He discovered exactly how Devil Fruit powers are transferred over to a user, and he was also the scientist behind the method of adding Devil Fruit powers into inanimate objects, such as swords and guns. By using this method, he was able to create a unique blood for his latest creation, the Seraphim, by extracting the Lineage Factor of a Paramecia User, synthesizing it, creating the so-called \"Green Blood\". He even went as far as having developed a theory about how Devil Fruits came into existence from his knowledge, theorizing that Devil Fruits are the embodiment of what humans desire and could become, which is also the reason why the sea, which he calls \"the mother of nature\" rejects any Devil Fruit user and makes them unable to swim, as such behavior is loathed by the sea and it considers these wishes to transcend the world people wish to live in as \"abnormalities\". Vegapunk is an extraordinary surgeon. He is the one who modified Bartholomew Kuma into a cyborg, and he has produced many Pacifista replicas of him as well, granting them some of the abilities of Kizaru's Devil Fruit in the process. These replicas bleed actual blood, like Kuma himself. However, they lack Kuma's own Devil Fruit abilities. After the two-year timeskip, Sentomaru revealed that the latest Pacifista had been further modified; these were later revealed to be the Seraphim, replicas of the Seven Warlords of the Sea in their youth, albeit with Lunarian traits. Perhaps Vegapunk greatest medical feat is removing his own giant head and part of his brain without killing himself. The lasers that are installed into the Pacifista were apparently supposed to be so advanced, that only Vegapunk knew how to create them. It was also stated that the dragons found on Punk Hazard were Vegapunk's own creations. He was able to survive the explosion of Caesar Clown's mass murder weapon. It is unknown whether his \"Stella\" body was present and was sturdy enough to survive the explosion, or one of his Satellite bodies was present in his stead. Via his research, he discovered ways of allowing Marine ships to pass through the Calm Belts without fear of a Sea King attack, by covering the bottom of the ships with Seastone. Vegapunk ate the Nomi Nomi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows his brain to store an indefinite amount of information and recall everything he has ever learned. It also causes his brain and head to expand continuously as he acquires new knowledge. Due to splitting himself up into six people, Vegapunk is now able to be many times more productive as his satellites are capable of working independently at the same time. The fact that each of his satellites can also be equipped with weapons, vehicles, and technology also makes Vegapunk drastically more difficult to handle in combat. The satellites are capable of communicating with each other via an earpiece and may also share senses as Shaka was able to see what was around Lilith while the two of them were in different locations. Necessary bodily functions can be assigned to one satellite, allowing the others to forgo them. Currently, York is tasked with eating, sleeping, urinating, and defecating on behalf of the rest of the satellites. The following is a list of the research projects done under the name Vegapunk, and it is unknown for some of them whether it was Vegapunk himself or one of the satellites that is responsible for them."},
{"name": "Vander Decken IX", "episode": "Episode 606", "chapter": "Chapter 525", "year": 2010, "note": "His full name was revealed by Pappag in Chapter 610. He is formally introduced in Chapter 613.", "appearance": "Decken is a tall individual with beige-colored skin (mid-dark brown in manga), slim build, and lanky limbs. His most distinguishing feature is his four legs. He has a short, scraggly goatee, a long, wavy mustache with spiky edges, and similarly, long, wavy and spiky black hair. After being rejected by Shirahoshi, he shaves the top of his head in depression. He also has sharp teeth, with bigger webs between his fingers than most fish-men, a very thin, pointy nose and a prominent hunch that puts his head on equal level with his shoulders. He wears three golden bands on each of his ankles, and two pairs of sandals. He sports green overalls reaching just below his knees, with ruffled edges and decorative buttons on both the straps, over a light green-colored (white in the anime) shirt with ruffled edges. He sports a yellow cape, also complete with ruffled edges, draped over his shoulders, and two massive beaded necklaces hanging on his chest. He wears a yellow fedora with a purple band on his head which he seems to have had for at least ten years. In order to maintain his power's lock onto Princess Shirahoshi, he wore a red glove on his right hand at most times. While masquerading as his supposed cursed ancestor during his first appearance, he wore a dark colored cloak that covered up his body. In the past, he wore a broadly horizontal-striped shirt under light overalls with a gun strapped to his hip. He had cat-like whiskers instead of a mustache and did not have a goatee. His hair was shorter and was straight and rounded like dreadlocks.", "personality": "Decken often has his arms crossed over his chest with each of his hands holding two fingers in a 'victory' sign. He is very formal, as shown when he introduced himself to Hody Jones. He often adds \"I think\" (, no hazuda?) to the end of his sentences (the word \"think\" is changed to \"suspect\" in the English Dub). He also does not want to become a subordinate to anyone which is the reason why he did not join the Arlong Pirates, but is willing to get into a partnership with anyone who shares a similar goal with him, as long as he is treated as no less than an equal. He seems to be somewhat of a poet, reciting a haiku after Shirahoshi rejected him. He was also reciting a poem when the Straw Hats first encountered him. Decken is completely obsessed with Princess Shirahoshi, which leads him to act without thinking straight and usually acts one step ahead of the situation, such as writing wedding invitations before even proposing or realizing that he has no friends to invite, or calling Neptune \"father\" before the wedding that Neptune disapproves of anyways. He is also a madman when it comes to Shirahoshi, as he is willing to go to extreme measures such as throwing Noah just to kill one person. However, unlike many fish-men and despite joining forces with the New Fish-Men Pirates, Decken himself never showed interest about any sympathy for or against the centuries of prejudice against humanity and it's just centered to marry the mermaid princess and achieving the purpose of his ancestors. He has been described as a bandit of the sea floor, and the residents of Fish-Man Island feared him for years. Typical of a pirate, he believes violence is the answer for everything, which is most evident by how he displays his affection for Shirahoshi by throwing large weapons at her. He has a desire for treasure as he does not approve of his giant anglerfish, Ankoro, eating ships before he can collect the ships' treasure. In the anime, Decken is quite arrogant, believing Jinbe to be weaker than him despite his Warlord status. He tends to overreact to certain situations that surprise him, such as reacting shocked and depressed when Shirahoshi turned him down for \"not being her type\" and decided to cry endlessly, recite a haiku, and shave the top of his head in depression. This was shown again when she rejected him a second time despite her life being on the line at the time and when her brothers showed up. This makes him one of the more comedic villains shown (like Buggy or Spandam). Like many characters in the series, Decken has a distinct laugh, starting his with \"Ba\" (i.e Bahohohoho!).", "abilities_and_powers": "Vander Decken IX is the eighth descendant of the legendary wicked pirate Vander Decken and the captain of the Flying Pirates: as such, he has authority over his crew and controls the legendary, enormous ship Flying Dutchman. He also has at least two gigantic sea creatures at his command, these being the fish-man Wadatsumi and the giant anglerfish Ankoro. When Decken joined forces with Hody Jones, it was stated that these two pirate captains working together would be unstoppable, although their relationship was fragile, which hampered, and ultimately broke off, their alliance. As a fish-man, Decken is physically ten times stronger than a common human, which allowed him to carry and throw a battle axe that is larger than himself. With a single kick, he easily broke a giant coral. By dual wielding two axes, Decken easily defeated multiple fish-men when they attempted to stop him from going after Shirahoshi. He also seems to hold a great deal of endurance, as he was able to recover just moments after Luffy pummeled him into the ground with a Jet Hammer attack. He was also able to survive getting stabbed by Hody's trident, slashed by his own axe, and falling from considerable heights. He was also capable of surviving Luffy's assault on Noah despite being hit by the attack. However, it is shown that he has limits, as he was knocked out just by hitting his head on a step after slipping. Decken ate the Mato Mato no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to mark someone as his target by touching them with his bare hand so that any weapon he throws with that same hand will \"lock on\" to and chase after the target until it hits them, or until it is stopped by an obstacle. The object doesnt have to be a weapon, the projectile can be any kind of object, including living people. He also doesnt necessarily have to throw the object in order for it to fly at his target, but merely touch it with the hand that he used to mark his target, as demonstrated when he touches the gigantic ship, Noah to send it flying towards Shirahoshi. If Decken dies or falls unconscious, the effects of his ability will be nullified. He can use his power as a means of locating one of his targets and can even ride on some of the objects he throws, as shown when he threw and jumped on a large piece of coral to find Shirahoshi. Also, as a Devil Fruit user, he is powerless in the sea, as he requires a flutter kick coating. The loss of the ability to swim affects Decken more than a human Devil Fruit user, since, as a fish-man, he would have a huge advantage underwater, an advantage he can no longer use due to the side-effects. But he can still survive underwater, even if he cant move. Despite not being visible anywhere on his body, Decken has a great array of weapons at his disposal, which have mostly been seen used in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers. He seems to have a penchant for large battle-axes with a rose design on the sides and knives. He throws giant double-bladed ones at Shirahoshi from afar during several occasions, and tried to kill her with single-edged smaller (but still rather large) ones, which he also employed proficiently in melee when fending off some inhabitants of Ryugu Kingdom who were trying to stop him. However, judging from the exterior of the Hard-Shell Tower he has a large variety, including swords and maces. He also has knives installed in his front sandals, so he can raise his front legs to fight with them while being supported by his hind legs. Aside from the large amount of weapons he currently carries on his body, he has other weapons alongside him. Ten years prior to his introduction, he was seen carrying a rifle on a hip holster. In the New Fish-Man Pirates' hideout, after making Hatchan his target, he showed off his Devil Fruit powers by hitting the fish-man with a thrown knife and then threw a volley of arrows at Hatchan, forcing him to flee."},
{"name": "Vergo", "episode": "Episode 671", "chapter": "Chapter 597", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 672.", "appearance": "Vergo was a tall, light-skinned, lean, yet muscular man with short dark hair, a beard, sideburns, and sunglasses. From his sideburns on, his facial hair grew horizontally. On his cheek it grew downwards with a pointed end. Vergo wore a white knee-length trench coat that had a quilted design which stopped just below his waist (where the coat then had a plain design), along with two black pockets slightly above the chest on either side. Under the coat he wore a mauve-colored shirt with a purple-colored ascot embedded with a red jewel, with a golden-yellow outline at the top in the tie. He also wore black-colored gloves. As Vergo was a messy eater, he tended to have pieces of food stuck to his face from time to time, such as French fries when residents of a certain island had a flashback of him, and a partially eaten hamburger patty stuck to his left cheek when he was first introduced. However, once pointed out by Monet, Vergo then proceeded to finish eating the piece of food stuck to his cheek. This also extends to eating utensils- a stirring spoon from a coffee cup got stuck to his face and it stayed on his face for a long time, as it was still stuck when he talked with Caesar following the spread of Shinokuni, and when he proceeded to eliminate G-5. After being interrupted by a kick from Sanji, however, the spoon was knocked loose from his face. When he was younger, his relative features seem to be the same but is seen with a bowl haircut and lacking a full beard. During his time as a vice admiral of G-5, Vergo wore a Marine coat over his current attire.", "personality": "Through his short confrontation with Trafalgar Law, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man. He could also come across as patronizing, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the Warlord. Seeing himself as above the Warlord, Vergo quickly reminded Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He was also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-san. While around citizens, Vergo was cited to be an amiable, personable and approachable person in comparison to the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in accidents at sea. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believed that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marine bureaucracy, Vergo had proven himself to be highly manipulative and insidious. His true identity being a secret to most, he could become very cruel and ruthless once he revealed his true disposition, and would murder his own Marine subordinates without so much as a moment of hesitation or explanation. Being their leader also made him believe that anything he does to them is his right, believing they are nothing but rejects. His cruelty was reflected in his fighting style, as he often brutally beat his victims into submission. He also offered to cut one of Law's ears off and send it to Doflamingoas proof that he killed him. Contrary to his G-5 subordinates, he is very loyal to the Donquixote Family, respecting his comrades as family, though he showed extreme brutality when it comes to dealing with traitors, as he violently beat and scolded Rosinante for his treason; similarly, he does not hesitate in using similar violence against disrespectful juniors. Despite his perceived intelligence, however, Vergo sometimes seemed to lapse into moments of witlessness such as when he claimed to Caesar that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly thereafter that there had never been any cookies to begin with. Another example is when he was about to go after Smoker and Law, he could not remember where he placed his sword, only for Monet to remind him that he is not a swordsman. Even Doflamingo is aware of this, as when Vergo claimed to have purchased a camera only to be reminded that he did not buy one at all. In fact, he did not even notice there was a large piece of patty (or any other food and utensils) on his cheek until he was made to notice it. This habit was even around when he was ten years old, as a large, partly-eaten loaf of french bread was stuck on his cheek.", "abilities_and_powers": "Vergo was a powerful man who was confident in his superiority to an opponent like Trafalgar Law, who was strong enough to become a Warlord. This was proven by Vergo's two easy victories over Law, although the fact that he had Law's heart, which he used to weaken him, should be taken into consideration. Regardless, Doflamingo had enough confidence in Vergo's abilities to assign him to dispose of Law. Vergo's mere presence was enough to scare off one of Punk Hazard's extremely fierce dragons. He completely overwhelmed Unit 01 of G-5, including Tashigi(minus Smoker at the time), despite their superior numbers. Vergo defeated Vice Admiral Smoker with moderate difficulty (while still holding back his full strength). It can be seen that Smoker already knew that he could not defeat Vergo, so he decided to concentrate on retrieving Law's heart.. Even when he was a 10-year-old, Vergo was strong enough to burn down an entire city alongside Trebol, Diamante and Pica, all of whom were children. He also possessed considerable knowledgeable of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki have the qualities of a king. As a former vice admiral and the former head of G-5, he had command over his lower ranking subordinates, as well as control over the entire base. He was also skillful enough to deceive the entirety of the Marines, including the former fleet admiral, Sengoku, and the observant Smoker, in hiding his true affiliations, as well as deceiving citizens with pretexts by falsifying the crimes into \"accidents at sea\". Even after abdicating the position of Corazon, he remained an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates until his death, meaning he had command over the two thousand soldiers and eleven officers of his pirate crew; his command was equal to Trebol, Diamante and Pica, and just underneath Doflamingo himself. Vergo had an extremely high level of physical durability, endurance, and resilience; he shook off a Diable Jambe-enhanced kick from Sanji to the face (although the attack did cause him to spit out blood), which sent him through a metal wall, followed by an additional barrage of kicks, with few wounds. Law's Counter Shock, an attack strong enough to knock a giant unconscious, barely fazed him. On Minion Island, Vergo stayed in a snowy environment without any signs of feeling cold, as he threw off his uniform and then had it draped over his shoulders open after violently beating Rosinante and Law. He possessed immense physical strength, as he could fracture a bone in Sanji's leg with one kick. In the anime, he was shown defeating adults even at the age of 10. Vergo was also remarkably fast, as he could easily keep up with Sanji's agility and when Law used his ROOM to retrieve his heart, Vergo immediately appeared in front of him and sent him crashing into a railing with a kick. Vergo was also an extremely skilled master of unarmed combat. He completely overpowered the expert swordswoman Tashigi and easily fought against Sanji, a powerful master of the Black Leg Style, matching him blow for blow. Like several other high-ranking Marines, Vergo had access to the Rokushiki martial arts style. Using Shigan, he swiftly stabbed multiple G-5 Marines at Punk Hazard. He also usedGeppo to escape from H2S gas and travel through a hallway,and Soru to stop Trafalgar Law from retrieving his heart.Vergo's mastery of Tekkai was at an extremely advanced level, causing Sanji to wonder if he was made of metal, as he easily withstood Sanji's Diable Jambe-enhanced kicks, which were powerful enough to burn through Jabra's Tekkai prior to Sanji's two years of training, and had become strong enough to destroy the stronger-than-steel body of a Pacifista. It was stated by Doctor Fishbonen that all vice admirals possess Haki, so as a vice admiral, Vergo could also use the ability. Even as a cadet in the Marines, he was an exceptionally skilled Haki user. Vergo was an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, having mastered hardening and imbuement, hardening himself and his bamboo stick, attacking opponents with great offensive power. If applied onto his limbs, he could brutalize Law with his hardened fist(s) and elbow(s), and blocking Tashigi's Meito, Shigure with a hardened arm. Vergo has attested that his Busoshoku Haki was far superior to Smoker's, as proven when he broke his hardened Nanashaku Jitte using his bamboo stick, severely wounding Smoker at the same time. Caesar Clown and Donquixote Doflamingo have both vouched that his mastery of Busoshoku Haki was not something that an average opponent could handle. He, in particular, is noted as being skilled enough to harden his entire body with it even 13 years prior, drastically improving his offensive and defensive capabilities, having dealt severe blows to Rosinante and Law. According to Doflamingo, it protected Vergo from even Law's spatial cutting power, which is supposedly able to cut through anything. However, the Warlord did not count on the fact that the Supernova has improved his power dramatically since the last time the two fought and over the two-year timeskip. Vergo possessed the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. During his time as a cadet, he carried a rifle on his back. Vergo's main weapon was a long bamboo stick, which was most likely the source of his epithet, \"Demon Bamboo\", and he frequently used it in tandem with his Busoshoku Haki.It also doubled as a blowgun, which could shoot bamboo arrows (in the anime, bullets) that created large explosions. When Vergo used this attack, the stick became enlarged but it did not break. In the anime, this technique was depicted with the bamboo making a horn-like sound."},
{"name": "Vasco Shot", "episode": "Episode 575", "chapter": "Chapter 484", "year": 2010, "note": "He was first mentioned by Emporio Ivankov in Chapter 538.", "appearance": "Vasco Shot is a huge man, three times a normal man's height; of the Blackbeard Pirates' core members, his size is second only to Sanjuan Wolf's. He is stocky, overly top-heavy in build with thick arms, proportionate to his torso, that reach knee level, looking massive compared to his disproportionally shorter, thinner legs. Shot has light skin with a red undertone, an extremely wide neck, and on top an unattractive face that is set most apart by his big, bulbous nose: uniform in its thickness, protruding down over his mouth and slightly frontward, with small, nearly unseen nose wings and a strange placement: its bridge starting higher than Shot's eyes are set. The latter are widely spaced beside his nose, drooping, with purplish-gray irises underlined by black lines (more prominent in the manga) that jut upward from the outer eye corners like lashes, and being topped by what seem to be thin, short brows always drawn downward, touching the nose's upper edge. Otherwise, Shot is seen with a perpetual, drunken smile, his mouth gaping wide, exposing his big, rounded teeth, with his tongue sticking out, salivating, thickening the apples of his cheeks (marked by blush marks), and forming prominent chin folds. His tall, rounded forehead is furrowed, with a black jester's hat above whose two cones bend over, and are tipped by white pompoms. Behind, his black, waved hair comes out to go down his back, and placed upon the sides of his neck (three on each) are large, golden ring piercings. True to his moniker, Shot is always seen chugging on a large, yellowish gourd of liquor strapped on his back by a rope, which has the kanji \"sake\" (?) on its bottom section. Clothes-wise, beside his hat, he has only been seen donning the basic Impel Down prison uniform, comprising a long-sleeved shirt and shorts striped black-and-white, plus white slip-on shoes. Midway through the Egghead Arc, Shot's design changed from his previous appearance at Amazon Lily. He now wears dark lipstick and has a small star tattoo on the left-side of his forehead, as well as a darkened nose. His outfit now consists of a black feathered coat, worn over diamond-patterned overalls.", "personality": "As his epithet suggests, Shot's general bearing is that of a nonchalant, somewhat dopey drunk; having yet to be seen in a sober state, how strongly inebriation affects his personality is unknown. He does seem to hate the idea of sobering up, as he at one point suggested to his crew that they invade a town somewhere solely because he had run out of booze. However, Shot's apparent goofiness seems to bely his viciousness, which is established by the supposed cruelty of his crimes that led to his bygone imprisonment; said to be of outstanding brutality even by the standards of Impel Down's Level 6 prisoners, and as a result of which his very existence had to be erased from history. Upon his crew's arrival at the Summit War of Marineford, Shot was seen asking for permission to kill everyone present at the scene, suggesting a lust for battle. Vasco Shot has displayed a lecherous nature such as when he tried to dissuade Devon from killing Boa Hancock, suggesting that they could have fun with her if they took her away. He also felt enough lust towards Boa Hancock to be affected by her Devil Fruit ability. Shot, like many characters, has a signature laughter style: \"Toputoputopu\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "Over the two-year timeskip, Shot has become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" who personally guard the Emperor, acquiring great authority in the crew as captain of its eighth ship. Next to nothing is yet known about what Shot is capable of in combat. However, he is strong enough to have been contained in Level 6 of Impel Down where only the world's worst, most dangerous criminals are held, where Emporio Ivankov considers him very notorious. This is checked, as when Blackbeard recruited him alongside other prisoners, he chose only those who could survive when pitted against all other Level 6 prisoners in a free-for-all battle royale. Shot is shown to have impressive endurance, displayed when he took a quake shockwave from Whitebeard (albeit launched from afar rather than a direct hit) and thereafter one of the energy shockwaves from Sengoku's Daibutsu Form, and seemingly recovered swiftly each time. Shot ate the Gabu Gabu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit with alcohol-based powers. He has demonstrated the ability to take advantage of alcohol's flammable properties and attack with fire, but beyond that, the full capabilities of his powers are currently unknown. Shot was seen wielding dual pistols while he participated in the killing of Whitebeard. In the manga only one gun is seen."},

He wore a long bead necklace which reached down to his chest, as well as a kimono and long cape.", "personality": "Like his fellow daimyo Shimotsuki Ushimaru and Fugetsu Omusubi who were imprisoned with him, Tempura was a very honorable warrior. He refused to battle over food due to hunger, being more than willing to give it to Kaidou's son Yamato.

However, they ultimately proved to be no match for Kaidou, losing to him and his forces on two occasions and dying in the second battle.

{"name": "Usopp", "episode": "Episode 23", "chapter": "Chapter 8", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "Usopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly hair, prominent lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion to Pinocchio (a wooden boy from a story of the same name who possessed a nose that would stretch after he lied). Usopp inherited his famous nose from his mother, while the rest of his face closely resembles his father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in the Boin Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating. Like the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the majority of the series before wearing different clothing by the end of the Paradise. Usopp usually wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue and white striped armband on his left arm, along with special sniper goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular goggles that he sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his sniper goggles were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash and no shirt underneath. He also carries with him a yellow satchel, which he stores all his tools and gadgets in. During the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown jumper with white fur collar and cuffs, faded yellow gloves and grey pants with a black \"c\" pattern. During the walk through the desert in the Arabasta Arc, he wore a brown keffiyeh under his goggles and a dull red (blue in Volume 19 cover, and dull green in the anime) and black striped desert cloak. During the Skypiea Arc, he wore a murky green shirt underneath brown overalls and some bandages on his torso and arms after getting attacked by Enel. During the final game of the Davy Back Fight, he wore a yellow zip-up coach jacket, a red towel around his shoulders, and silver sunglasses with purple lenses. Usopp was also trusted with Luffy's straw hat which he wore on his head. During the Water 7 Arc, he wore bandages under his overalls again after being attacked by the Franky Family. While onboard the Puffing Tom he put on a gold colored sun-like mask he found in a compartment over his goggles and wore a red cape, calling this superhero persona \"Sogeking\". Usopp wore this costume for the rest of the Enies Lobby Arc. During the Thriller Bark Arc Usopp wore a purple cape and a wide brim purple hat with a necklace of garlic to ward off evil creatures. During Sabaody Archipelago Arc Usopp wore an unbuttoned turquoise shirt instead of his overalls and some green shorts with a yellow flower pattern on one leg. After the two year timeskip, Usopp has become much more muscular than before and has grown his hair out. He has become \"manlier\" and is slightly taller than before. Usopp now has a new pair of goggles around his neck (his sniper goggles weren't shown) and has some headphones or ear protectors on. He also now has a little goatee along with a new white sun cap he wears on his head. He also has a new pair of rolled-up yellow pants with red suspenders and a pair of boots. His trademark yellow satchel has been replaced with a red one, but he still has his blue and white striped wristband on his left arm. During the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a purple coat with light blue lining on the sides, which he took from one of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit. During the Dressrosa Arc, he wore an orange open jacket with a ring of circles on the arms and a red cap which has a pointy stub on the end, which he used to make the Dwarves believe he was a descendant of Noland. During the Zou Arc, he wore a light green short-sleeved collared shirt buttoned up halfway with a short, black line on the middle of each sleeve and a dark green cap with his signature goggles resting on top of it. In the Wano Country Arc, Usopp wears a light blue yukata underneath a pair of black and white striped hakama, as well as a green bandanna adorned with a frog and fake old man beard. During the raid on Onigashima, Usopp wears his usual yellow pants, blue and white striped wristband, satchel, and headphones, however instead of suspenders, Usopp decides to wear a dark multi-colored armor plate with brown gloves and red protective head gear. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, he wore a Beasts Pirates disguise, adding his googles as a part of the disguise. During the Egghead Arc, Usopp wears a light full-body jumpsuit and a dark jacket with matching gloves and bandanna, and an earpiece with a antenna on it. He also wears a pair of dark sunglasses, a dark leg strap and a pair of DOM Shoes. In the Movie 2, he initially appears with a red and white striped swimwear. After the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a brown kimono and a black hat from a wedding store. Then he changes his clothes for an orange jacket and dark green pants, returning to wear his usual bandanna. In the Movie 3, he wears overalls with camouflage print, his white sash at the waist. He also wears his orange glasses during the plot. Also momentarily, he wears an extravagant lion costume designed by himself. During the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates as a Marine soldier, wearing a Marine uniform and cap."},
{"name": "Uta", "episode": "Episode 1055", "chapter": "Chapter 1029", "year": 2022, "note": "", "appearance": "Uta is a young woman of medium height with long hair that is white on her left side and red on her right; the colors are perfectly separated at the middle of her scalp. Her hair is arranged into two long ponytails with two circular braids at the end; these circular braids are also seen at the top of her head. Her left eye is shrouded by her white hair. Sometimes, she is seen with a pair of feathery wings on her back, the right one pink and the left one white. Her left eye is shown to be bright purple. She wears a short white dress ending at her upper thighs; the dress possesses a frilly neckline and a black bow and buttons down the middle. On her left arm, she wears a light blue sleeve that covers the entire arm with Luffy's childhood drawing of Shanks' \"straw hat\". Additionally, she wears a set of golden cone-shaped headphones with light-blue bands over her ears. She was also shown wearing a multi-colored jacket with numerous designs scattered on it.", "personality": "For the most part, Uta seems to be cheerful and optimistic. She possesses a strong ideal to build a new era of peace and happiness through her voice, even if it means people would be forced to live forever in the Uta World. She is shown to be highly empathetic, as seen feeling righteous anger for a fan that wrote her a letter after losing loved ones. She holds great value to the opinion of her fans, doubting her plans temporarily after some of her fans opposed her actions, though she evidently holds her own ideals above them, as she turns her fans into objects to stop them from speaking their minds. She also hates pirates, due to how much they destroy the lives of her fans and due to her father and his crew abandoning her. However, she is also highly ignorant of pirates in general, as seen in Uta Diary #4, where she discovered posters of Donquixote Doflamingo and Charlotte Linlin, and was completely unaware that they were a part of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Four Emperors respectively, instead commenting on their fashion and the photo itself. After her plans for New Genesis fail, she admits there are pirates who are worthy of respect, as she regains her admiration for her father's crew and confides in Luffy's dream to usher a new world by becoming the Pirate King. Due to her traumatic past, her isolation in Elegia, and the continuous consumption of wake-shrooms, which causes the consumer to slowly lose control of their emotion, Uta became mentally unstable at times when her plans and ideals was met with resistance, causing her to have episodes where she would act erratic, ruthless, and borderline cruel to those around her, regardless whether they were her enemies or fans, as she was quick to abandon and try to kill Luffy when he refused to go along with her plans. This also made her incapable of reason or negotiation by anyone, and she would ignore the pleas and warnings of others as she had planned to use Tot Musica as a last resort despite the warnings of destruction it would cause. Her reunion with Shanks would cause her to descend to complete madness to the point she would perform the ritual. As a child, Uta acted like a stereotypical diva, being infatuated with jewelry and glamour and not liking to get dirty. She could be overbearing and mean, particularly to other children like Luffy, and though she liked to throw out insults she would cry if her victim insulted her back. She looked down on some of the wilder, more boorish behaviors of her father and his crew, but was still proud of being a member of the Red Hair Pirates.", "abilities_and_powers": "Uta's singing voice has been appraised as \"otherwordly\" (, betsu jigen?), enough to grant her the title of the world's greatest diva. Aside from her singing talents, Uta is also great at music theory, showing amazing skill as a lyricist and composer by having written her most famous songs herself. In terms of physical prowess, Uta has not displayed any superior abilities outside of being a talented and dexterous dancer, fully relying on her Devil Fruit ability to compensate. In fact, when Luffy fought her, he never actually directly attacked her body, knowing that he could potentially kill her if he did. She also does not have a lot of stamina, since usually she would fall asleep after only a few songs. In the movie, she counteracted this weakness by continuously consuming Wake-shrooms in order to last for hours. Uta ate the Uta Uta no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transport people's consciousnesses to a virtual space called \"Uta World\" by singing. Within Uta World, she is essentially all-powerful and able to do whatever she wants until she runs out of energy. Tot Musica is a Demon Lord sealed under Elegia by a previous user of the Uta Uta no Mi. Uta can use her Devil Fruit ability to unseal it and have it fight for her. Arguably Uta's greatest weapon is her overwhelming charisma, which gained her worldwide popularity via her livestream performances. Robin had stated that she was the world's most beloved person, with Brook, a highly popular rockstar, claiming inferiority compared to her. Indeed, when she enacted her plan to pull people into Uta World, she managed to ensnare approximately 70% of the entire world's population. Also, while in Uta World, she commanded her entire audience in a pirate hunt, with the majority going along with her. She is seen wielding a spear and a shield and also used a jetpack that enables her to fly, though this was all in the Uta World. In the real world she had a knife, though never had the opportunity to use it."},

He has long, pink-colored hair that he wore in a topknot with a braid on each side of his face, and he has a slight widow's peak. The topknot has been cut off by Kiku during his attempt to capture her. His two forearms are covered with indigo tattoos, and the left tattoo goes down to his hip. When not in a sumo match, Urashima wears a large, light green-colored samurai gi that has a flower emblem on the sleeves and a square pattern on the rest. He also wears geta sandals on his disproportionately small feet, and he has two katanas which he wears on his left hip. During his meeting with Mouseman, he wears a kimono with white and blue squares. He wears a dark purple mawashi when he's sumo wrestling.", "personality": "Urashima is very full of himself due to his high social status, and perceives that he has the authority to do whatever he wants to lower-class people, whom he views with great disdain. Unless he takes an interest in them, such as with Kiku, he will very vocally degrade them should they annoy him. If someone stands up to him and threatens his honor, Urashima has no problem with attacking them brutally to ensure his honor is not tainted, even against a woman. He is easily susceptible to the influence of people who encourage and enable him to use his status for his own benefit, such as Mouseman. Because of his conceit, Urashima often does whatever he wants regardless of how it affects other people. He once ordered some restaurant owners to cook their beloved pet raccoon dog for him to eat simply because he liked its meat. He also dislikes leftovers. While sumo wrestling, he sometimes intentionally uses illegal moves, as seen when he tried to jab at Luffy's eyes in their fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being of samurai class, along with his national athlete status, Urashima is of high social status within Wano, and is wealthy. He could order around and kill lower-class citizens without legal repercussion, simply because of his standing. As a yokozuna, the highest ranking sumo wrestler, Urashima is anextremely skilled and formidable sumo wrestler.Supplemented with his massive strength which is stated to be \"almost inhuman,\" he is capable of sending heavy sumo wrestlers flyinggreat distances away, and most of his opponents end up having many of their bones broken. He can also take on multiple people at once with ease, having once beaten 19 people in the ring, all of whom he has inflicted extensive injuries, and even when distracted, Urashima instantly took down three sumo wrestlers simultaneously with little effort. Despite being in the yokozuna rank, his skill is nowhere near Kawamatsu's, who is considered to be the strongest sumo wrestler in Wano. Urashima's main style of fighting is harite, where he strikes opponents on and around their face with his open palms, and usually overpowers them with his brute strength. He is capable of matching the base strength of Monkey D. Luffy in a harite clash, although Luffy was not using Busoshoku Haki at the time and easily overpowered Urashima with the massive strength of Gear 3. Despite his large size, Urashima is very fast and is capable of performing attacks in rapid succession. Urashima carries two katanas on his left hip, but it is unknown if he is skilled at using them."},

{"name": "Urouge", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Urouge is abundant in both height and width. His face somewhat resembles a smiling totem mask as he is nearly always seen grinning, even when he is unhappy; the only moments he is not seen smiling was when he was approaching Raijin Island, when he was confounded by the island spewing lightning nonstop, and again when he gives final benedictions to Kaidou's jumping off a sky island. Apart from his smile, he also has what appears to be a stitched-up scar vertically descending over, and falling short just above his left eye. On his chin he has a prominent, jet-black, and scruffy beard that extends upwards to the sides of his jaw and then converges with his equally-dark side-burns. He seems to sport the short and clean-cut sort of hairstyle generally sported by monks. He also has black tattoos going down his shoulders that somewhat resemble fire. He dresses in similar robes to Divine Soldiers underneath the khaki robes he wears (which is also worn by the rest of his crew), which includes the white full-bodied garment with severed sleeves, that exposes tattoos patterned like flames on both biceps. He wears a pair of gold earrings, black gloves and a rather large red bead necklace. He also has a pair of large wings growing out from the middle of his back. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Urouge is shown with the hairstyle and wings of the Skypieans', but as an adult, his wings are more like the Birka natives.", "personality": "Urouge's most prominent personality trait is that he is almost always smiling. Even when defeated or when believing himself to be near death, he will still have a smile on his face, such as when he was heavily wounded by a Pacifista. The only times he has not been seen smiling are when his crew approached Raijin Island and when he prayed for Kaidou. From what has been shown of Urouge so far he can be considered a brave man, as he was not afraid of fighting people with higher bounties than him, such as Killer. However, it is possible that he did not know his bounty or he knew that Killer had a high bounty because he notoriously attacks civilians. In spite of this though, he quit the battle when X Drake jumped in to halt the fight. Despite being brave he is not blind to danger either, for when he faced a Pacifista (who he believed was the real Kuma) and Kizaru at the same time, he wondered if that was his end. However, even when facing death, he could still laugh at what he believed was a joke, made by Basil Hawkins, about his fate. Urouge seems to be respectful toward people's plights, as he did not stop Kaidou when the Emperor attempted to commit suicide and instead prayed.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Worst Generation, Urouge is a powerful pirate, having managed to traverse and survive the dangers of the Grand Line and earn a bounty of 108,000,000 by the time he and his crew reached the Sabaody Archipelago. After the timeskip, Urouge was strong enough to defeat Charlotte Snack, one of Big Mom's Four Sweet Commanders and one of the strongest members of the Emperor's crew with a bounty of 600,000,000, although he was later defeated by Charlotte Cracker, another Sweet Commander in the Big Mom Pirates (although he was possibly exhausted from his first fight with Snack). However despite his defeat, Urouge managed to survive and retreat. Befitting his physique, Urouge has enormous strength, able to wield a large and heavy pillar as a makeshift mace, despite his size, he is deceptively fast with extremely sharp reflexes, able to keep up with Killer's tremendous agility and also hold his own against his fellow Supernova who has a significantly higher bounty in a fight before having their fight interrupted by X Drake. Urouge ate a currently unnamed Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to convert damage inflicted onto him into physical strength, which results in expanding muscles and enlarged body size. Using this ability, he was able to exceed a Pacifista's body size and actually damage it with his punches, although he was still vulnerable to its lasers and a kick from Admiral Kizaru. Urouge's choice of weapon appears to be a large piece of a pillar with a hexagonal base which he uses as a makeshift mace to pummel opponents. When not in use, it is mostly seen being carried on his shoulder."},

{"name": "Ulti", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "Her name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978.", "appearance": "Ulti is a young woman of middling height, with a light complexion. Her hair reaches near her mid-back and forms rounded locks mainly blue in coloration, but with thin, pink-colored streaks running through (plus a single white one over her left eye). Blunt bangs fall on her forehead, split near the left, and an ahoge stands up on her head. Characteristically (as with many of her crewmates), Ulti has horns: a sharp, upward-curving pair emerging from the sides of her head, white in color, that resemble a bull's. Ulti's eyes are large, round, fringed by long lashes, and encompass violet irises. Her lower face up to the nose is covered by a pink mask with a scalloped edge, trimmed with a white stripe; Ulti keeps this mask even when she assumes her pachycephalosaurus form. When in her Human-Beast Form, Ulti's bangs are pushed back, exposing her forehead. Otherwise, Ulti takes to wearing a long-sleeved minidress that is white and pleated above the waist, with a blue bow below a point collar. The dress's lower, light-blue, and non-pleated section, with a button placket in the middle, ends in a short skirt part that has a slightly ruffled hem, leaving most of Ulti's legs visible. Fastened on her shoulders is a darker-blue cape trimmed with light-blue fur on its edges (the inside also blue), which goes near the ground, and her footwear are red high heels.", "personality": "Ulti is a bold, rude, and short-tempered young woman, not one to back down from a verbal quarrel and regularly threatening violence against those who annoy her. Somewhat fickle, she is shown acting friendly and trying to come off as refined, mature one moment, then yelling whilst dangerously blunt the next. Not even the likes of Queen or Kaidou, both her direct superiors (and the latter of whom most crew members seem at least somewhat afraid of), are safe from her vitriol, implying that she does not fear them at all, even to her fellow Tobiroppo's shock. Also, Ulti has no issue with generally acting in a highly casual manner towards Kaidou, expressing loud, girly glee during their reunion. Ulti is merciless towards enemies and willing to brutalize them without hesitation. She is also not above hitting a child if annoyed, as seen when she clawed at Tama for begging her to stop hurting her friend. In battle, due to her aggressive nature, Ulti is quick to attack anyone she deems an enemy. Still, she remains a quick decision-maker and keeps her guard up continuously, as shown when she set upon and seemingly crushed Monkey D. Luffy in their first clash. Rather than gloat and let down her guard like the grunts around her, Ulti instead kept track of him using Haki, quickly transforming and readying for further combat upon sensing Luffy's own Haki. Ulti has a somewhat vengeful streak. She tends to grow extremely angry over, and swear to get payback for, enemies hurting her or her brother, Page One, even when the responsible party is much stronger than Ulti, like the Emperor Big Mom. Despite her childish bearing, Ulti can be smarter than she lets on. In the past, she managed to steal two Devil Fruits from Kaidou to give to herself and her brother, thus giving them the strength necessary for them to survive in the crew and ultimately rise through its ranks. In her speech, Ulti follows certain \"trends\" to come across as fancy. Since her debut, she has taken to ending her sentences (sometimes incorrectly) with arinsu (?)an archaic, polite copula and variant of arimasu that means \"to be\" and is associated with courtesans/oiranas well as the first-person pronoun achiki (?), likewise associated with courtesans. According to Page One, said verbal habits (which become a generally sophisticated register in the Viz translation) are an attempt of Ulti's to sound like a fancy lady. When she snaps due to being annoyed, however, Ulti slips into a vulgar and bratty tone and uses the more neutral pronoun \"watashi\" (?), showing how superficial the woman's mature manner of talking is. Overall, Ulti has had many different ways of ending her sentences that changed over time (see below).", "abilities_and_powers": "Being one of the Tobiroppo, Ulti holds great authority among the Beast Pirates despite her young age, with only Kaidou and the All-Stars ranking above her. True to her Tobiroppo status and 400,000,000 bounty, Ulti is a very powerful combatant, enough so to pose a threat to Luffya Worst Generation member with a bounty over one billion higher than hers at the timeand have him both remark on her great power and consider using Gear 4 when Ulti held him down. Together with Page One, Ulti was able to effortlessly defeat Nami and Usopp; the former, in particular, Ulti has been able to get the better of and subdue in a matter of seconds. Despite her small frame, Ulti's physical strength is immense, even when she is not transformed into her dinosaur form. This is chiefly seen from the extreme offensive power of her headbutts, her signature style of attack. She can thrust her head forward with incredible force and unleash blows so powerful, they have been compared to the blast of a cannon. Even when only in her human form, Ulti was able to overpower Luffy, who has tremendous strength of his own, in a headbutting clash, creating a violent shockwave and sending Luffy flying back, though the latter emerged with little to no injury. It has been stated by Ulti herself and others that her headbutts can split or completely crush an enemy's skull. Against physically weaker foes like Nami and Usopp, Ulti's headbutts have indeed proven able to cause disabling injury and (in Usopp's case) crack a skull. Ulti even managed to physically contend with Yamato, Kaidou's child who boasts immense brawn himself, for some time, although Ulti was ultimately overpowered. Even in human form, Ulti has immense durability, noted by Zeus to be extremely tough on the outside. She is able to bash her bare head against targets with extreme force, in succession and remain unfazed (though her use of Busoshoku may aid her in this). It ultimately took a multitude of powerful lightning bolts piercing through and dealing internal damage to Ulti (including a super-concentrated fire-and-lightning beam created by Big Mom, on top of lightning guided by Zeus to engulf Ulti's entire body) to knock her out. Ulti ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pachycephalosaurus, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows her to become a full pachycephalosaurus and a human-pachycephalosaurus hybrid at will. Ulti's crewmates consider her full Beast Form excessive force against most enemies, likely to wreak great collateral damage, and she only uses it against opponents she takes seriously. When transformed, Ulti's already immense physical power increases; in her full Beast Form, she could immobilize Luffy by grabbing hold of the pirate's shoulders, despite his own incredible strength. Furthermore, as a dinosaur, Ulti is much tougher than regular Zoan users, swiftly recovering from Yamato's Raimei Hakke, which only briefly rendered her unconscious after a direct hit, and remaining conscious after a powerful bolt of lightning piercing her abdomen. Ulti's mobility, too, is enhanced, allowing her to disappear from sight and dart around extremely swiftly. As the most notable aspect of her power, both in her Human-Beast form and Full Beast form (most so the latter), Ulti gains an extremely durable, super-thick skull plate that perfectly complements her signature headbutting attacks. Ulti is very skilled in using Busoshoku Haki, being able to harden her forehead, which allows her to strengthen the force of her headbutts. She was capable of clashing against and overpowered Luffy, a powerful Busoshoku Haki user himself, in their initial encounter, despite Luffy's own use of Hardening. Ulti can use Kenbunshoku Haki, having shown usage of it to sense Luffy's Haki and realize he was still alive after she had attacked him. Though Ulti was also able to sense Yamato coming toward her at one point, she could not avoid his surprise attack in time. Ulti wields a sharp-spiked, yellow, morning star-like club, which she used to clash with the kanabo-wielding Yamato."},

{"name": "Trebol", "episode": "Episode 700", "chapter": "Chapter 629", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Trebol is a toweringly tall hunchback who, despite his impairment, looms over his captain Doflamingo at a similar height to Diamante and Pica. His appearance is dishevelled and unkempt. His attire consists of a long, ragged blue coat (initially dark grey, then cyan in the anime) made of his Devil Fruit mucus with a navy (dark in the anime) blue ring pattern. Mucus and sticky slime constantly trail from the coat's hem. The front of the coat is cleverly designed to resemble the front of a barrel chest, making Trebol appear to be a thickset man wearing a loose cloak over his shoulders. In truth, he is extremely skinny to the point of being emaciated, and everything under the hollow of his stooped chest is a decoy made of mucus. His posture and attire make him look like a giant snail. Trebol is barefoot but wears a mid-length chained-shackle on each of his ankles, which are not linked together. He usually wears a pair of sunglasses covering his small slanted eyes and has a broad flat nose, commonly seen with snot hanging out of it. He wears his dark hair in a bowl-cut, complete with a long, thick beard and stubble on his upper lip. His lips are a bit thicker than normal, and his teeth are round and have some space between them. He also has a small scar just above his right eyebrow. He holds a scepter with a club suit design on the top. This scepter also has a lighter built into it, which he can use to ignite his mucus. As a child, Trebol lacked his mucus coat, but his nose was still constantly running. He wore a bowler hat, his signature sunglasses, and a tattered shirt and pants. He used sandals before, at some point ending up with shackles in place of actual shoes. He appeared to have grown up on the streets, judging by his dirty, tattered appearance and having scrounged for food. At 18 and 33 years old, he lacked a beard. He continued wearing his bowler hat and also used a cane, which he may have replaced with the scepter he holds currently. At age 39, he was no longer using his bowler hat, taking on an appearance similar to his current one. He also changed the design of his mucus coat to represent his position as the Club seat of the Donquixote Family. When he was 47, Trebol had started using his gold scepter and changed his coat to a striped version with colors slightly paler than the scheme of his most recent coat. His hair and even part of his lip took on a sloppy, dribbling appearance, oozing downwards from the effects of his Devil Fruit, but Trebol later reverted to the facial appearance he had during Doflamingo's takeover of Dressrosa.", "personality": "Trebol seems to have a problem with how close he gets to someone with whom he is talking, making people comment that he is too close. He is somewhat bold, obnoxious, and insensitive, as he casually asked Baby 5 if Doflamingo killed another one of her fiancs, as well as asking Baby 5 to marry him as a joke, knowing that it would make Baby 5 feel compelled to help him. Trebol can also act rashly and violent, as upon realizing that the Straw Hat Pirates are attacking Sugar, he instantly threw a ship at the Officer Tower without considering the damage or risk to Sugar or caring that he was destroying the expensive vessel of a crew who came to do business with the Donquixote Family while cruelly setting the captured dwarves on fire and sadistically mocking their belief in Usopp being their savior before stomping on each and every one of them. Despite his insensitive and cruel behavior, he has no tolerance for anyone who insults his family, as he grew angry when a peon giggled at Pica's voice, as well as getting enraged whenever someone directly insults him, as seen when he lunged at Law after the latter insulted him despite Doflamingo warning him not to. After Law wounds Trebol with Sterben, he attempts to kill Law by using his staff to cause a devastating explosion though Law survives after that. While Trebol is caring towards the Donquixote Family, he can be rude and disrespectful to his subordinates, even the ones Doflamingo held deep connections to. He referred to Sugar as a brat and laughed at Senor Pink's infant clothing. However, this appears to be mutual as Trebol retorted to Lao G's comment about Sugar being a child by stating she is not. A very profuse and off-putting amount of mucus tends to drip and hang from Trebol's nose (most likely because of his Devil Fruit powers), and he will often say he cannot help it, sometimes snotting more when he laughs or has been excited or startled. Trebol is confident in himself, taking the role of Sugar's bodyguard very seriously and teaming up with Doflamingo to fight Luffy and Law. He was assured about his Devil Fruit, as his mucus will subdue anybody. He also has the utmost pride in Doflamingo as he believes Doflamingo to be the rightful king of Dressrosa. He also believed if the Straw Hats were to make it underground, Sugar would just turn them into toys. Similar to Doflamingo, Trebol's arrogance and overconfidence take a carefree attitude, although it also makes him underestimate his opponents, and he will begin to panic should there be events that leave him astonished. Likewise, Trebol refused to heed Doflamingo's request to bring Sugar back to the castle, only to be utterly shocked upon seeing Sugar fainted after seeing Usopp making a horrifying face that traumatized her. When Trebol tried to wake Sugar up, he lamented the toys reverting to their original forms, which exposed Doflamingo's tyranny. When Luffy and Doflamingo clashed, Trebol was shocked to see that Luffy can use Haoshoku Haki like Doflamingo. In spite of this, Trebol believed Luffy to be incapable of defeating Doflamingo. After Trebol got insulted by Law's claim that Doflamingo was just using him and the other Elite Officers as puppets, Trebol took it upon himself to kill Law as he believed he could not do anything since he was bound by his mucus. However, it greatly cost him as Law manipulated his severed arm that was holding his sword into cutting him. Being seriously wounded, he tried to kill Law to the point of using a suicide attack. Trebol is worshipful of Haoshoku Haki, as he claims it to be a quality of a king. Doflamingo's usage of Haoshoku Haki was the reason Trebol and the other Elite Officers took him under their wing and did whatever he wanted. Like many One Piece characters, Trebol has a distinct laugh: \"Behehehehe\". He also has a unique speech pattern, frequently beginning his sentences with \"Ne\" or \"Ne, ne\" (which translates to \"Hey\", or \"Hey, hey\"), and in some cases, though uncommon, he will repeat \"Ne\" more than twice in a row. He speaks in a very nasally manner, causing the words to sound more along the lines of \"Nyeh\", or \"Nyeh, nyehh\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Trebol occupies the Club seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself, and is the staff officer of his pirate crew. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Trebol Army, with Sugar, Violet (before her defection), and Giolla, all of whom specialized as a special powers team, as his subordinates. Even as an 18-year-old, Trebol was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Diamante, and Pica, all of whom are younger than him. At 39 years old, Trebol, along with Diamante and Pica, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Alongside Diamante, Trebol defeated the dozens of ex-toys who tried to destroy the SMILE Factory without even receiving a single injury. Trebol was knowledgeable of Haki even before hemet Doflamingo, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki are qualified to become king. As noted by Robin, Trebol has extraordinary hand-eye coordination, making him a powerful shooter. With a bullet made of mucus fired from his index finger at extreme speed, he casually shot down a nearby fly mid-flight, just seconds after noticing it, hitting it directly between its eyes while piercing a wall behind with explosive force, blasting through three layers of reinforced concrete. Trebol is extremely fast and can leap over long distances at impressive speeds. Despite his build, Trebol has a tremendous level of physical strength, as he lifted a giant ship out of a harbor and threw it like a flail, smashing it halfway through the concrete-domed roof of the Officer's Tower, which then caused the entire building to collapse. He appeared to take little damage from one of Luffy's kicks, though he was knocked aside. Trebol ate the Beta Beta no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit, which gives him the ability to create and control mucus. His mucus is very thick and possesses great adhesiveness. Because his mucus is so sticky, he can use it to stick to walls and ceilings, restrain and smother people to restrain them, his mucus is even strong enough to restrain whole ships. He can also use his power to fire off mucus bullets with extreme speed and precision. The mucus is dangerously flammable, to the point of exploding on contact with even a tiny spark. Trebol can use this to his advantage and make his attacks more potent. He is able to make his mucus change color, an attribute that he puts into practice to fool his opponents. Trebol, despite being slim, produces very baggy clothing made out of mucus, part of which is colored to look like a plus-sized torso. This can cause people to miss his actual body when they attack since they are lead to believe that their target is larger than he actually is. Trebol wields a staff with a club suit design on the top. The top of the staff is a lighter, which he uses in conjuncture with his flammable mucus ability, while the bottom is sharp, allowing him to stab someone with it. At 18 years old, Trebol carried with him several flintlock pistols, with one, in particular, he gave to Doflamingo as a gift and another one he used to kill a thug who assaulted Doflamingo. Trebol possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Her attire appears to be less formal than the other high-ranking officers', consisting of an untucked shirt, with the sleeves rolled up and a tie around her neck, and calves-long pants, which makes her somewhat resemble the animal of her name, the crane. She sports earrings made of beads, and wears two bracelets on her right wrist. The epaulets on her Marine coat are golden for the outer epaulets and purple with two white dots for the inner epaulets. During the time of the Battle of Edd War, they were the standard blue. Twenty-seven years ago, at age 49, her skin was already wrinkled despite only being middle-aged.

She wore a standard Marine uniform with a rifle strapped to her back.", "personality": "She is a veteran Marine who is not without wisdom for her age. She seems extremely knowledgeable; she knew Donquixote Doflamingo set the Marines to fight each other in the Marine and Warlord meeting when all others thought the two were simply messing around, and knew who Laffitte was on sight. She is not above telling off the younger marines that show concern for her well-being when she steps up to fight the incoming pirates at Marine HQ. She then justifies herself being on the front line with the other vice admirals by stating there is no longer a safe place left in the world for her to run to anyway. According to Garp, she is an empathetic woman although she does not show thisdisposition very often. Tsuru follows \"Clean Justice\" or \"Cleansing Justice\". This motto was first seen in the Adventure of Nebulandia special and was confirmed to be canon in Vivre Card databook.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a veteran Vice Admiral from the same generation of Marines as Garp and Sengoku, Tsuru is one of the most prominent Marines in the world. She is well-renowned and recognized as a legendary figure by the likes of Franky and Usopp. Even in her elderly age of 63, Tsuru was strong enough to strike intense fear into Doflamingo, who even becoming a Warlord of the Sea was an extremely powerful pirate, as he was quick to flee during her many pursuits of the Donquixote Pirates throughout the North Blue, and despite his initial plans to reclaim Law from the Marines's custody to use his powers to immortalized himself, Doflamingo quickly changed this plan upon seeing her battleship off the coast of Minion Island. Several years later, when Doflamingo lost his title as a Warlord, he still showed respect for her, a stark contrast to his usual disrespect to other high-ranking Marines. Alongside Sengoku and Issho, she was part of Doflamingo's Marine escort who fought against Jack, a right-hand man of Emperor Kaidou. Tsuru has vast knowledge of criminals from various parts of the world, being able to instantly recognize Laffitte and explain his history to Sengoku. She is present at important meetings concerning the Three Great Powers, such as the meeting to determine Crocodile's successor in the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Tsuru is said to be second to none in experience and knowledge and acted as a renowned staff officer for Fleet Admiral Sengoku before his retirement. Tsuru ate the Woshu Woshu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to literally \"wash and hang out to dry\" people and objects as if they were clothes, turning them into flat and malleable like fabric. This disables the opponents by rendering them unable to move. This power can also \"clean\" a limited amount of evil off the victims, which is considered a dangerous ability against pirates. In her youth, she is seen with a flintlock rifle. How proficient she is in using it is unknown.

Because of his absent-minded nature, he tends to behave recklessly and sometimes acts without thinking or taking important things into consideration, as he tried to set a world record for the tallest pair of stilts in the world, but didn't consider how he'd get down or that he'd be afraid of heights, resulting in him being stuck for 10 years, and also ate some milk that has gone bad and curdled for a very long time, resulting in him getting food poisoning.

He appears to be patient, as he was content to observe Shanks' potentially threatening actions and not rush to intervene. However, he cursed Crocodile and Luffy for threatening the balance when the latter removed the former from the Seven Warlords of the Sea, saying that Luffy could not be forgiven. He also wishes to preserve the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. He appears to take positions of authority seriously, as he disapproved of Admiral Aokiji going off on his own without telling anyone. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral, but Warcury was especially abrasive toward Sakazuki, reminding him of his place and failures by mentioning how Aokiji had joined forces with Blackbeard. He takes rebellion very seriously and said the annihilation of the Lulusia Kingdom could serve as an example to other unsettled governments. Compared to the other Elders, Warcury has appeared to display shreds of conscience regarding the lives of his subjects. When Imu ordered for the Lulusia Kingdom to be annihilated, Warcury brought up the fact that the kingdom was heavily populated; however, he had no qualms about going through with it once Imu reaffirmed the decision.

{"name": "Tony Tony Chopper", "episode": "Episode 134", "chapter": "Chapter 81", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Most of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more \"chibi\" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed. A running gag is that various characters in One Piece think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as \"a raccoon\") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form. The word \"tonakai\", which is the Japanese word for \"reindeer\", is where the \"Tony\" in Chopper's name is derived from. His Heavy Point or human form is likewise mistaken for a gorilla (or an abominable snowman on his home island). Similar to most of his male crewmates, Chopper has the same outfit throughout most of the series. In the Arabasta Arc, he wore a shirt with a green-lined collar, then a bigger one with giant sleeves that is light blue with dark blue liners. In the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a red leather jacket. In the Post Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a blue t-shirt with a white Galley-La Company logo on it. In the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore a crucifix necklace. After two years, Chopper is significantly leaner. He is less potbellied than he was in earlier seasons and his arms/forelimbs are also skinnier. It is arguable that since leaving the cold climate on Drum Island, he has lost significant body fat. The color of his fur has changed from brown to gold, and according to Nami (when she and Chopper reunite on Sabaody), the texture has gotten softer. Chopper now wears a blue cap that has a ring of dots around the circle, while the cap has buckles hanging from it. He wears this over his old pink hat. He also wears a white and yellow vertical-striped tank top, which he takes off when he transforms into Heavy Point, and an orange pair of shorts. Aside from being slightly slimmer and having his fur changing from dark brown into a light brown color, Chopper's Brain Point form has not changed. His Walk Point (reindeer) form has grown considerably, now being roughly as tall as Usopp. His horns are larger, he has more muscle, and his fur is longer. His Heavy Point has become exceedingly larger and more muscular, being almost the size of Dosun's. He also developed new transformations through his research during the timeskip, which he debuts on Fish-Man Island, including Kung Fu Point (which he uses to defeat Neptune's soldiers) and a revised Horn Point (which he uses against Daruma). While on Punk Hazard, he was given a black coat by Kin'emon using his Fuku Fuku No Mi. He was later dressed up in samurai attire made from the same ability when the crew had departed from Punk Hazard. At the start of the Dressrosa Arc, Chopper wore camouflage clothing. After the crew split up, he changed his headgear for the first time since the timeskip, putting on a football helmet with holes for his antlers that has three horizontal stripes running vertically down the middle, with two small ones beside one larger one, as well as large stars on each side of the helmet. He also put on a zippered coat with the same stripe pattern running horizontally all around the middle of the coat, with inverse coloration of the stripes on the helmet and a pattern of stars inside the large stripe on the coat. During his stay on Zou, Chopper's outfit consists of his original timeskip hat with a crown on top. He wears no shirt and has a long open coat with fur and fancy jewelry attached. Upon leaving Zou, Chopper wore an open doctor's coat. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, he wore a yellow overcoat and had a pink scarf wrapped around his hat. Afterwards, when meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates he wore an outfit similar to Luffy's, black suit (dark blue in the anime) with a green shirt and a yellow ascot. During the Wano Country Arc, he wore a green ninja outfit. Later, before the raid on Onigashima, Chopper wore a dark bluish-green samurai armor, complete with a Kabuto helmet and a Katana. During the raid on Onigashima, Chopper switches to a new set of samurai armor, this time red-colored, with a matching red Kabuto helmet, and his katana on the side of his hip. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, he wore a Beasts Pirates disguise with dark fur coat and a one horned hat with a star-like symbol in the middle. While under the effects of the Ice Oni virus, Chopper's body and armor became partially frozen over, with Chopper slowly developing a slightly more demonic appearance, and even developed partial fangs. Chopper's appearance was returned to normal shortly after administering the countervirus. During the Egghead Arc, Chopper wears a hooded long coat with the SSG logo on the front. He also wears a Hat resembling a space helmet, but with a visor attached and a pair of goggles also on top of it, as earpiece and a pair of DOM Shoes."},

{"name": "Trafalgar D. Water Law", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "His true name was revealed in Chapter 763.", "appearance": "Law is a slim young man of a relatively tall height. He has faint shadows right under his yellow eyes (grey in the anime), and his face is usually seen with a smirk. He wears a northern-style fur hat, which is white and has a spotted pattern along the bottom and the bill. He has short dark hair, a majority of which is obscured by his hat, save for his sideburns and a small goatee. His hair color is depicted as black in both the anime and manga, though sometimes the manga depicts it as blue. He has many tribal-style tattoos on his arms; on both of his hands are letters spelled as D E A T H tattooed in black on each of the back of his fingers. Originally in the manga, his right hand was not tattooed while his left thumb had the letter A missing. Later on, all of his fingers were tattooed completely with all five letters. He also has a black cross on the back of both of his hands. On his chest, he has a tribal-style heart tattoo with his Jolly Roger on it. He has a simpler heart tattoo on his shoulders and his Jolly Roger tattooed on his back. He is seen wearing a yellow hoodie, with black sleeves and black hood. The hoodie has his Jolly Roger printed on the front of the chest area in dark ink, and he keeps the sleeves rolled up. Law wears a northern-style fur hat that has a rim running all around it. It is white in color and has a black dot pattern along the rim and lower areas of the hat. Law also sports a pair of jeans with odd dots on both the knee and ankle areas, similar to the ones on his hat, but darker in color. He sports a pair of dark, pointed shoes. He has a pair of small earrings on each ear. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Law is shown with his fur hat and his faint shadows right under his eyes but wore the uniform for the medical academy he was attending: a blue lab coat with a red tie, dark blue shorts, and green shoes. He was also holding a scalpel on his right hand and a frog on his left hand, since he was already in training to become a surgeon with his father being his teacher. After escaping Flevance, Law lost his tie and lab coat, and his shirt underneath became more raggedy, and his shorts have white spots on them. Because of his heritage, he inherited the Amber Lead Syndrome that accumulated throughout the generations of Flevance, which left his skin white and pallid until he obtained his cure. In Oda's depiction of the Supernovas post-timeskip, he seems to have lost the fur rim of his hat, and replaced it with a thick bill, turning it into a rather spherical hat resembling a Wool Skipper. His goatee has become somewhat scruffier, and his right hand now also has the fingers tattooed. He now wears a yellow t-shirt similar in appearance to his old hoodie. He wears a black hoodie over the t-shirt, which features his Jolly Roger on the chest area in yellowish-orange ink. The sleeves of the hoodie are no longer rolled up, and it now has a fluffy fur collar. During the Punk Hazard Arc, Law wears a long black coat with his crew's jolly roger along the hem and on the sleeve. During the Dressrosa Arc, he wears an open black coat with a hood which features the word Corazon on the back. During his second confrontation with Doflamingo, Law's right arm was cut off. It is later reattached by Leo and healed by Mansherry. During the Zou Arc, Law changed into a dark, short-sleeved shirt with a light-colored heart pattern on the lower left side. He also bears stitch marks on his right arm after it being reattached by Leo. During the Wano Country Arc, Law wears a black and white yukata with his two Jolly Roger, an orange sash, a brown jittoku with yellow five-petal flower patterns and spots, and zri. He briefly wears a tengai to hide his identity from his enemies such as Hawkins. During the Raid on Onigashima, Law wears a yellow shirt and a blue cloak with fluffy fur collar. Law's outfit had different colors (a black cloak with a brown fluffy fur collar, a white collared shirt, and dark blue pants) in the original \"DREAMIN' ON\" opening."},

Following Thatch's murder, his crew was unable to cook meals of the same quality, and Whitebeard's health started to deteriorate faster as a result. Thatch carried a three-foot-long kitchen knife on his right hip and was skilled at using it like a commander. However, Vista was superior to him as a swordsman. In the anime, Thatch is seen carrying a sword on his right hip. He was also shown dual-wielding swords and was capable of fighting the Decalvan Brothers, although he was struggling a bit.[citation needed]"},

She looks remarkably similar to the late Kuina, Zoro's childhood friend. She wears rectangular glasses with red frames. Before the timeskip, she was seen wearing short-sleeved shirts of varying different colors and designs but usually covered them with her white-trimmed, waist-length blue leather coat. She tended to wear dark blue jeans with black shoes but has also paired white capris with tan shoes. Her face and hair have changed slightly several times since her introduction, especially noticeably in Chapter 439. However, it is not clear whether this was an intentional redesign or simply a result of the author's continually evolving art style and the length of time she had been out of the spotlight. After the timeskip, her hair is much longer and now pinned up by a clip. She still wears glasses, and her figure has become more feminine than it was two years ago. She was seen wearing a floral button-down shirt, blue capris, dark pink gloves with a white trim, and dark pink boots. Having achieved the rank of captain, she replaced her blue coat with a pink version of the standard Marine officers' coat. As with Hina, Tashigi's subordinates tend to fawn over her, but it is clear that they also respect her as their superior.", "personality": "Tashigi was first introduced when the Straw Hat Pirates docked in Loguetown, where she was stationed. Smoker, her superior officer, seems to regard her as a protege, and the two work very well together. Despite her proficiency in sword fighting, she is usually clumsy, which gets on Smoker's nerves. She is extremely interested in katanas, often identifying their names and origins on sight; even when in danger, she may be distracted by the presence of a famed blade. During the Loguetown Arc, she was even shown carrying what seemed to be a pocket Meito field guide. Tashigi is very brave and reckless when fighting her opponents, a trait typical of swordswomen and swordsmen. She will battle anyone she considers an enemy, regardless of their reputation. This fighting spirit often turns into carelessness and has led to her defeat on several occasions, much to Smoker's disdain. Two examples would be her fight against Nico Robin, during which her knee was broken, and her fight against Law, during which she was cut in half. She is also stubborn and may refuse to accept defeat if she feels she has been looked down upon, as seen when she demanded a rematch with Zoro, indignant that he did not cut her down. She even refused to give up after Law separated her torso from her legs and chopped Shigure in half. Her endless determination could be interpreted as a \"sore loser\" attitude, but it seems to derive from her desire to protect what is important to her. Like Smoker, Tashigi's definition of \"justice\" differs from that of the Marines as a whole, and she does not hesitate to fight in its defense. Her stated goal is to remove all Meito from the hands of those who would use them for their own selfish ambitions. Despite her distaste for pirates, Tashigi is willing to work with them and abandon her Marine pride if she deems it necessary for the greater good. Tashigi felt that, as a swordswoman, she would be perceived as inferior to swordsmen by default, and she accused Zoro of refusing to cut her because of her gender. She also felt insulted when Law cut her without killing her. As a swordswoman, she would rather face death than be shamefully defeated. However, this does not stop her from trying hard to get stronger and achieve her dreams. Tashigi wears her shirts buttoned up higher and shows less cleavage than many other female characters, indicating that she is somewhat reserved about her body. This was especially apparent when she was trapped in Smoker's body, as she wore his jacket fully closed and protested heavily when Smoker (trapped in her body) took off her bra and wore her shirt completely unbuttoned. Her shyness was also shown when she screamed in embarrassment after returning to her body and finding it in that state of undress. One of Tashigi's most prominent character traits is her absentmindedness. When Smoker was chasing after Luffy during the Arabasta Arc, she failed to recognize the situation until Smoker told her what to do. In the anime, she had a brief but polite interaction with Chopper without realizing that he was a talking reindeer. The most significant example of her oblivious nature was when, in the Loguetown Arc, Tashigi spent a very long time failing to realize that the three-swords-carrying, haramaki-wearing swordsman she had befriended was, in fact, the three-swords-carrying, haramaki-wearing Pirate Hunter, Roronoa Zoro.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine captain, she has command over lower-ranking Marines. Tashigi mostly relies on her great speed and agility in battle. She has been aiming to get stronger since the end of the Arabasta arc. After the timeskip, Tashigi has shown considerable strength, able to apply enough force on Shigure to deflect a cannonball. Her speed and agility has also greatly improved, able to jump to very tall heights as well as using the Rokushiki Soru technique to move instantaneously. Tashigi has shown exceptional pain tolerance, able to withstand Monet violently frostbiting her shoulder. Tashigi is a highly skilled Gentle Blade type swordswoman, capable of defeating two pirates in Loguetown with little effort and quickly take down multiple opponents within seconds. Tashigi has encyclopedic knowledge about swords, as shown in the sword shop at Loguetown. She has carried her sword on both her left and right side, suggesting that she is capable of comfortably drawing it with either hand. Tashigi's personal katana is the Meito Shigure. After the timeskip, her skills have improved, as she was able to precisely deflect an enemy cannonball with her katana in the same way Dracule Mihawk has deflected bullets. After the timeskip, Tashigi was seen using Soru to avoid snowballs in her fight against Monet. During her battle with Trafalgar Law, Smoker revealed that Tashigi uses Haki but stated that her aptitude with it is not yet enough to counter Law's ability. Tashigi possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. She was able to cut Monet, a Logia user, causing her to bleed. Tashigi possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

She wears the traditional skimpy wear of the Kuja warriors, and also carries a snake weapon with her. She wears a coat around her shoulders, like Marine Officers, and has a very square, thick chin. She also wears her hair in pigtails.", "personality": "Sweet Pea is mostly distinguished by her strange attribute of making quotes and adding saga/volume to the end of her sentences, such as saying, \"a race against time\" when they found out that Luffy did not have much time before the mushrooms enveloped him. She seems to follow orders without trouble, as she would listen to Marguerite's orders without fail. She helped pick off the mushrooms covering Luffy and burn them all off. She was as surprised as the others were when she found out that Luffy was male. She seems to respect Boa Hancock as any other Kuja would, due to the fact that she got on her knees and bowed to her. She also seems to be honorable, as she said it was her fault that Luffy was alive, as she helped get the mushrooms off and initially saved him from dying.", "abilities_and_powers": "She was seen accompanying Boa Hancock on the Kuja pirate ship after the two year timeskip, indicating that she has become strong enough to become part of the crew, since only the strongest warriors are allowed on the ship. Like most, if not all, citizens of Amazon Lily, she is able to use Busoshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Tamagon", "episode": "Episode 325", "chapter": "Chapter 231", "year": 2004, "note": "His name was revealed in SBS Volume 45.", "appearance": "Tamagon has a rounded body shape and is usually seen wearing goggles. He also wears a waistcoat as well as a red bowtie to match. Like the other members of the Franky Family, his lower body part is covered in bandages. After the timeskip, he retains his signature bowtie and goggles, but now wears a Galley-La shirt and his hair is seen having slightly grown.", "personality": "When he met Franky, Tamagon came to deeply respect him and called him \"Aniki\" just like the other Franky Family members. Though he has respect for Franky, he is quite mischievous, since he stole Frankys swim briefs.", "abilities_and_powers": "During the raid of Enies Lobby he is shown wielding a sword and a bazooka.

{"name": "T Bone", "episode": "Episode 365", "chapter": "Chapter 257", "year": 2005, "note": "He was first mentioned by Corgi in Chapter 362.", "appearance": "T Bone had curly long black hair, a skeletal face, and a long neck, and was missing one tooth. He was pot-bellied with muscular arms and thin legs. Even after becoming a Marine, his overall appearance mirrored his former occupation: he was clad in golden, sleeveless chain mail armor with an ornately decorated collar and he wore a helmet with a long, flowing purple plume on the top. Over his cuirass, he had a tunic emblazoned with the Marine symbol. He had a rope belt tied around his waist, similar to the ones worn by some samurai. His attire was completed by standard light-blue pants and shoes. It should be noted that many elements of his outfit had one or more crosses on them: his helmet, the pendants hanging from his belt, and his sword's hilt. He carried around his signature weapon, a decorated sword reminiscent of the ones used by Templars in popular fiction, either on his right hip (suggesting he may have been left-handed or ambidextrous) or hanging from his back. Also, instead of wearing the standard officer's Marine coat, he had a high-collared mantle with the kanji for \"justice\" (, Seigi?) printed on it. He tore it to pieces during the travel on the Puffing Tom in order to treat his injured comrades; however, he seemed to have repaired it or have gotten a new one in his appearance in the Marineford Arc. After the Summit War, he grew a very horizontal straight line mustache and two lined beard on his chin. In his younger days in the Marines, he had shorter hair and sported a standard Marine cap.", "personality": "T Bone was a very honorable and considerate person, and he absolutely abhorred needless violence. His main fault was his tendency to take life very seriously - although he valued the soldiers under his command, he had a tendency to fuss over their minor problems in a melodramatic manner, which could make them uncomfortable. He was noted for being far too willing to sacrifice himself, even when the situation did not call for something so drastic. Apparently, he had a penchant for dramatic phrasing, and he often spoke about honor and justice. He believed very strongly that it is a Marine's duty to protect innocent people. He had a very strong will that was shown when he left his detached train car and ran across the train tracks completely indifferent to the storm going around him. He believed every criminal he let get away leaves an innocent person in danger. Because of this, he did anything and everything in his power to catch them even if it meant claiming his own life. He claimed to dislike curved swords, such as Zoro's. His own sword-fighting style even reflected a lack of crooked swings, preferring to slash in straight motions or sharp right angles. T Bone's motto was \"Do 100 good deeds every day\", and because he disliked unnecessary violence so much and wished to protect life, he was also a vegan.", "abilities_and_powers": "T Bone was well reputed within the Marines which is why he was permanentlystationed attheir headquarters at Marinefordand later New Marineford where he reported directly to the higher brass. T Bone was extremely strong and resistant: his thin and apparently frail legs allowed him to run for a long time on the Sea Train's rails during a storm. He was struck by a hit strong enough to destroy his own sword without receiving permanent damage. The force he applied in his sword strikes could cut through metal trains, large ships, and even giant Sea Kings in half. Also, Zoro commented to himself twice that T Bone was strong, and the fact that their fight lasted only moments does not mean he was inferior to Zoro at all (at that point the fight could only be settled in mere moments as the Rocketman was racing towards the rails T Bone was standing on). T Bone was renowned for his incredible mastery in swordsmanship: he was capable of generating flying slashes from the force of his sword strikes, something only the strongest swordsmen like Roronoa Zoro and Dracule Mihawk have been capable of. His sword strikes were powerful enough to cut through trains, boats, and Sea Kings. T Bone was known as the \"Ship-Cutter\" (, Funekiri?) for his prowess in swordsmanship; according to Zambai, T Bone could easily slice large ships like cutting steaks. T Bone wielded a sword called Bamboo. It is a sword with a perfectly straight blade and is finely decorated, as well as the hilt. During his fight with Zoro, his sword was broken in twoby the pirate. It was presumablyfixed by the time of theSummit War of Marineford. It was stated that all vice admirals possess Haki, so T Bone can also use the ability."},

{"name": "Tamago", "episode": "Episode 651", "chapter": "Chapter 570", "year": 2012, "note": "", "appearance": "Baron Tamago is tall due to his long and lanky thin legs. He has many wrinkles on his forehead and a big mustache that curls upwards. He also wears sunglasses and has a scar over his left eye which he lost during a previous fight with Pedro five years ago. On top of his head, he sports a magenta cup full of hot tea and saucer which he drinks from at times. As Baron Tamago, he appears to wear magenta pants with an egg shell like shape that goes up to his belly. He wears a formal magenta tuxedo as well, along with a pink shirt underneath, and a yellow bowtie. He carries a long wooden cane with him. Tamago's rather strange appearance caused Zoro to comically mistake him for a compass. As Viscount Hiyoko, he has a yellow skin color, and his arms and hands have transformed into wings. His attire changed and he has a yellow suit with white pants. As Count Niwatori, he resembles a large rooster wearing a pale pink suit.", "personality": "Tamago always uses French words like \"bon\" at the beginning of his sentences and \"soir\" and \"s'il vous plat\" at the end of his sentences. He uses \"bon\" as a suffix and prefix, but mostly a suffix. Also, in reference to his egg-theme, Tamago often uses egg-related puns. He refers to inexperienced people as \"half-boiled\" and when people surprise him with their ignorance, he even calls them \"raw\". When he says \"you\" he uses the kanji for \"egg yolk\" (?), as both are pronounced kimi. He is polite and negotiable, as well as rather intelligent, as he saw exchanging the treasure for some extra time to make more candy to be perfectly acceptable. Tamago even offered to give the citizens more time until they could accomplish the task (although the time he gave them was clearly insufficient compared to the situation explained). He even fully elaborated the protection Big Mom lent to Fish-Man Island in exchange for candy to the Straw Hats' \"Monster Trio\", along with the consequences of them failing to fulfill their end of the bargain. Like most of Big Mom's subordinates, Tamago is afraid of her. Tamago seems to dislike arrogance as shown when he admitted being disgusted by Caribou after Pekoms noted that Logia users who thought themselves to be invincible did not tend to live long. Ironically, he himself is subjected to displays of boasting as during his second fight against Pedro, he bragged about his superior speed compared to the mink's. After the misfortunes the Big Mom Pirates suffered since the Straw Hats arrived at Whole Cake Island, Niwatori became concerned of how they underestimated the Straw Hats and even warned Mont-d'Or that arrogance could lead to negative consequences. Tamago follows his missions to the letter, even at the expense of his partners, as he condoned Capone Bege's decision to shoot Pekoms because Pekoms was willing to let the Straw Hats go as thanks for their protection of Zou. Despite that, when finding out Pekoms survived and was on Whole Cake island, Tamago stated he intended to bring him before Big Mom and have the latter beg her for forgiveness while mentioning their past as comrades. That being said, Tamago is very loyal to Big Mom and her crew, and gets furious if anyone betrays them. He was furious when he found out about Bege's assassination plot against her, adding how he used to admire his skill, and was later shocked upon learning that Pekoms betrayed the crew to assist the Straw Hats' escape. Tamago also does not follow the popular trend of exposing and decorating his longlegs like other members of his tribe do.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tamago, like many others in the crew, is responsible for collecting candy payments from the various islands under Big Mom's protection, and is trusted by his captain enough to be assigned a knight rank. He is a very powerful man, given his bounty, and was able to emerge from a battle against Pedro, the captain of the Mink Tribe's Guardians with a bounty of 382,000,000, with only a scar on his left eye to show for it. Tamago is extremely strong, in contrast to his disproportionate, thin-limbed build. He was able to easily lift, with each of his thin arms, a sack larger than his own torso of gold and jewelry. As one of the Longleg Tribe, his legs are considered the main point of his combat strength and, at the same time, his weakness. He is capable of performing rapid kick attacks, horizontally spinning his legs in a whirlwind motion akin to a rolling cartwheel, which are powerful enough to send opponents crashing into walls. Due to his legs' length, his kicks have great range (superior, by his own word, to that of Pedro's sword strokes), and he is capable of clashing his legs directly against a blade with no apparent repercussions. He wears special tights that can protect him from electric attacks, particularly Electro. He is also quite agile, as he kept up with Pedro's own very impressive speed (all the while preventing the cup atop his head from spilling). Tamago ate the Tama Tama no Mi, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that makes his body composition like that of an egg; the external surface of his body is like an eggshell with a giant egg yolk inside. When his eggshell body takes significant damage, it will break like an egg. Once broken, Tamago will regenerate from the yolk, evolved into a stronger chicken-like form. He has three forms, Baron Tamago being his base form, Viscount Hiyoko which resembles a chick, and Count Niwatori which resembles a rooster. He is stated to become stronger in combat each time he regenerates and evolves, and is a \"true knight\" once he reaches his third form. Should his strongest form be destroyed, he reverts to his base form. This endless cycle effectively prevents him from dying in battle, as long as his yolk is not killed in the midst of an evolution. Tamago possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit and sword Abilities. He is highly skilled and experienced in swordsmanship as he is able to hold his own against Pedro, a powerful mink swordsman. Tamago uses his swordsmanship in conjunction with his leg attacks, providing a multifaceted offense. In the anime, Tamago's swordsmanship can be improved by evolving with his Devil Fruit powers. As Viscount Hiyoko, he has shown extreme proficiency and speed in dual wielding knives, able to corner Pedro and even disarm him of his sword. He is seen carrying a pistol on his right hip, and a shikomizue (cane sword) similar to Brook's. When he becomes Viscount Hiyoko, he wields two knives."},

Unlike a regular octopus, he has a turtle-like head without a beak between the arms. Surume has many tentacles, at least eighteen tentacles (more than double the number of a regular octopus) can be counted. Originally, Surume had a menacing look in his eyes and mouth, but after being tamed by Luffy, he was smiling and kind-looking.", "personality": "When the Straw Hats first encounter him on their way to Fish-Man Island, several crushed pirate ships can be seen among his massive tentacles, indicating that he feeds on the ships and crews he pulls down into the ocean. Caribou found it odd that a kraken would be living near the Red Line. Surume is actually quite intelligent, knowing a threat when he sees one, such as when he attempts to attack Luffy as he was preparing his Gear 3 attack, knowing that Luffy was a threat. His personality appears to be more playful than previously believed after Luffy tamed him, such as when he placed the Thousand Sunny on top of his head, and he seems to be able to understand human language. While he fears the New Fish-Man Pirates for taking him from the North Pole and holding his brothers, family, and species as hostages, he trusts Luffy enough to help fight against his former masters. He is also caring to those dear to him as he followed the New Fish-Man Pirates to prevent them from killing his species and seemed conflicted when he was forced to go against his friend, Luffy due to this situation, until Luffy promised him his brothers' safety. While Surume seems to be smart enough to understand human language and was able to sense danger, he is described by the New Fish-Man Pirates as a gigantic, super-strong, super-stupid octopus; though they were rather biased from their view of fish-men alone as the superior race.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to Surume's size, he has shown himself to be very powerful, with his tentacles long enough to crush several ships with one swipe. He was also shown destroying a ship bigger than the Thousand Sunny without any effort and knocked out Wadatsumi with just one punch. He was called the \"Monster of the Arctic\" by captain Vander Decken IX, and Hody Jones brought him from the North Pole to be a slave, needing to use his family as hostages to get his cooperation. Like an ordinary octopus, he can regrow severed tentacles. Apparently, this ability to regenerate seems remarkably quick, evident since Zoro reduced at least one tentacle to strips, only for Surume to appear once again with all of his tentacles intact after being tamed by Luffy."},

Her monocle is pink with a purple lens.", "personality": "She is loyal to Doflamingo and helped him take over the kingdom of Dressrosa. She is shown to be cruel, turning many citizens into toys and subjugating them into slavery, leaving them forgotten by anyone who knew them. She took great pride in what she did, as she was angry when the toys returned to their original forms and intended to exact her revenge. However, she still seems to have some degree of empathy as she looked a bit saddened upon seeing the dwarves' hopelessly nave faith in Usoland despite him having seemingly abandoned them to their fate, indicating that she felt pity for them. She has shown signs of childish behavior, as demonstrated when she ran around the palace, looking for Doflamingo, after he had already left for Punk Hazard. Sugar appears to be fairly indifferent about the events that happen around her, as she showed no reaction when Baby 5 attacked Doflamingo. However, she happens to have a weak fortitude, as she became utterly terrified after she forced Usopp to eat the extra-spicy Tatababasco-laced grape, at which point he made a horrifying visage of pain that scared Sugar into unconsciousness. As a result of this, she became terrified of long noses and things that looked like long noses, becoming scared when a long nosed soldier offered her some sausage. She is also capable of expressing shock, like when Trebol smashed a ship through the tower or got creeped out at the hands that sprouted on her and held her. She is smart and perceptive as upon seeing the Tontattas confronting her, she immediately realized that the dwarves were with someone else in the tower as they were quickly able of figuring out her lies in spite of their gullibility, and deduced that the dwarves had been up to something over the last year as they had not come to the palace during this time. Sugar has a fondness for grapes, which are apparently her favorite food. She often eats them off her fingers. She is shown to be quite rude to Trebol, despite the latter being in charge of her protection. She seems to be annoyed when people consider her weak due to her child-like appearance, to the point where she (literally) drops everything to show off her strength. In spite of her appearance, Sugar is highly self-assured, confident in her abilities. She got annoyed when the dwarves charged at her because of her child-like appearance, and took it upon herself to turn most of them into toys. She even stepped in to save Doflamingo from Kyros by turning him into a toy. However, she does not seem to mind having support, as she did not mind having Trebol when facing against the remaining dwarves and Usopp. She is cunning, capable of using her childish appearance by putting up a facade of innocence to lure people in so she could turn them into toys. Sugar is capable of crying on cue and pretending to offer Luffy and Law grapes as a trap, and this would have succeeded if Usopp had not sniped a plant that traumatized her again. Sugar's confidence and pride tend to border on overconfidence and a bit of arrogance that caused the downfall of not only her but also Doflamingo. When Usopp was on the verge of unconsciousness, Sugar refused to return to the castle and fed him the Tatababasco-laced grape, which led to Usopp making a horrifying visage that scared Sugar into unconsciousness, causing not only the toys to revert back to their original forms but also revealed Doflamingo's tyranny for over 10 years.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had a high level of authority in the crew. Despite her child-like physique and having Trebol as her bodyguard, Sugar is quite formidable in terms of speed and agility, as seen when she countered a number of attacking Tontatta dwarves, who can move fast enough that normal humans cannot see them. However, she has a rather weak constitution, as she freaked out and lost consciousness when Usopp made a horrifying visage of pain and anguish after being force-fed the Tatababasco-laced grape. This became her weakness, because whenever she sees anything that even remotely reminds her of Usopp's terrifyingexpression, she may suffer a flashback that could cause her to faint. Sugar ate the Hobi Hobi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows her to transform any living creature she touches into a subservient living toy. When someone gets transformed into a toy, their existence is completely erased from the memory of everyone who ever knew them. This fruit also stopped her aging process, causing her to physically remain a child. After turning someone into a toy, she has to create a contract with them and set rules for them to follow. A toy has no choice but to obey all of the conditions that Sugar has ordered them to follow, leaving them helplessly trapped in their toy bodies. If she fails to make said contract, then the toy will keep its free will. If Sugar is ever knocked unconscious, then all the individuals she turned into toys will revert back into their original selves. Given how many people were transformed, it could prove disastrous to her and the rest of her crew."},

Despite his sickly constitution, Stronger has great endurance, being completely submerged in Magellan's deadly venom and also took a shockwave attack from Sengoku. Stronger ate the Uma Uma no Mi, Model: Pegasus, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a Pegasus hybrid and a full Pegasus at will. Since he is already a horse, this power basically just allows him to grow wings and fly.

He has a beak-like nose, big lips, and a large mustache shaped like a clover on each end. He wears a pink button-down shirt with a light apron under it, as well as dark pink pants, a yellow scarf, and a very large hat with a big feather attached to it. He also keeps a stopwatch on his left hip. At age 29, he lacked a mustache, and his hair was black. He wore a dark blue buttoned shirt, a grayish green cape, a yellow bandanna around his neck, and a large dark blue brimmed hat with a white feathered plume sticking out of it.", "personality": "Streusen has a great penchant for operatic singing, as he frequently sings in a deep and flowy manner be it when preparing food while doing his job as a chef or celebrating important occasions such as weddings, and can get emotional while doing so. The lyrics of his songs suggest that he views life as cruel, and full of hardships,so people should eat sweetcakes torelieve their suffering. He also displayed modesty when Big Mom praised his culinary skills. As a younger man, Streusen appearedto be power-hungry and intuitive, as he quickly deduced that a young Charlotte Linlin could help him rise back to power and so worked with her to ensure he got what he wanted, giving Linlin anything she wanted in return. This was born out of a sense of sadism, as Streusen became interested in her when she committed a horrific action that he found amusing. He was also cautious, as he maintained a distance from Linlin when first approaching her, after witnessing her actions that he found amusing. Streusen also cares for the safety of both the citizens of Totto Land and members of his crew, as he instinctively turned the Whole Cake Chateau into a cake to soften its impact as it collapsed and at the same time cushion the people affected. He is against encouraging violent behavior in children as he refused to give knives to Anana. In the anime, Streusen was enthusiastic when a juvenile Linlin uses her ferocious powers for crime in the past. Like many characters in One Piece he has a distinct laugh: \"Kukukuku\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Streusen shows a tremendous amount of leadership and guidance skills, being able to guide a team of chefs to craft an immensely intricate wedding cake, and influence Linlin into the infamous pirate she is today. Streusen possesses a strong will, enough to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud screams. According to Capone Bege, Streusen may be a powerful fighter. Despite being nearly a century old, Streusen has exceptional endurance, as he survived a hard fall to the ground from the top of the Whole Cake Chateau, though he was rendered badly injured and incapacitated in the process. Streusen is also fast, as he ran across on the outer walls of the castle. As their executive chef, Streusen is in charge of all of the Big Mom Pirates' cooks. He is renowned as an outstanding master chef with more than 60 years of culinary experience. He could give commands to his subordinate chefs to prepare and bake a gigantic wedding cake of very refined culinary craftsmanship with intricate designs of skulls, crosses, roses, and even a large wedding altar. Even Big Mom holds his culinary skills in high regards. He hasalso been noted to be the only one who could remake the wedding cake that hadbeen destroyed by Luffy. The WCI 31, who are the finest head chefs of Totto Land, held utmost respect for Streusen's skills and were shocked that Sanji actually succeeded in figuring out Streusen's newly designed secret recipe.Chiffon notes that despiteStreusen'spreeminent cookingprowess, Sanji's cooking skills are on a higher level. He is also a very skilled opera singer. While he was preparing the wedding cake, he sang NON SUGAR LIFE in an elegant and moving tone that caused his subordinate chefs to respond emotionally, and during Sanji and Pudding's wedding ceremony, he led a makeshift choir consisting of some of his subordinate chefs to sing a melodious love song. Streusen wields a cutlass, and was shown using it in conjunction with his Devil Fruit power. Streusen is a highly proficient and powerful swordsman. With a single slash, he could slice the massive top of the transformed Whole Cake Chateau to safely land the Big Mom Pirates. Streusen ate the Kuku Kuku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to turn any object into food. By plunging his sword into an object, even an incredibly massive object, such as an entire castle, it becomes any kind of food of Streusen's choosing. The food he creates with this ability does provide nourishment, but it does not taste good. In addition to being able to feed himself and others, he can use this power to make things less dangerous, such as by transforming a large falling object into something soft, like sponge cake."},

Like many high-ranking Marines, he has a standard Marine's coat draped on his shoulders like a cape. Under it, and over a shirt left unbuttoned near the neck, he wears a water-green jacket, with pale yellowrope-like ornaments on the chest, and matching pants. Ten years ago, his beard was very thin and his eyes were half-closed.

He is also usually seen with a calm expression.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine vice admiral, Strawberry is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside other vice admirals. He also has authority over lower-ranking subordinates. Due to the large size of his head, he has very strong headbutts. Strawberry was shown holding two identical swords with Japanese-looking hilts wrapped in a pink material. They have elongated hand-guards decorated by red gems, just like the rounded pommels, and blades with more of a curve than those of katanas. He wields both of them in reverse, similar to Doma.

He appears to have great respect for Paulie. In the anime, he is known to eavesdrop and gossip, as he tried to see who was boarding the Sea Train for Enies Lobby, but was stopped by World Government officials. He also tends to come to the wrong conclusions about events in Water 7 because of the nature of gossiping itself. He believed a group of thugs in the backstreets was responsible for the destruction of Galley-La headquarters, mistook Sanji's letter for Nami in Blue Station as a failed love confession from Paulie in the midst of a love triangle, and thought that when Nami had them go collect food and drinks for the crew, it was all for her and she had a big appetite as a growing woman."},

Stussy appears younger than her actual age, with short curly blonde hair, blue eyes, red lipstick, and red-painted fingernails she has a thin and slightly curved body as well as exceptionally large breasts. As an agent of CP0, she wears a uniform consisting of a white dress with a pink necktie, white matching cape and gloves. She also dons fishnet stockings with fluffy rims and a garter belt. When she attended the recent Tea Party as an emperor of the Underworld, she wore a salmon colored dress with a purple end, with pink diamond patterns on the bottom, a small white cape, a sunhat with a flower on it, and high heels shoes with ribbons on top. She also carried a pink handbag with her. As a CP0 agent, she wears a mask in the form of a hood that covers the head and eyes, resembling an owl. During the Egghead Arc, Stussy is shown wearing a bright colored leotard bodysuit, dark colored jacket with a hood, along with gloves, an earpiece and DOM Shoes.", "personality": "Stussy possesses a sadistic side, which was shown when she shot down Du Feld, even stating she will have him take the blame for her actions. She also threatened an eavesdropping Morgans to create a fake story in order to cover up her and the World Government's actions. She does show a certain level of caution when she agrees to Kaku's suggestion that they cannot fight one of the Four Emperors without being granted permission from the World Government. Stussy has shown to be quite practical when it comes to fighting, as she prefers to incapacitate her enemies at once rather than fight them as shown when she incapacitated Kaku and Lucci. Of course, she did admit fighting them head on would have been stupid and given the situation, she simply picked the more effective method. In her Underworld emperor persona, she acted polite and disapproved of insults being thrown around, in contrast to her occasionally more hostile fellow emperors. However, she was sensitive about her age and would get violent if it was brought up. She sometimes speaks in a flirty tone.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a successful clone of a former member of the legendary and formidable Rocks Pirates, Stussy likely shares the same physical power and skills of the original Stussy. Being a former masked agent of CP0, the strongest and most exclusive of the Cipher Pols, her abilities are highly recognize by the World Government. Stussy possesses the ability to generate bat-like wings from her back and can suck blood from people by biting into their skin, akin to a vampire; she can quickly incapacitate people whose blood she sucks by putting them to sleep. She can even incapacitate powerful assassins like Rob Lucci and Kaku, the latter in his awakened form. The source of this ability is currently unknown. Stussy also possesses considerable willpower, as she was able to withstand a Haoshoku Haki blast from Big Mom. Stussy is a master spy with incredible infiltration skills, being a former secret agent of CP0. She was able to climb the ranks of the Underworld until becoming one of its emperors. As such, Stussy has some degree of power over it, and she is important enough to be invited to the Emperor Big Mom's tea parties. Furthermore, Stussy was Dr. Vegapunk's spy the whole time yet manage to go undetected for 20 years until she betrayed her former colleague during the Egghead Incident. An impressive feat given Rob Lucci and Kaku are highly trained spies themselves and have done something similar in the past, yet neither suspected a thing. She was also instinctive enough to notice Morgans eavesdropping on her. Being a former agent of CP0, the strongest of Cipher Pol, Stussy possesses superior superhuman strength. With a single finger thrust, she can produce a concentrated shockwave powerful enough to pierce Du Feld, a large man, from a considerable distance, knocking him unconscious. Stussy is also extremely fast, as shown during her fight with Rob Lucci she moved so fast, leaving an afterimage which he attack and quickly grab him after with ease. As a former agent of Cipher Pol, Stussy has fully mastered the Rokushiki martial arts. Being part of the Masked Assassins of CP0 along with Rob Lucci and Kaku, her masterly is likely higher than most agents. She can use Tobu Shigan, a more powerful variation of Shigan, to pierce Du Feld from a distance, and was also shown using Geppo to escape the collapsing chateau. Stussy can also use a variation of Kami-e to dodge at high speed, leaving an afterimage behind her. This technique can fool a Rokushiki master of Rob Lucci's caliber. Stussy possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Stussy possesses a lipstick tube with a small block of Seastone in it."},

He developed a hatred towards Roger for killing his old crew, and this hatred extended to Roger's son, Ace. Squard felt betrayed when he found out all of this, and due to this shock and hatred, the then Admiral Akainu was easily able to deceive Squard into thinking that Whitebeard was plotting to betray all of his subordinate crews.

As an adult, Sterry still acts rudely to people of lower status and acts spoiled, as he complained about his lavish living quarters in Loguetown. He even treated the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp rudely because Garp was a citizen of his kingdom, and was aghast when Garp insulted him. However, Sterry can put up a facade of good manners and devotion in front of his adoptive parents. Although Sterry's teacher and adoptive parents stated that he was extremely intelligent when he was a child (though by their noble standards), he seems to be extremely ignorant about much of the world, with his views on other races being mainly based on racist stereotypes and rumors. He considers fish-men and merfolk to be no more than fish and believes they have a contagious disease, and mistook Neptune as a giant, who he believed ate humans and had saliva that could melt rocks. He has a condescending attitude around the royalty of Fish-Man Island, silently mocking their decision to explore the forests of Mary Geoise, viewing it as an ignorance of human amenities. He is also not very brave, crying in fear when Sabo threatened him, and shunning any responsibilities when Sabo ran away again. As an adult, he shrunk back in fear upon seeing a flock of crows near his bondola, worrying they could send him plummeting down the Red Line.

The beard has also grown into a long and sharp goatee, and he had a small toothbrush mustache. His face has wrinkled from time as well. He changed his coat to a white one. Overall, he bears some resemblance to his son, Spandam.", "personality": "He, like his son, is a coward. Spandine was proud of his rank and enjoyed stepping on the heads of \"criminals\". He is very self-centered and did not care about anything or anyone else other than himself, and he used his power to do whatever he wanted. He believes everything he does is right and is extremely loyal to the Five Elders. Spandine believed himself to be special, and nearly invincible, because he's a Government agent. He saw himself like a hero, but acted like a child. A very bossy and mean person, he intends to get his job done and always begged for promotions. He laughed when the time came to unleash the Buster Call on Ohara, and thought that activating the Buster Call would get him promoted. It should be noted that, unlike his son, he cared for his subordinates and considered what was best for them as shown when he was shocked that the Buster Call had started before they got off and then ordering them to get off the island while stating that their lives were more important than the prisoner's. Spandine is quite dramatic; when Nico Olvia shot him, he thought he was going to die. He begged his agents to report to the boss and give the position he held to his son, only to be told that the bullet went through his sleeve.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former chief of CP9, Spandine had authority over some of the strongest agents in the World Government. In addition, shortly before the Ohara Incident, he was given authority by then Admiral Sengoku to invoke a Buster Call. Spandine does not seem to possess any abilities comparable to that of a CP9 agent. When Nico Olvia fired at his sleeve, he thought he was already defeated and was going to die. He does not fight and orders his colleagues to fight in his place."},

He is quick to judge, as when he first saw Luffy (as Lucy), he immediately considered him a weakling who was unworthy to compete in the Colosseum.

{"name": "Spandam", "episode": "Episode 355", "chapter": "Chapter 249", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Spandam is a pale man of slim stature with wavy, wild lavender hair in a layered style that is roughly shoulder-length and parted in the middle. He has black markings around his large eyes, and his narrow nose is a dark red, which leads to Franky's nickname for him, \"Spanda\". He is fond of leather, and wears a brown studded leather mask which covers the bridge of his nose and scars on his moderately high forehead just above his eyebrows, similar to the mask of the WWE Legend Mick Foley, or \"Mankind\". He also has a strong chin from when Franky attacked him eight years ago, as well as long brown leather gloves and a black high-collared leather vest with matching pants separated by a studded belt. He has white shoes with brown tassels extending from their heels, and wears a long-sleeved light gray shirt decorated with a diagonal squiggle pattern below his vest with the collar turned up. His face is very expressive, and he has a large smile that causes his slightly angular eyebrows to narrow in slightly. Two years later, Spandam's wounds have completely healed. He wears lighter clothes, a bowler hat, a striped vest, and a feathery coat. In Franky's flashback, Spandam's nose, not yet broken, was slightly longer, and his strong jawline was more pronounced. He wore a long black coat with gold-colored trim and the World Government symbol with oversized shoulder pads, a white shirt with a black tie, a gray vest with corset lacing and a diagonal squiggle pattern identical to that on his shirt eight years later, black pants and shoes, and short brown gloves. His hair was partially slicked back, emphasizing the prominent widow's peak on his high forehead, and he had small sideburns. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Based on these illustrations, it seems Spandam had a small elephant as a pet when he was a child.", "personality": "Spandam is very clumsy (he tends to spill coffee on himself during moments of excitement) and short tempered, with special sensitivity towards his name. Franky's nickname for him, Spanda (due to his panda-like markings around the eyes and nose), always causes him to lose his head. As a result, Spandam comes off mostly as a comedic villain like Buggy, though he often reveals real malice when gloating over his prisoners - as seen when he broke his promise of the Straw Hat Pirates' safety, and proceeded to beat on his defenseless captive, Nico Robin. He is not detached from the idea of exploitation, backstabbing, or the use of loopholes to get his own way, as he has proven many times in the past. Spandam is also very sadistic as seen by how he treated Nico Robin. Ironically, Spandam (as a World Government figure) is also victim to the government fabricated lie that Robin is evil and intent on world destruction. Most likely this idea was put in his head by his father Spandine. Spandam is also a great believer of Absolute Justice and believes that the end justifies the means, with the end being the acquisition of the Ancient Weapons and the means being as many murders or sacrifices as it takes. He sees himself as the world's greatest hero for capturing Robin, and is very interested in his rank and prestige, often coming across as extremely power-hungry, even contemplating using the weapons' power for his own benefit, instead of the world's - unlike the other agents, who do not want any recognition whatsoever. He has no consideration for the lives of others at all and does not even consider the loss of innocents, only having power at his command. He likes plans to go perfectly fine and gets annoyed when they do not. Spandam's main character trait is his cowardly outlook on life - even when he does not display his cowardice, he is constantly thinking about such things. He is confident only when he feels safe because he has no strength, seeing as he has a Doriki of 9 - an average Marine has 10, so he relies on others to protect him. Thus to this end, every move that he made throughout the Enies Lobby Arc was a move to put his safety above all others. Moreover, though the fault for the destruction of Enies Lobby falls solely in his hands, he uses the members of the CP9 as his scapegoats to avoid the blame being pinned on him. Though this granted him some protection, he made enemies of his former co-workers. He appears to underestimate the strength of pirates and overestimate the strength of Marines, as once he heard a transmission saying that Luffy had defeated 500 marines, he is quoted as saying: \"500? The soldiers aren't that weak!\" He also accused the Straw Hats of stealing all the keys to Nico Robin's handcuffs, instead of beating up all CP9 agents to get them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Spandam is the least powerful of the group as he has a Doriki level of only 9 (a normal, armed marine has a Doriki level of 10). Being this way, he is incapable of learning and knowing any Rokushiki moves. Nonetheless, the rest of the Cipher Pol 9 do not mind and \"respect\" him as the chief of the organization, with the possible exception of Kumadori, as he was the only one who saved Spandam from being beaten further by Franky (sending Spandam flying into the ceiling in the process). Because of his physical weakness, Spandam relies on his natural talents of knowledge and deception, as opposed to actual combat. However, despite his physical weakness, he appears to be capable of enduring considerably high amounts of damage, as seen when he was still standing after two attacks from Usopp (as Sogeking), Robin's \"Seis Fleur: Slap\", and Franky's \"Strong Right\" (in Franky's case, he also instantly counter-attacked), which only seemed to swell his face, as well as having Funkfreed land on top of him after Franky threw the elephant at him. Despite the enormous amounts of crippling damage he suffered at their hands, which left him bedridden, he managed to make a full recovery, enough to join CP0 two years later. Spandam also has many contacts, which is the reason why he was able to get hold of two Devil Fruits easily. Spandam's main offense is his special sword, \"Funkfreed\", which somehow absorbed a Devil Fruit, Zou Zou no Mi. Using this fruit, it can turn into an elephant. Funkfreed also makes up for Spandam's weakness by being both his weapon and bodyguard. Spandam shows a slight amount of skill in swordsmanship, to the extent of being able to cleanly slice through a metal lantern with glass panels (despite immediately getting burnt by the candle that fell afterwards). While transferring Nico Robin trough the Gates of Justice at Enies Lobby, he used a land mine on the Bridge of Hesitation's first support at the top of the stairs."},

Queen considers her to be very beautiful, and states that she is his second choice for a partner behind only Komurasaki.", "personality": "Some is a meek woman who was quick to apologize for getting in Sanji's way, not wanting to be mistaken for a combatant in the war on Onigashima. When she was attacked by Queen (with Sanji appearing to be the perpetrator at the time), Some was shown with a look of great fear on her face. She is also shown to be quite caring, and will be courageous to help those she cares about in danger, seen when she went into a battle area to find and rescue her pet mouse Chuji. Although she displays great reverence toward the Wano administration and occupying Beasts Pirates as is required, Some has rejected the romantic advances of Queen numerous times in spite of the great power the All-Star holds.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a geisha who was summoned from the Flower Capital to perform at Kurozumi Orochi and Kaidou's Fire Festival celebration, it is likely that Some is a very skilled entertainer.

She is able to use her extra arms to grab more objects than a normal person would be able to. With the abilities granted by her Devil Fruit, Solitaire wields four swords with her bottom four arms. Her skill with them is unknown, as she has not been seen using them. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, she was able to use her swords to cut through solid rock. She demonstrates enough skill to face Raizo for a short period.

Smiley was able to subdivide into smaller slimes, however, the smaller slimes did not take on the shape of axolotls.", "personality": "Smiley did not seem to have any understanding of its actions, as it continuously moved forward after being released and even killed some of Caesar's men in the process. It did know, however, that it was weak to water and figured out a way to avoid it, by propelling little parts of itself over the body of water. Smiley also responded to verbal commands from Caesar and followed them right away. However, Smiley sometimes ignored Caesar if it was interested in something else.", "abilities_and_powers": "Smiley would constantly emit some kind of smoke or vapor, which would poison people that inhaled or touched it. It was also very corrosive, causing great pain on its own. Despite its composition, it appeared to move rather fast, as some of Caesar's men could not escape from it, despite them being centaurs. Due to its large size, it is very hard to avoid or escape from it. Smiley also appeared to be immune to extreme heat, as it could freely move over the scorching ground in the Burning Lands without any trouble. It could also shoot pieces of itself called Smilies (, Sumairzu?) in order to cross a lake or other body of water, as it was weak to water. Even though it was immune to extreme heat, setting its body directly on fire would cause it to explode violently. Caesar once used this to his advantage by having the pieces latch onto his opponent and igniting them. Smiley consumed the Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit which allowed it to take on the form of an axolotl. It is also what gave Smiley life and sentience.

{"name": "Smoker", "episode": "Episode 97", "chapter": "Chapter 48", "year": 1998, "note": "He is formally introduced in Chapter 98.", "appearance": "Smoker is a muscular, white-haired (light teal in the pre-timeskip anime) and brown-eyed man, with a distinct trait of always being seen smoking two cigars at once. His eyes sometimes appear red, such as during the Punk Hazard arc. He wears a large thick white and blue specialist marine jacket which he keeps open, with greenish fur lining the neck, wrists, and hem. The jacket bears the kanji for \"justice\" (, Seigi?) written on the back of it. Many cigars are strapped to the jacket. He carries a Seastone-tipped jitte as his weapon, although it has been broken twice: once during the Summit War of Marineford by Boa Hancock, and once on Punk Hazard by Vergo. He also wears brown leather gloves, blue jeans with a brown belt, and large military-issue brown leather boots. Furthermore, during his time in Arabasta, he also sported goggles. The fact that he rides a custom-made motorbike gives off the impression of a delinquent marine. In the manga, his hair has a white tone and the fur on his coat was initially blue, later changed to dark green, and ultimately modified to follow the anime, albeit with a much lighter green tone, and with green zips as well. During his stay on an unknown island of the Grand Line, he was seen without his jacket, which he had a subordinate carry for him. During this time, he was seen keeping his jitte strapped to his back via a series of belts. A scar was visible on the right side of his chest. After the timeskip, his hair is now longer, slicked back, and the sides have been shaved. He now sports a pair of sunglasses. He has a scar that extends from his forehead to his right eye and tapers off to the side of his face. He also added the traditional Marines' military coat over his attire, draped over his shoulders like a cape with his jitte, which has either been replaced or repaired since the Summit War of Marineford, hanging on the back; he is one of the few high-ranking marines (more specifically, a vice admiral) to not wear a conventional suit. As a child, he sported the same hairstyle as his pre-timeskip appearance. His face is depicted as being dirty, with a runny nose and a bandage on his forehead, looking as if he just had a brawl with someone. He wore a plain blank white shirt and had a pair of goggles around his neck. He wore a pair of simple black pants and a pair of simple black boots. He also wore a pair of mittens or boxing gloves and carried around a baseball bat with nails in it, and was accompanied by an exhausted-looking dog. During his time as a cadet, his hair was styled into a classic military buzz cut, and he was already smoking cigars, though only had one in his mouth at a time. In One Piece: Stampede, he wears an unbuttoned white shirt, black pants with a pink sash tied around his waist, and brown boots. He also wears a black pirate captain jacket, with the red inside.", "personality": "Smoker is a seasoned Marine soldier, infamous among his organization for his loose cannon tendencies and obstinate, rebellious attitude towards even his superiors. Many times in the series, Smoker comes in conflict with his higher ups, usually due to disagreeing with their methods of upholding peace and justice by covering up the truth or not crediting those who deserve it. Even something beneficial to his reputation, such as an award or promotion, will cause Smoker to lash out against the top brass, especially if he feels like he did not earn it. However, Smoker does show interest in climbing up the ranks, if only to widen his authority to act freely. Unlike many other marines in One Piece, Smoker does not follow the rule of Absolute Justice, following his own personal code of justice instead, which he later preaches to his subordinate Tashigi. This perception of justice allows Smoker to be flexible regarding who he can view as an ally or not, depending on the circumstances and what he witnesses during them. The Straw Hat Pirates are perhaps the biggest example of this, as whenever they meet, the Marine and the pirates often have a greater enemy in common, so Smoker lets them run free or even outright joins forces with them for the sake of saving innocents. However, as a Marine, Smoker frequently warns the Straw Hats that he will arrest them at any other time, in accordance with his duty. Smoker is an extremely serious and gruff man, and has very rarely been shown to smile, if at all. He is often sharp and caustic towards people who come off as nuisances to him, and gets irritated at silly or stupid antics that disturb his peace. However, he is profoundly dedicated and driven to protecting innocent people and his subordinates from harm. Smoker treats his underlings with the same respect as his peers and never abuses his position for selfish purposes, unlike several high-ranking marines. Despite his somber manners, Smoker does seem to have a benevolent personality, particularly regarding children and civilians. Smoker is merciless against pirates, usually taking a straightforward but efficient approach in capturing them. He is dedicated to the pursuit of global justice against criminals, and never forgets those who forsake the law and manage to escape his grasp, though he recognizes that not all Marines are as noble as their image suggests, nor should all allies be trusted blindly. Smoker holds a rather cynical worldview that makes him question even the Marines, considering the existence of traitors within their ranks a likely possibility. He also does not trust the Seven Warlords of the Sea despite their status as employees of the World Government, as he believes them to be nothing more than pirates (according to him, \"once a pirate, always a pirate\"), meaning that Smoker rarely leaves them to their own devices. This is exacerbated by the fact that Smoker has confronted no less than four different warlords for various reasons, often for knowing too much about their machinations. Smoker tends to hold grudges toward pirates who have escaped him, to the point of ignoring other notable pirates in his way. For example, he recognized Portgas D. Ace, a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, and was ready to confront him in battle, but after Monkey D. Luffy unexpectedly interrupted them, Smoker barely acknowledged Ace's presence and started chasing the Straw Hat captain, who he considers his primary target ever since their scuffle at Loguetown. It is worth noting that Smoker's interest in Luffy goes deeper than just that; Smoker has witnessed parallels between Gold Roger and the young pirate, such as a defiant smile in the face of death as well as seemingly miraculous luck. As can be deduced from his name, Smoker is an avid smoker, almost never being seen without at least one cigar on his mouth. He also instinctively prefers to walk around with his chest bare, doing so even after having his mind transferred to the body of a woman. Smoker seems to have a hobby in rock balancing. As such, he does not seem to like when people make too much noise around him, as he claims that it breaks his focus.", "abilities_and_powers": "Smoker is a formidable combatant, as on top of his sheer strength, his Logia Devil Fruit abilities set him apart from most Marines of his rank. Before Luffy came, it was said that pirate activity in Loguetown had dropped down significantly since Smoker's arrival, a testament to his competency. In Loguetown, he was on the verge of arresting Luffy during their first encounter, and would have succeeded had it not been for Luffy's father, Monkey D. Dragon, interfering. As a result, Luffy resorted to running away from Smoker every time he spotted him due to not yet knowing how to use Busoshoku Haki. After the Enies Lobby events, Smoker was shown unsatisfied in capturing a pirate with a bounty of 50,000,000 and already considered moving to the New World. During the Summit War of Marineford, he again defeated Luffy, who was already a supernova, effortlessly and could have captured him; if it weren't for Hancock's interference. By the end of the Summit War of Marineford, Smoker's overall strength had granted him enough confidence to request a transfer to the G-5 Marine Branch in the New World. It was said that the soldiers of this branch were insane, cruel, and merciless, regularly torturing pirates through various methods. They were known for not following orders, but Smoker, who is very much similar, managed to earn their loyalty and obedience, to the point of worship. With Vergo's treason and death, Smoker took over as base commander, effectively becoming the highest authority within the branch. Smoker's skills in pursuing and ensnaring enemies are regarded as top-notch, being the source of his \"White Hunter\" moniker. Luffy being the first person to ever escape his clutches is what causes him to fearlessly tackle more dangerous seas. After the time skip, Smoker and his crew managed to capture several pirates who were liberated from Hody's control at once. During his time on Punk Hazard, he managed to give Trafalgar Law, a Warlord of the Sea and part of the Worst Generation, a hard time in combat before he was ultimately defeated. He also fought fellow his fellow vice admiral, Vergo, who is also one of the strongest members of the Donquixote Pirates, on relatively equal terms, despite Vergo's superior mastery of Haki, although in the end he was defeated. Even after having his mind switched to Tashigi's body, Smoker managed to strike Luffy, surprising the Straw Hat captain, who wondered how \"Tashigi\" had gotten so strong since two years ago. Also, despite not being in his original body, Smoker easily defeated some of Caesars subordinates through his normal skills alone. Smoker has both excellent hearing and memory, best shown during the Arabasta Arc, where he was able to identify a certain Bananawani from a whole pack solely by memorizing its growl. While he may not look like it, Smoker is a clever and intelligent interrogator, easily tricking Mr. 11 into revealing his affiliation to Baroque Works through deceit. Being highly observant, Smoker was the only one who noticed the unusual icebergs that blocked their path during their trip to Punk Hazard, and was suspicious of the ever present gas that lingers around the island, both of which were being manipulated by the enemy. As a leader and strategist, Smoker is extremely efficient at his job, mobilizing his forces in a clear and concise manner during times of crisis. As evident by his strong build, Smoker possesses incredible physical strength. During his confrontation with Luffy in Loguetown, he was able to jump about two stories high without difficulty while holding the pirate and pin him down so that unable to retaliate, a noteworthy feat considering Luffy's superhuman physical power. He also has vast durability and resistance. Smoker was able to stand back up with no visible damage and without effort after receiving a Haki-enhanced kick from Boa Hancock, whose attacks were strong enough to shatter stone and Pacifista armor (though Hancock's kick was primarily to get him off of Luffy). After the time skip, Smoker's physical strength has become significantly more powerful, being able to grab Law's neck with one hand, slice through a rock twice his size with a single blow, and elbow blood out of his partner, Vergo. His stamina and durability also improved as he can take a lot of Vergo's haki-enhanced hits and keep fighting. Smoker ate the Moku Moku no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control and transform his body into smoke. He can manipulate the smoke's density, even to the point of solidifying it, allowing him to hold and constrict others within it. Like most Logia users, he can fly by turning his lower body into smoke and propelling himself like a rocket. He can use his smoke to surround his opponents to trap and/or bind them. Due to smoke being a gas, it has high maneuverability and irregular movements, allowing him to easily cover the battlefield in smoke as his opponents pointlessly try to escape it. Once his smoke is surrounding his enemies, he can increase its density, turning it solid and restraining his victims. He can also use his smoke as a blunt weapon. He can shoot powerful jets of smoke at his opponents to strike them with great force. Using his smoke powers, Smoker can power up the engines of his motorbike, the Billower Bike, for ground transportation. Smoker's main weapon is a large jitte that is tipped with Seastone, a material that affects Devil Fruit users in a similar way to the sea, which he uses to subdue criminal Devil Fruit users. Since only the tip is Seastone, it does not affect Smoker himself. He keeps the tip hanging in the air at all times, and his thick clothing provides further protection. When he turns into smoke, the weapon does not turn into smoke with him because of the Seastone. Instead, he carries it with him while in smoke form. Smoker seems to be very proficient in wielding the jitte, taking enemies by surprise and using the weapon to deliver strong blunt attacks. The jitte was broken in half when Boa Hancock kicked it, which led it to crumble. After the timeskip, the jitte has shown to have been repaired. Its hilt is white in the manga, but red in the anime. Also, in the manga and its related merchandise and products, it seems to be much longer than in the anime, almost reaching down to Smoker's feet. The Billower Bike is used for ground transportation. It is a wide bike with three wheels (two large ones at the rear, and a smaller one in front) and its engines are powered by his Moku Moku no Mi powers. Additionally, Smoker can traverse water with the bike. Before the timeskip, Smoker was not able to use Haki, although he had some knowledge of it. This put him at a disadvantage against the Warlord of the Sea Boa Hancock, who had mastery of the ability and could counter his Logia nature. During the timeskip, Smoker was promoted to vice admiral, confirming that he can use the ability. Smoker possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. During his battle with Vergo, he landed a punch where his hand and part of his arm were completely black, demonstrating the use of Hardening. He later did the same with his elbow when striking Vergo in the face. He can also imbue his Nanashaku Jitte with Haki, enhancing the strength of its strikes. Smoker possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki, as he sensed that Tashigi's Haki was not strong enough to counter Law's ability."},

His attire is composed of an orange fur-lined jacket, with brown swollen sleeves decorated by beige spots; loose matching orange pants held up by a belt, fur-lined gloves and boots, and a purple scarf around his neck. He's dark haired, and on his back there is a pair of typical wings, a standard feature of all the inhabitants of Skypiea. He carries his weapon of choice, a jousting lance, powered by a Heat Dial, and is almost always seen riding his pet giant bird, Fuza.", "personality": "Like all the other priests, Shura is confident in his abilities, and willing to kill every transgressor. Despite his proven cruelty, he has shown some moments of apparent pity and understanding, such as when he was talking to Chopper, even referring to him with his first name.

The animal has a Flame Dial in his mouth, and so has the ability of breathing fire. Shura is also exceptionally durable, having survived being struck by a Reject Dial at point blank though he was knocked unconscious, while the same attack temporarily killed his superior Enel by stopping his heart. Shura was the priest in charge of testing intruders with the Ordeal of String, which had a survival rate of 3%. The area where the Ordeal took place was filled up with long, almost invisible strands of String Cloud, which slowly trapped the transgressors, making them unable to move, and helpless against Shura's attacks. Shura is one of the priests, making him one of the strongest fighters under the command of Enel. He fights with a spear called Heat Javelin, which has a Heat Dial inside it, granting incendiary capabilities to the weapon, which burns whatever it strikes. Shura has the ability known as Kenbunshoku Haki, but in the sky islands it is known as \"Mantra\".

When angry, her eyes take on an ominous appearance and she shows sharp teeth. She has short black hair that covers over the right side of her face. Her tail is dark blue with a dorsal fin on her lower back where her human and fish halves meet, a white patch below the dorsal fin, smaller fins on the lower front and back, and a lunate caudal fin. Uniquely, the dorsal of her fish attribute is the front of her tail, with the usual ventral attribute facing the back. She wears a hooded purple blouse that is only buttoned in the middle, revealing her cleavage and stomach and has a belly-chain around her waist. She is often seen smoking a pipe. As a child, she wore a light-colored hooded dress with a stripe down the side. However, the anime showed that her dress is the same color as her current outfit.", "personality": "Madam Shyarly is a very kind woman, as she lent the Straw Hat Pirates a room in which they could take care of Sanji, even though said crew defeated her brother. She also gave Camie the rest of the day off so that she could spend time with her friends. She apparently does not like rudeness or vulgarity as she became very angry when Luffy asked if mermaids poop. However, her anger seems to be short-lived, as she calmed down and returned to her normal self almost instantly after Luffy apologized. Even though she is a fortune teller, Madam Shyarly regards her gift as a burden, since most of her visions are of bad things. As a consequence, she thinks that the future is better left unknown. However, even though she said that she quit fortune telling, she was still curious enough to look into Luffy's future. When she had a vision of a man in a straw hat who will be responsible for the destruction of Fish-Man Island, she went into a state of panic screaming that Luffy should be banished from Fish-Man Island, which showed how terrified she was. However, this changed when the New Fish-Man Pirates started taking over the island and Shyarly calmly told their captain, Hody Jones, that Monkey D. Luffy will be the one to destroy Fish-Man Island and not Hody himself, showing that she is willing to believe her own fortune telling over any other apparent predicaments. After the civil war ended, she destroyed her crystal ball, claiming that she will never look into the future again and that she would be very happy if her last prediction did not become true. Unlike her brother, Arlong, Shyarly is not prejudiced against all humans as she even encouraged the Fish-Man Island children to see with their own eyes instead of just listening to the opinions of others.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the proprietor of the Mermaid Cafe, she has complete control of the restaurant. Being a mermaid, she has several abilities unique to her race. It is not yet shown but she may have the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is one of basic ability found in all mermaids. Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, as a mermaid she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the Flying Fish Riders. However, like any mermaid, she is vulnerable on land. As a fortune teller, she has the ability to see the future. She uses a crystal ball as a medium to look into the future and see events that are yet to come. The one limitation to her power is that she cannot predict the exact time period when her predictions will happen, but only that they will happen. Since it was seen on a giant clam, it is unknown if it is an actual crystal ball or a giant pearl used as one. By breaking her own crystal ball, Shyarly has given up on her scrying abilities. She is very accurate in her predictions; according to the people of Fish-Man Island, her predictions have never been known to be wrong. She predicted the dawning of the Great Age of Pirates, as well as the outcome of the Summit War of Marineford and Whitebeard's death. She more recently made a prediction that a man in a straw hat, whom she presumes to be Luffy, will destroy Fish-Man Island. However, Luffy left Fish-Man Island without destroying it so that prediction has not come to pass. But since events that Shyarly foresaw can happen anytime from a day to a year later, there is still a possibility that Shyarly's prediction is not wrong yet."},

{"name": "Silvers Rayleigh", "episode": "Episode 19", "chapter": "Chapter 8", "year": 1998, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 500.", "appearance": "Rayleigh is an elderly man of relatively tall height with a very muscular build and tan skin. Two of his most distinguishing traits are his round glasses and facial hair, which is arranged embattled across his lower jaw. He also has a scar over his right eye, which he has had for many years. Rayleigh chooses to dress quite simply, usually just in a nearly plain t-shirt, shorts, and sandals. When out in public, he also seems to enjoy the cover of a large silver hooded cloak, though the hood is often down. Underneath these clothes, the old man's body is surprisingly built and very well-toned, a testament to his incredible strength. When Rayleigh was younger, he had clean cut strawberry blond hair (black when first seen in the anime) and had a moderate amount of facial hair. Over the years, as his hair whitened, he grew it out. He also grew a beard from his initial striped facial hair. During Roger's last year alive, Rayleigh was noticeably taller, reaching almost the same height as his former captain. Regardless of his age, Rayleigh is a muscular man with a broad chest and well-built body. During Rayleigh's first appearance in Buggy's flashback, he was seen wearing a t-shirt with an ornately decorated collar, a motif that appeared even in the long coat he wore during the Battle of Edd War. He wore an orange shirt, light-brown spotted bermudas, and simple sandals. He also has a silver-colored coat hanging from his shoulders. After the two-year timeskip, Rayleigh now wears a black T-shirt as well as his silver hooded cloak.", "personality": "Rayleigh is light-hearted, casual, and fun loving, much like his captain Roger was. In the past, he was shown to have been impatient with the antics of the younger crew members and took the position of crew disciplinarian very seriously. However, he has changed his personality in his older years, becoming much more relaxed even when training Luffy. Though he often has a serious air, Rayleigh enjoys going with the flow and appearing in unexpected places and in unexpected ways, especially given his status and age. He often comments on his age and how his body \"does not work the way it used to\", much like Garp. Rayleigh is not often headstrong, looking before he leaps and taking time to plan ahead before taking action, although he does not hesitate to act if needs be. Even when entering into an unfortunate or unplanned situation such as engaging a Marine admiral in combat or having his ship sink in the Sea King infested waters of the Grand Line, Rayleigh remains completely calm, pushing forward through adversity with no hesitation. However, Rayleigh has something of a fatherly side to him. This is shown when it comes to Luffy and Hancock, and when pushed, Rayleigh is capable of anger when provoked. When Blackbeard invaded Amazon Lily and tried to kill Hancock, Rayleigh stared furiously towards him, even referring him as a brat who he didn't like. He is typically open and talkative, and like Whitebeard, seems to enjoy talking about the past and its great times, as well as the good old days of their near-bygone era. In spite of this, he appeared reluctant to get into the darker topic of the Void Century. He was willing to divulge the whole truth to Nico Robin if she wished, but she declined his offer. Like Whitebeard, he is also aware of his own limitations that he's far past his prime. In spite of his legendary status, Rayleigh admitted he would be no match for Blackbeard in a straight up fight at his age and was gambling on his reputation to scare him off. As stated by Shakky, he loves alcohol and women, which he proved when he is first introduced saving Camie from being mistreated by Disco while holding a hip flask. He prefers to be called \"Ray-san\". Despite once being enemies with the Whitebeard Pirates, Rayleigh seems to have great respect for their captain, like Roger, and shed a tear for Whitebeard's passing.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\", Rayleigh is an extremely skilled and powerful combatant. Shakuyaku stated that he was \"100 times stronger\" than all of the Eleven Supernovas by the time they first arrived on the Sabaody Archipelago. In his younger days with Gol D. Roger, Rayleigh commanded the rest of Roger's crew as his first mate and held several duties, like supervising his subordinates, including the young apprentices Buggy and Shanks. When Vice Admiral Garp was informed that Rayleigh may be on the Sabaody Archipelago, he told his men not to confront him, nor should Fleet Admiral Sengoku be informed. Garp reasoned that the Marines should not confront two legends, Whitebeard and Rayleigh, at the same time and even admitted that if the Marines were to make an honest attempt at capturing Rayleigh, they would need to do serious preparation if they did not want to lose countless soldiers in the attempt, a true testament to his extraordinary strength. His reputation alone was enough to have Blackbeard, one of the Four Emperors who had spent two years mastering the Yami Yami no Mi and the Gura Gura no Mi, to retreat from Amazon Lily. Rayleigh's immense battle prowess allowed him to fight on par with Admiral Kizaru, preventing him from attacking the Straw Hat Pirates. However, he himself has admitted that he is not as young as he used to be, and as a result can tire in battle. He also stated that due to his old age, he would likely be incapable of defeating Blackbeard. This implies that when he was in the prime of his strength, he may have been even stronger than when he fought Kizaru and could pose a serious threat to Blackbeard. Eustass Kid himself even states that Rayleigh was a \"legend\". Rayleigh is also an expert in the coating business, as he performs such operations for various pirate ships heading down to Fish-Man Island, and he understands the workings of deep-sea currents. Rayleigh has an extremely crafty and cunning mentality; he has managed to evade the grasp of the expansive World Government for over 20 years and quickly learned to exploit the slave-trading business on Sabaody Archipelago for personal gain (getting himself caught and sold to a wealthy bidder, before escaping and robbing his \"master\"). Calm and level-headed at virtually any and all times, he was the individual to break up arguments and disputes aboard the Oro Jackson, as first mate and the right-hand man to Gol D. Roger himself. Rayleigh knows the \"true history\" of the world from his time with Roger. However, he has also stated that, as a pirate crew lacking the archaeological knowledge of scholars of Ohara's caliber, they could have interpreted that information differently than the Ohara scholars. However, this is questionable given the Roger Pirates had Kozuki Oden, who possessed the knowledge on how to read and write the language on the Poneglyphs. Another noticeable trait of Rayleigh is his incredible perceptive and deduction capability. This is shown when he was (within a matter of moments) easily able to deduce what had happened after ending up on the slave auction stage on the Sabaody Archipelago. Rayleigh possesses immense physical strength despite his elderly age. He was capable of killing several Sea Kings with his bare hands even after swimming to Amazon Lily from outside the Calm Belt. In the anime, he could throw bullets with extreme force and accuracy to destroy cannonballs fired at him. Rayleigh is extremely fast and possesses extraordinary reflexes. When removing Camie's exploding collar, he patiently calculated the time when the collar released itself and quickly tossed it away before it detonated. He could also intercept Kizaru's attack when the admiral was about to kill Roronoa Zoro, and also managed to keep up with his light-enhanced speed. Though tarnished by his old age, Rayleigh still possesses immense levels of endurance and stamina, being able to swim to Amazon Lily from outside the Calm Belt while killing a number of Sea Kings in his way despite swimming such a long distance. Rayleigh is an extremely skilled swordsman. He was able to fight on equal grounds with Admiral Kizaru, who himself is a highly skilled swordsman when wielding his Ama no Murakumo, and managed to cut and draw blood from the admiral's face by combining Busoshoku Haki with his swordsmanship. He can also create powerful compressed air slashes, as shown when he cut the ground to prevent Marines from chasing after Luffy. Rayleigh is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Luffy about each type of Haki and trained him in the basics. Rayleigh possesses immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki. His level of skill is enough to render a specific target or entire crowds completely unconscious, as shown when he knocked out Shalria before disabling an entire hall room of hostiles. Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki was at least twice as potent as Luffy's by the time of the Fish-Man Island Arc; Rayleigh could have knocked out all 100,000 of the New Fish-Man Pirates opposing the Straw Hats, whereas Luffy overwhelmed only half that. Most notably, he is among the small \"handful\" of users who are capable of using the advanced application of this type of Haki, able to \"infuse\" his body or objects with Haoshoku Haki to increase his attack power, signified by thin streams of black lightning emanating from his body. Rayleigh is an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, which allowed him to kick and redirect an attack from Kizaru, and hurt Luffy with a simple flick. He is able to imbue his Haki into certain parts of his body or objects to harden them, as shown during his training with Luffy. He can also use the advanced application of this type of Haki, as shown when he repelled and injured a giant elephant by emitting his Busoshoku Haki, He is also able to use a high-grade version of this technique, where he can channel his Haki into his opponent or objects, letting him destroy his opponent or objects from the inside out, he was seen using it when he destroyed Camie's collar from the inside out by channeling his Haki into it. In the anime, when Rayleigh uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a red-colored flowing aura. Rayleigh is an immensely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki. He could sense that there were five hundred creatures on Rusukaina who were stronger than Luffy before his training had begun and used it to dodge an elephant's attack with his eyes closed. When he arrived at Amazon Lily, Rayleigh was able to sense that Luffy was on the island. He also has knowledge of the advanced application of this type of Haki and how high-level users can see into the future. Rayleigh possesses a double-edged straight sword, with a cross hilt and a large round pommel, roughly half as long as his body height. When he defended Luffy from the Marines, he used a katana, which he keeps in a sheath."},

Despite his aversion to \"sweet\" emotions, Shishilian is more than willing to express gratitude, having knelt before the newly-arrived Straw Hat Pirates while proclaiming that he was forever indebted to them and later tried to accompany Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to stop Sanji's wedding alongside the other two Inuarashi Musketeers. He was also saddened by the death of his rival Pedro and paid respects at his grave marker.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Inuarashi Musketeers, Shishilian has authority over the rest of the Musketeers. Shishilian is an extremely powerful warrior even among the minks. Like his fellow minks, Shishilian can use Electro and, during the full moon, activate a Sulong transformation. Shishilian has extreme level of superhuman strength, as the force of his sword strikes can easily cut down multiple Artificial Zoan Devil Fruit users of the Beast Pirates. Even when injured, Shishilian can throw down multiple members of the Musketeers to roughen them up. In the anime, he even lifted an entire giant pineapple building and threw it down on his subordinates. Shishilian is also extremely fast and agile. In the anime, he could instantly cut down multiple Gifters, including the Gifters Grip Trio, without giving them time to retaliate. Shishilian is extremely skilled in swordsmanship. In the anime, alongside his fellow Inuarashi Musketeers, Shishilian expertly cut down numerous Gifters who were powerful enough to brutally overpower the other Musketeers with their Artificial Zoan Devil Fruit abilities, including the Gifters Grip Trio. Shishilian's sword style is highly aggressive, reflecting his fierce personality of going all out, swiftly cutting down numerous enemies in an instant. Shishilian wields a rapier, which he can channel Electro through."},
{"name": "Shiryu", "episode": "Episode 538", "chapter": "Chapter 440", "year": 2009, "note": "He was formally introduced in Chapter 542.", "appearance": "Shiryu is a tan man of notable height, at 3.4 meters comparable to his now-admiral Teach. He has a long face with a wide-bridged nose, a full-lipped mouth seen perpetually smoking a big cigar, and a wide, jutting, flat-ended chin. When imprisoned, Shiryu was allowed to keep his Head Jailer uniform rather than forced into prisoner garb. He had the typical officer's peaked cap with a dark-blue crown and black, low-set visor, plus a red cap band holding a frontal badge of the winged, crowned Impel Down insignia. Below, he wore what resembled a white aviator cap, the earflaps containing built-in hearing aids of sorts, consisting of perforated rings surrounding diaphragms. Below he donned a dark-blue, double-breasted trench coat that was below knee-length, ten-buttoned in gold, and with a buttoned collar bearing a red patch of the aforesaid insignia (but only the symbol) on each wing (all gold-trimmed). On Each upper arm was a red brassard with, again, said insignia, which was further borne as a buckle by the light-brown belt present for the coat. Additionally, Shiryu wore brown, color-matching gloves and boots, below elbow and knee length respectively, and dark-green pants tucked into the latter. Further part of his uniform, draped on his shoulders like a cape, was a white overcoat with the kanji goku (?) for \"prison\" emblazoned on the back. It had fringeless epaulettes consisting of red, gold-bordered rectangles marked by golden X's next to single gold buttons. The coat's sleeves were plain, lacking turned-out cuffs. In a flashback, Shiryu was seen having (as seems a trademark for high-ranking Impel Down staff) a pair of black, bat-like wing attachments on his upper back, which were no longer present by the time of his prison release. After the two-year timeskip, Shiryu has remained in his Jailer uniform, with but minor adjustments made to it. These are a color change for the coatwhile initially the same white as prior in the anime, it later becomes a light gray with white trim (and in the manga is full black)plus the epaulettes have gained a golden fringe. Every prior inclusion of the Impel Down symbol has been replaced with a plain Jolly Roger skull, though on the cap and belt buckle, the wings and crown remain.", "personality": "Shiryu is a bloodthirsty psychopath who seems to enjoy killing people any time he can. He used to exploit his Head Jailer privileges extensively to massacre many prisoners within the walls of Impel Down, just for sheer pleasure, justifying his acts by reasoning that none would care if he disposed of \"trash\". He further had no qualms about cutting down his ex-subordinates, starting to do so right after being released from prison and initially giving a sarcastic apology after the fact. Shiryu is fond of his blade and seems to relish testing it against others, even if they are far below his level. He is also shown taking personal care in maintaining his sword. Generally, Shiryu tends to keep a calm, cool-headed demeanor even in tense or unexpected situations, his relaxed smile rarely leaving his face. His cautious side is shown by his warning the Blackbeard Pirates not to underestimate Magellan or when lecturing them on how they should have prepared themselves more properly for the New World. By nature, Shiryu appears rather deceitful and treasonous, shown first by his offering to help Magellan fight for the prison if released, only to betray his former superior immediately and wreak havoc, killing his ex-subordinates mercilessly (although under the knowledge that his death sentence was only postponed, not retracted, giving him little choice outside of betrayal to escape it). While having since become a fairly loyal member of the Blackbeard Pirates, he originally voiced (in a joking manner) an intent to leave the crew if Blackbeard failed to obtain Whitebeard's power, showing a propensity to mistrust and doubt those who have yet to earn his respect; after Blackbeard's success however, Shiryu remarked on how joining him was a good decision. Still, Blackbeard himself made note of Shiryu's supposed shadiness after the timeskip, comparing him in that regard to Kuzan; Jesus Burgess, however, declared that while Kuzan was untrustworthy due to his former Marine background, Shiryu was not because of his cruelty. While Shiryu believes that the Seven Warlords of the Sea are just pirates, claiming \"once a pirate, always a pirate\" when the Impel Down staff referred to Blackbeard as a traitor, he was fully willing to aid the Blackbeard Pirates (especially since doing so enabled his liberation) and even become a member himself, thus seeming to lack a disdain for the nature of piracy in itself. Further, Shiryu (like most of his current comrades) is a fatalist, believing that it was fate that brought Blackbeard to him, and that fate told him to join the crew. Shiryu also does not seem to care much about personal details, especially if pertaining to relations he cut off; when asked by Fleet Admiral Sengoku about what happened to Magellan, he told him to find out for himself. Still, be they jailers or pirates, Shiryu seems to have a strict disposition toward his associates, shown, again, by his annoyance for his then-new pirate comrades not doing proper preparations for the New World. Shiryu seems to like smoking, as when he was let out of his prison cell, the first thing he wanted was a lighter for his cigar. On top of that, he is revealed to have a perverted side, with Oda stating that he would use his new Devil Fruit powers to spy on women's baths (like the power's previous user).", "abilities_and_powers": "As former Head Jailer of Impel Down, Shiryu held one of the highest ranks in the fortress. He commanded comparable respect to the Chief Warden himself until his abuse of power led to him being stripped of his post and privileges. After the timeskip, Shiryu has become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" that personally guard the Emperor, gaining great authority in the crew as captain of its second ship. Combat-wise, Shiryu is attested to be very powerful, not least by his current standing in an Emperor's crew. During his time in Impel Down, Shiryu was said to be equal in strength to the Warden himself, Magellan, and since the latter's bowel issues restricted his active time in the prison, Shiryu was deemed to be more dangerous. According to Ivankov, Impel Down was impregnable under the joint protection of Shiryu and Magellan, and had Shiryu been still on duty rather than imprisoned, Luffy and Bentham would not have been able to break as far down into the prison as they had. Magellan was even willing to entrust Shiryu on his own with handling the adversarial presence of Blackbeard (at the time a Warlord of the Sea) and his crew in the prison. Prior, the Chief Warden had deemed Shiryu himself such a menace as to place him in Level 6 where only the most powerful, dangerous criminals are held. All of this being more impressive by the fact that Shiryu had not yet acquired a Devil Fruit ability. Shiryu is shown to have formidable speed, seen with him cutting down several Impel Down jailers in a split second. In terms of endurance, alongside the rest of the Blackbeard crew, he was able to take a quake shockwave from Whitebeard (albeit an indirect hit) and later a direct hit from Sengoku's shockwave in his Daibutsu form, being sent back a great distance and then getting up with little trouble. Shiryu has shown great stealth capabilities even before acquiring Devil Fruit powers. When planning to defect to the Blackbeard Pirates, Shiryu could infiltrate Impel Down's monitor room completely undetected, sneak past the extremely high security to destroy all communication devices present, and even sneak up on a security guard reporting to Magellan and kill him without being noticed. After gaining his invisibility powers, Shiryu's stealth prowess increased, enabling him to perform sneak attacks on notably powerful figures, like Gecko Moria (who did not realize what happened until Shiryu revealed himself) and Monkey D. Garp (who, still, was able to sense Shiryu's approach). Shiryu is extremely proficient in wielding his sword, having used it to kill many Impel Down prisoners on mere whims. When his sword was returned to him after his long-term imprisonment, Shiryu immediately killed several of his ex-subordinates in a split second, demonstrating great precision and dexterity in his swordsmanship. Shiryu has the powers of the Suke Suke no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit that grants him the power to turn himself invisible, he can also turn whatever he is holding invisible. He uses this power to sneak up on his opponents without being spotted, allowing him to attack them by surprise. He acquired the ability soon after his crew murdered its previous user, Absalom. He personally holds the power in high regard in terms of usefulness. Shiryu is a skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, capable of imbuing his sword with it. Shiryu's weapon of choice is a nodachi called Raiu, qualified as a Meito. It had been confiscated from him due to his imprisonment in Level 6 but was returned to him when he was released to deal with Blackbeard."},
{"name": "Shirahoshi", "episode": "Episode 612", "chapter": "Chapter 531", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "Shirahoshi is a giant-sized mermaid, approximately the size of her pet Megalo but shorter than her father, and is described as \"cute but huge\" in her introduction; this makes her roughly eight to ten times the size of Luffy, an average human, excluding the length of her tail; she can hold and hide Luffy in one hand alone. According to Caribou's estimation, he put her about seven to eight times the size of a human-sized mermaid. Even as a baby, she was much larger than her mother and brothers, but still small enough to be held in her equally large father's hands. She has very long, flowing pink hair with a taiyaki-shaped hairgrip. Her breasts are large, even relative to her giant-like size, and much of her upper body is exposed. Her broadly striped tail ends in a ruffle around her waist. She tends to have blush marks on her cheeks due to her shyness. Shirahoshi has been noted for her beauty, which has been said to rival that of Boa Hancock, and Garp stated that her appearance alone was beyond everyone's expectations. She wears a cleavage-baring yellow halter top covered in pearls with a strap that widens and sticks out on the back of her neck. She also wears clam earrings and belly chains with a cloth hanging down in front. She has a very long light red and pink striped tail. When she and her family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, she wore a light-blue colored shirt. As a four-year-old, she wore a polka dot crop top with straps that floated behind her head and her tail alone was larger than her mother. As a six-year-old, she wore a light-colored crop top with floating straps.", "personality": "Despite her size, Shirahoshihas a very fragile personality. She iseasily frightened, andquickly breaksout into crying fits whenever she gets upset, such as the time when Megalo disappeared, when Luffy startled her during their first meeting, and when Luffy says that he does not like her. She is greatly pampered by her family, as she claimed that nobody ever yelled at her before and cried at the fact that Luffy was the first to do so. Whenever someone yells at her, she will interpret this as anger towards her and will start crying, while saying that the offender is scary. In fact, Shirahoshi easily tears up whenever she expresses her emotions such as joy, fear, or sadness. She can be grateful since she willingly hides Luffy from the guards after he saved her from being struck by an axe thrown by Vander Decken IX and also thanks him for rescuing Megalo. She is very considerate of her family and kingdom, saying that leaving Hard-Shell Tower even if she wants to would be a selfish thing for her to do. She is also very polite and addresses everyone with \"-sama\". She even politely rejected Decken's proposal by saying that \"he wasn't her type\". Because of her ten years of solitude, she has very limited knowledge of the world outside her tower, so she is rather curious about it as she asks Luffy about the sun, the animals, and forests, even asking him how he can eat so much despite being so small. She also does not seem to know about Devil Fruits as she called the powers of Vander Decken IX as a curse (although Decken himself also refers to his power as such). Much like the citizens of Kuja, she takes Luffy to be the norm for human males. Also, due to being locked up she has a very low stimulation level, and often becomes overly stimulated due to the events during her time with Luffy, causing her to become emotionally worked up. Because of her inexperience with proper communication, Shirahoshi accidentally offended some royals who were trying to get her attention. She seems to be naive, believing a balloon dummy to be her father and only realizing that it wasn't when she looked at it closer right before being captured (although it was part of their plan to be captured intentionally). Even though she knew Hody was behind her mother's death when Megalo confided her, she did not tell anyone because she wants to honor her mother's last wish of not holding any hatred against the killer, but this ends up being a big mistake since this allows Hody to execute his plans, despite Jinbe arguing otherwise. However, regardless of her fragile personality, she is sweet and innocent like a child which is evident when she promised to return to the castle by dinner time after leaving her tower. Shirahoshi is extremely kind as she does not bear any anger or resentment even towards people who have hurt her and her family, as despite Hody killing Otohime and later brutalizing her father and brothers right in front of her, Shirahoshi only tearfully wept. Even though not telling everyone about Hody was a dangerous mistake, this shows that Shirahoshi has a strong and gentle spirit since not hating her mother's killer even though it's her mother's last wish would be impossible for most people as noted by Jinbe, who is deeply impressed by her resolve and kindness. When Decken nearly destroys Fish-Man Island with Noah, Shirahoshi shows her bravery for the first time, putting the lives of her people ahead of her own. Even as a World Noble tried to enslave her, Shirahoshi still begged her father not to hate when he prepared to attack the noble. When the Straw Hats left Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi shows a determination to change, promising Luffy that she will stop being a crybaby.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Mermaid Princess and King Neptune's daughter, Shirahoshi has some level of authority over the kingdom her family rules, however it is unknown how much level of influence she has overall. It was stated by the Minister of the Right that her sudden disappearance from the Ryugu Palace could potentially trigger a nation-wide crisis. Being a giant-sized mermaid, Shirahoshi is able to easily lift a normal-sized person with one hand, as she had done with Luffy and Nami. Like all mermaids, she is one of the fastest swimmers in the ocean. Despite her naivete of many things, Shirahoshi has some intelligence. When swimming away from Fishman Island so that Noah would not crush it while chasing her, she realized that since the Straw Hats were the last ones to exit Ryugu Palace, the gateway between it and the island was still open, allowing her to escape the island's bubble through it. Shirahoshi has inherited from her ancestor the original Poseidon power with which to command the Sea Kings. While Merfolk and Fish-Men can summon and communicate with normal fish and marine life via sonar waves, Shirahoshi alone has the uncanny ability to call upon the titanic megafauna of the One Piece world via the same method. By screaming, she emits sonar waves that summons sea kings to her. While she was unaware of her power during her childhood, Otohime thought that if she receives a huge shock, she might subconsciously send sea kings on a rampage. However, it is later shown that sea kings are intelligent creatures so this is speculative. Otohime also described this as the most fearsome ability in the world, and that it can change the whole world in great ways. However, in the wrong hands, Shirahoshi's powers can sink the entire world into the ocean. While Luffy was destroying Noah to keep it from crashing into Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi fully awakened the ability, as sheunknowingly summoned the Sea Kings to help save both the ship and the island. Also, whencompared to the time she summoned them as a child, Shirahoshi was able to communicate with the Sea Kings perfectly,having briefly spoken to them during the escapade. The Sea Kings then stated that they were called by Shirahoshi's strong desire to help Luffy. It appears that Shirahoshi can summon them through her will and feelings even though she was not directly calling for them. This ability is what classifies her as one of the Ancient Weapons that the World Government fears so much; she is the current incarnation of the weapon Poseidon. Like her mother before her, Shirahoshi possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki, though she has yet to demonstrate any use of it."},

He also wears a belt that has the kanji for forest engraved upon it. Due to not having cut his hair in twenty five years, his hair is so long that its entire length is almost as long as Shoujou's entire body height.

Still, he befriends the Straw Hats with the same ease. Despite his friendly attitude, he does think highly of his power and abilities. He confidently states that he is the logical replacement for Crocodile as a Warlord of the Sea, despite clearly being nowhere near Crocodile's level of power. He has the habit of telling trivia about his own life to others, asking them if they are impressed about it, but is usually ignored. Like his brother, he is protective of Cricket, who they have come to know as a father figure. He and his fellow Alliance members displayed an amazing spirit to get back up and continue their modifications to the Going Merry after Bellamy's attacks.

When he was older, he wore his hair in a pony tail, and he no longer wore his cap. He also had yellow bands around his upper arms.", "personality": "Seto was a Shandia who desired to be like Kalgara, whom he admired. When he caught the plague, he became distraught that he was going to die, never seeing his dream come true. He became one of the first Shandia to trust Noland, who as a stranger cured his disease and earned his trust. He displayed noble traits by standing in front of the cages that held Noland's men when the villagers wanted to kill them, keeping their promise not to harm Noland's men until the time ran out. However, he was quick to shun Noland like any other Shandia once they discovered their sacred forest was cut down. When Mousse explained the misunderstanding, he lived hoping for the day Noland would return. Like Kalgara, he displayed a strong desire to protect his village and cared heavily for its people.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a Shandia and training since he was child to be a warrior like Kalgara, Seto was presumably strong.

{"name": "Sengoku", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Sengoku is a tall, fair-skinned, and muscular man with a long, braided goatee and a mustache. He is usually seen alongside his pet goat. His cap covers his hair, which is set in a large afro. His afro was revealed after using his Devil Fruit powers and having his cap knocked off. Ironically, prior to the timeskip, despite already being an elderly man upon his debut (being 77 years old at the time, thereby making him a year older than Garp and Rayleigh, both men being from his generation), Sengoku displayed little to no physical signs of his actual age, with his hair still not having grayed after 20 years. He typically wears black-rimmed glasses and a white and gold full Marine admiral uniform that is adorned with medals. The most distinctive features of this uniform are a life-size seagull on top of his cap, and his oversized Marine coat which he wears like a cape. His coat has the kanji for justice, in blue, emblazoned on the back, and has unique colored cuffs, with his being white. Twenty years before the present storyline, when Sengoku was already an admiral, he did not cover his afro and sported only a mustache. During his orders to Saul to bombard Ohara, he wore less regal-looking attire than he does in the present storyline: a simple black tank top, blue jeans, and his glasses, which is unlike a typical admiral's formal suit. The only Marine-related attire he wore at the time was apparently his Marine coat, draped over like a cape. However, when he was fighting Shiki in Marineford, he was wearing a black double-breasted suit with a blue tie under his coat. Fourteen years ago, still as an Admiral, he is seen wearing a white suit with a floral button dress shirt underneath and begins to grow his trademark braided goatee, albeit much shorter than it is now. His epaulettes during his time as an Admiral were similar to Garp's, which were red and black, but he doesn't have black on it, and he never used red epaulets ever since he became Fleet Admiral. In his youth, he also did not cover his afro and he lacked a beard. As a child, Sengoku had his trademark afro, and he was seen wearing a karate uniform with a black belt tied on his waist. During the two-year timeskip, Sengoku aged with his hair turning gray, and has also grown sideburns. His former uniform is now replaced with a more casual wear during his retirement. He is wearing a dark blue shirt with red and green zig-zag patterns, orange tie with white marine shorts, and a Marine coat.", "personality": "Sengoku appears to be an exceedingly proud, enlightened, and intelligent man who was loyal to the World Government and, up until the cover-up of the Impel Down incident, never questioned orders from them. He also will not accept any reason for letting a criminal go, and also has a habit of getting very irritated with failure. His motto is \"Reigning Justice\" (, Kunrinsuru Seigi?), in that he prioritizes upholding justice over all things, although he certainly does not shy away from actions that fall under the code of Absolute Justice. From his view, the Seven Warlords of the Sea are just pirates, though he notes how valuable they can be when the time comes. However, as the years went by, he appeared to be losing his faith in the government, shown after the Summit War of Marineford when he was furious at the order from the Five Elders to suppress the second escape incident in Level 6 of Impel Down to save face and keep the faith of the people, thus placing nations in danger. This eventually led Sengoku to resign from the Marines. Before the Summit War, he was concerned over the movements of the Straw Hat Pirates, and had followed their actions ever since they departed from Water 7, though at the time his current concern was about the upcoming war against Whitebeard, to the point that he brushed off the incident of the attack on a Celestial Dragon and left it to the admirals. Upon hearing about Luffy's break-in of Impel Down, Sengoku was so frustrated that he almost took it out on Garp, and had come close to losing his patience with the antics of the Monkey family in general. Sengoku also believed that a person's birth (with the consideration of the parents' reputation) is enough to determine the potential impact they could bring to the world if left unchecked, such as Ace being Roger's son and Luffy being Dragon's son. This is shown at Ace's execution, where one of the main reasons for Ace's execution was not just because he was a pirate, but because he was the son of Gol D. Roger, and Sengoku believed that Ace must be eliminated by any means necessary, even if that meant an all-out war with Whitebeard. His epithet, Sengoku the Buddha, may seem contradictory at best since throughout the course of the series, while he has shown himself to be an extremely calm, composed, collected man, he has also shown himself to be quite capable of anger and violence. Doflamingo remarked on this irony when the Seven Warlords of the Sea convened at Mary Geoise to choose a successor for Crocodile. However, with the revelation of his Devil Fruit power, it would seem his epithet's origins come from his fruit's ability, exactly like the three current admirals (although his is not an alias). He also appears to have some common sense, as shown when he ordered the Summit War to be put to an end and ordered the other Marines to tend to the wounded, in doing so he avoided further casualties and a potential conflict with the Red Hair Pirates. His justice is not as uncompromising as Akainu's, and it seems to be more of a mix of both absolute and moral justice, as he did hold a large speech about morality. Another hint of moral justice is also shown when he got infuriated when the World Government decided to cover up the mass escape of the Level 6 Impel Down prisoners released by Blackbeard, although he once said not to question the World Government's orders. In addition, in his conversation with Kong, he stated that justice is a matter of personal values and does not endorse one form of justice over the other, mirroring Smoker's talk with Tashigi in Arabasta. This insinuates that Sengoku is more of a pragmatist in applying justice. Caesar Clown also states Sengoku is too soft for rejecting the potential of mass-murder weapons and experimentation on prisoners, in contrast to what Caesar believes Sakazuki would want, further enforcing that Sengoku is more moral than he appears. After becoming an Inspector General, Sengoku seems to have become far more cheerful and laid-back and tends to take things very casually like his friend Garp, such as how he merely laughed playfully when Issho voiced his thoughts in how Law and Luffy should be acknowledged as Dressrosa's heroes, along with the admiral's decision to not arrest the pirate alliance immediately. Tsuru notes this drastic change in Sengoku's behavior is the result of how he has less responsibilities as compared to his time in the past. Regardless, he still shows wisdom as he passed down his knowledge to the current generation of Marines about the past regarding the Four Emperors and pointed out how many world known figures have some affiliation with Wano. Though he may appear to be stern because of his duties as a Marine, he is actually very kind and compassionate. His drastic actions at the Summit War of Marineford were motivated by the desire to protect innocent civilians from getting embroiled in conflict out of fear that when the secrets held in One Piece are discovered, it would turn the world on its head and lead to total war. He also expressed extreme rage towards the World Government for trying to cover up the breakout of extremely dangerous criminals imprisoned in Level Six of Impel Down, as letting such criminals loose could pose immense danger to civilians. Furthermore, learning about Donquixote Rosinante's death, a man he considered like his own son, was enough to break his heart and drive him to tears. After the death of T Bone, Sengoku retained his serious demeanor when necessary, in spite of his laziness. He showed concerned for the civilians and how they attacked the Marines due to the influences of Cross Guild. Like his longtime colleague Garp, Sengoku's favorite snack is okaki, fried rice crackers. He is often seen munching on them, especially in his retirement. Like Issho, Sengoku's second favorite snack is a Soba Noodles.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former Fleet Admiral of the entire Marine force, Sengoku had absolute power over every action the Marines do, including summoning a Buster Call, granting and removing a Warlord's title at any time, provided they meet the criteria for either. The only ones that are above him are Imu (in secret), the Five Elders, and Commander-in-Chief Kong. However, with his resignation, came the loss of such authorities. Alongside Garp, Sengoku is one of the most powerful Marines of his generation. Both Gol D. Roger and Whitebeard held high regard for him. After defeating a group of Marines, Roger commented that he was one of the two Marines that were worth his time, the other being Garp. When Shiki was wreaking havoc in Marineford twenty-two years ago, Sengoku fought alongside Garp and were able to subdue him whilst destroying half the city in the process, keeping him imprisoned in Impel Down, a tremendous feat as Shiki is an immensely powerful swordsman who had single-handedly slaughtered an entire army of Marines before they subjugated him. Even at 79 years old, Sengoku could, alongside Fujitora and Tsuru,defeat Jack, one of the top-ranking, strongest members of the Beasts Pirates under the Emperor Kaidou. An extraordinary master strategist with immense military experience, Sengoku is renowned for his tactical and strategic genius by Marines and pirates alike. He is mainly responsible for all the Marine maneuvers deployed throughout the Whitebeard War at Marineford, such as forwarding a plan to all Marines that Portgas D. Ace was to be executed ahead of the official schedule with the intention that the opposing pirate forces would intercept the message and lose their composure. He then conspired with Admiral Akainu in a plot to derail the alliance between Whitebeard's core divisions and the 41 independent New World pirate crews assisting by directing a 20-strong Pacifista division to target only the non-Whitebeard division pirates, and it was possible that the earlier transmissions regarding Ace's true parentage was not only an act of public justification but also to demoralize those pirates who were undermined by the Roger Pirates. With Akainu's persuasion, Sengoku's plan managed to drive one of those captains to attempt assassinating Whitebeard himself, and while the blow was not fatal, it did further debilitate Whitebeard's already hazardous condition. He operated his strategies while keeping close in mind the various powers of his greatest subordinates, especially the Marine Admirals: raising Marineford's siege walls in conjunction with Akainu's \"Ryusei Kazan\" to rout the allied pirate forces and destroying Whitebeard's flagship, the Moby Dick while protecting the brunt of the Marine garrison from the damage. Even without his Zoan Devil Fruit powers, Sengoku has enormous strength, enough to effortlessly hold down an enraged Garp with only one hand. Sengoku is also a tremendously skilled hand-to-hand fighter. Combined with his Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit powers, he could knock away all the members of the Blackbeard Pirates, who are extremely powerful in their own right, sending them flying. Sengoku has extraordinary speed, even in his gigantic buddha form. He could launch an unexpected surprise attack on all the members of the Blackbeard Pirates. Sengoku ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a giant golden Buddha and a human-Buddha hybrid at will. This power is the source of his nickname, \"Sengoku the Buddha\". A number of Marines claimed that they have never seen him use this power before the war. As a Zoan, Sengoku gains an immense boost to his already impressive physical abilities while in his Buddha form. With only a single indirectly connecting punch, Sengoku was able to make the Marineford execution platform collapse, despite the punch being cushioned and blocked by Luffy's Gear 3 inflated belly and Mr. 3's \"stronger than steel\" Candle Wall. He can also release an exceptionally powerful golden shockwave with a palm thrust, it is strong enough to send a majority of the incredibly strong Blackbeard Pirates, consisting of some of the most dangerous criminals in history, flying a fair distance away. In the anime, his golden shockwaves are strong enough to clash evenly with the tremor shockwaves created by the Gura Gura no Mi of Blackbeard. It has been stated that all marines with the rank of vice admiral and above possess Haki, so as a former Fleet Admiral and leader of the Marines, Sengoku is fully capable of using Haki. He is one of the very few people in the world who can use Haoshoku, Busoshoku, and Kenbunshoku Haki. While he has not yet showcased Busoshoku Haki in the manga, he has utilized it in the game One Piece: Burning Blood."},
{"name": "Senor Pink", "episode": "Episode 702", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Senor Pink is a tall, obese man with brown eyes, large lips, dark shaggy hair, and a double chin. He wears a pink bonnet and purple aviator sunglasses, and carries a yellow pacifier in his mouth. He also wears a blue scarf with white polka dots around his neck with a pink bib underneath it. He wears a purple cut off, sleeveless shirt with the logo \"Let's Baby\" in yellow on it, and what appears to be small swim trunks with stars all over it that are folded over to resemble a diaper. The baby outfit is a homage to his late infant son. When he was 30 years old, Senor Pink was much slimmer than his present self. He wore a dark-colored suit with a floral shirt, and his hair was neatly combed, showcasing the signs of a well-dressed gentleman. Shortly after the death of Rosinante, Pink adopted his current appearance of dressing as an infant due to it making his comatose wife smile. By age 36, he gained extra weight after falling into depression (having started the formation of his portly figure), his shirt was light-colored and the logo \"Let's Baby\" was dark-colored. In the present, it is the other way around with \"Don't Cry\" printed on the back. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Senor Pink is shown wearing a dark-colored shirt with dirty pants, and he sported numerous bruises on his face.", "personality": "He is surrounded by many women who seem to be extremely fond of him. However, he claims to be too old for them; advising them to find someone younger, despite dressing himself as an infant. He is also shown to have some manner of indecency as he had no qualms about ripping a woman's bra off in order to wipe his mouth, which does not seem to deter the women's admiration of him, and using a shoe brush to brush his teeth. The women who admire him, as well as others, often remark he is \"hard-boiled\", while his male underlings equally praise how cool he tends to act. He seems to care about his comrades, as he took a direct hit from Franky's Rocket Launcher on purpose so that Machvise would not take damage, as he was vulnerable after having tried to crush Franky. He seems to have both a cruel and a compassionate side, calling Sugar useless one moment but then worrying about her safety the next. He is also a very proud man, as he refuses to use his ability to run away from his enemies. He even promised that if Franky could survive his strongest attack, he would admit defeat, a promise well kept. That compassionate side seems to show again, as Franky was able to trick Pink into abandoning the fight when Franky lied that he heard a woman in trouble nearby. Although Pink was angry at being tricked, he was relieved there was not actually a woman in trouble. He continues to show this side of himself such as how he protects a random cat during the middle of battle, something which made even Franky cry in admiration. His love for his wife was so strong, that he would hide his pirate career from her, as she hates pirates. However, his steadfast loyalty to his crew made it impossible for him to leave them either, forcing him to juggle between his two families. When she found out and left him, he became heartbroken, and did everything to regain her smile, even if it means dressing up like their deceased son by wearing infant clothing. Even when everyone else laughed at him for it, calling him a pervert and believing that he became so because of his loss of his wife and son, he easily brushed it all off due to the love for his wife. Overall, Senor Pink can be considered one of the kinder members of the Donquixote Family. Despite dressing like a baby and sucking on a pacifier, and his love for his late son, he claims to not like children.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Senor Pink held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the Corrida Colosseum's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high. It is said that when Senor Pink and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory. Pink is quite perceptive, as he saw through Franky's body design, and realized that the cyborg's back remains unmodified, and therefore, a glaring weakness. He possesses great superhuman strength, as he was able to wrestle and knockdown Franky, a very large and heavy cyborg. He is extremely durable and has vast amounts of stamina, as he survived a direct hit from Franky's rocket with only minor injuries and burns,and retained consciousness after being struck by Franky's Strong Hammer thirty times. He has great skill in wrestling and hand-to-hand combat, and can use it in combination with his Devil Fruit powers to perform devastating attacks that caused extreme damage to Franky despite his cybernetically enhanced body with a strong level of resistance to even firearms and artillery. Senor Pink ate the Sui Sui no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to swim through solid ground and through walls. This grants him the ability to move underground and through structures to attack at unsuspecting angles and avoid attacks. This power also allows him to infiltrate enemy bases and commit assassinations. When entering Minion Island to intercept Donquixote Rosinante, a 32-years old Pink carried a rifle. During the takeover of Dressrosa, a 36-years old Pink carried a katana on his back."},
{"name": "Sentomaru", "episode": "Episode 497", "chapter": "Chapter 401", "year": 2008, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 511.", "appearance": "Sentomaru is a large man with light skin and a stocky build similar to that of a sumo wrestler. He has a large scar extending from his left eye to the left corner of his mouth caused by wild bears. His outfit consists of a shirt that resembles a giant brown bib or apron with an emblem meaning \"heaven\" on the front, and a large red and white rope or \"tsuna\" (traditionally worn by yokozunas). Sentomaru also has bandages wrapped around his right fist and elbows, along with the kanji  (sen?, \"battle\") tattooed on his left shoulder. Sentomaru carries around a huge, two-edged axe, as tall as himself, and just as large. Following the timeskip, he is shown wearing a Marine coat over his shoulders due to his acceptance into the Marines. He has also removed the bandages around his arms. On his coat, the middle design's outline changed from a light green to white and the white tomoe around that became thicker.", "personality": "Since he asserts to having the tightest defense, Sentomaru also claims to have the tightest mouth and refuses to reply to any questions. However, despite his claim, he is willing to tell everyone about himself whenever something related to a question, or an event occurs. Whenever he gives away information, he claims he is giving it away freely and not because the person he is talking to asked or was curious about something. Sentomaru is confident in his abilities. He took it upon himself to deal with the Straw Hat Pirates with only PX-1 to accompany him. He remains unfazed even in the most serious events, as he was surprised to see Chopper in his monster form while keeping his composure. He was visibly shocked when Luffy easily defeated a Pacifista two years later. He appears to be perceptive as well, having quickly observed that Luffy enforced the impact of a Jet Pistol with Busoshoku Haki after striking down a Pacifista. He is very loyal to the Marines and although he does not have anything against pirates, he still takes his duty to apprehend them seriously. After the two-year timeskip where Sentomaru was officially inducted into the Marine ranks, he takes the position bestowed upon him very seriously, having opted to partake in the attempted arrest of the Straw Hat Pirates after they were reported to have once again appeared in the Sabaody Archipelago, with two Pacifista units to back him up. However, his personal debt with Vegapunk led him to defend him against the World Government, specifically CP0. Sentomaru seems to have a sense of respect for worthy opponents, as when confronting and questioning the fake Luffy, who boasted that he was the real felon, Sentomaru notes that Luffy was not a piece of filth like he was. He seems to show disinterest when someone does not meet his expectations, as he pointed out that Devil Dias could not possibly have survived in the New World after he attempted to escape from the World Nobles. He even called the pirates who joined the Fake Straw Hat Crew \"idiots\" because he felt that they were dumb enough to be fooled in the first place.", "abilities_and_powers": "Sentomaru claims to be a world-class guard and the fact that he is in charge of the Marine's Science Unit suggests that he has great insight in that field of expertise. Sentomaru is one of the few people that has direct control over the Pacifista, not requiring an command chip to give them orders. His authority is only superseded by that of the Five Elders and Dr. Vegapunk plus his satellites. His fighting style is similar that of Bartholomew Kuma's, standing like a sumo wrestler and striking with open-palm thrusts which are enhanced through the use of Haki. This allows him to injure even Devil Fruit users as easily as normal people. He is faster than his size and build would suggest, being able to outpace Luffy's normal running speed. In addition, he appeared unfazed by Usopp's giant smokescreen shortly beforehand. As a child, Sentomaru was capable of defeating a group of wild bears that were a major threat to his village. He also seems to possess a great deal of endurance, as he was able to remain conscious for some time after being stabbed by an awakened Lucci in order to prevent the Seraphim from falling under the command of CP0. Sentomaru carries a massive executioner axe, but only uses it against tougher opponents such as Chopper in his monster form and Kizaru. He used the broad side to flatten Demaro Black, smashing him into the ground with enough force to bury him halfway. Sentomaru can use Busoshoku Haki to enhance his attacks. His control is such that he can not only strike Devil Fruit users and cause them harm by bypassing their defenses but do so without actually making physical contact. He claims to have the \"world's greatest defense\", shown when Luffy could not land even a single punch on him. Sentomaru can use Busoshoku Haki at an advanced level that allows him to emit his armament a short distance without a medium. After the timeskip, however, it was shown that his Haki defense could be broken through by someone such as Lucci, who in his Awakened Form, was able to pierce through him using a Haki-imbued Shugan. Sentomaru possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He clarified to X Drake that he is not threatening him but that he is simply warning him. However, when he notices that a battle is about to start and cannot be avoided anymore, he will attack. When duty calls and his services are needed, Scotch seems to have a ruthless streak of sorts, evidenced when he crushed Gaburu's rebellion in cold blood to teach the revolutionaries a lesson, and even has no qualms against attacking an old woman.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Emperor Kaidou entrusted him as a guardian of one of his favorite islands, Scotch is undoubtedly a powerful fighter. Indeed, he single-handedly overwhelmed Gaburu's rebellion, while surviving an encounter with Super Rookie X Drake invading the island.

These arms make it possible for him to utilize his Devil Fruit powers without the need to contort the said limbs, whenever he converts them into makeshift instruments. Apoo also has a rather broad chest cavity, which may aid him in producing deep and bellowing drum-like sounds. Apoo's lower jaw is also somewhat wider than the upper half of his face, similar to Itomimizu of the Foxy Pirates. Besides these, his most distinguishing attributes are his unique physical characteristics and the objects adorned on him, all of which are music themed or related.

His fighting stance is also music themed as he appears like he's moving his hands in the same way a DJ would move theirs when mixing music on turntables. He wears a set of orange headphones with his name on either side over his ears and hairstyle similar to Jabra's, where the hair on his scalp has been pulled tightly so that his roots resemble lightning patterns. Before the time skip, the portion of hair at the center of his forehead was, while spiky, flattened into a square shape. After the timeskip, the center portion of his hair resembled a triangle shape while the side strips were more straightened as opposed to appearing like lightning bolts. During the Fire Festival, the side strips of hair as well as the center portion all resembled lightning bolts. Apoo wears a red gown with the symbol  (oto?, \"sound\" or \"music\") at the center of a large flower-like print splayed across the chest area, as well as on his back. His clothes are possibly inspired by the Qizhuan or Manfu style of chinese garb. Apoo also has a yellow scarf around his waist. He also has what seems to be the design of a green rose sewed on front of his left shoulder. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Apoo is shown with significantly shorter hair and a rounder face. His hair was also combed into a pompadour in the front, with his braid in the back. His attire was a less elaborate shirt and bow tie. His teeth also lacked the dark markings that make them resemble piano keys. After the timeskip, he wears a set of black headphones, and changed to a different garb that has the kanji moved to the right side of his pants. He also updated his gown with ornamental ropes, or huaniu, across the chest, and epaulets on the shoulders, evoking imagery of some high ranking marine uniforms.", "personality": "Apoo is an eccentric, boisterous pirate with an affinity for music and parties. A disc jockey by nature, Apoo employs dancing and music playing in many of his mannerisms, acting like a stereotypical radio personality. One reason he appears to enjoy being part of the Beasts Pirates is because of the \"Golden Kagura\" celebration they hold annually during every Fire Festival, making sure that he would not miss the latest. He also happens to be an enthusiastic photographer and journalist, being excited at the prospect of a news story he could potentially profit massively from. Apoo seems to be a passive individual who would not seek to harm others without a good reason. As a result, he is normally defensive during confrontations, postponing a brawl with Eustass Kid at a Sabaody Archipelago bar because they were about to finally head into the New World. Despite this, Apoo can be very curious at times, meaning he cannot deny himself an audience to an interesting battle should the opportunity present itself. When facing an opponent that is too strong for him, Apoo prefers to run away, although he enjoys provoking and taunting his enemies before leaving. Apoo is highly opportunistic, preferring to strike from a safe distance and through the element of surprise. Deceitful and treacherous, Apoo is smarter than he lets on. Despite having a bad relationship with Eustass Kid, Apoo was still able to feign cooperation and convincingly play the part of ally to him, only to later set his supposed allies against one of the Four Emperors, for whom Apoo worked all along. Apoo has a low opinion of Pirate Alliances in general, believing that they only lead to eventual betrayal. Shown to be very cunning and backstabbing, Apoo is willing to change sides on a whim with no loyalty to anyone other than himself, letting his targets fight against each other and take themselves out so he can step in at the end and finish off the last man standing. In spite of his usually outgoing and reckless character, Apoo can be rather cautious and distrustful of other people. At the end of the Summit War of Marineford, Apoo could not fathom why a pirate like Trafalgar Law would put themselves in potential danger to rescue someone, having been aware of the nasty rumors surrounding the \"Surgeon of Death\". This mindset has not changed much post-timeskip, especially when he finds himself in territory he perceives as hostile. Apoo wreaked havoc on Kid's hideout under the suspicion that a sniper could have been targeting him. He is also perceptive enough to sense killing intent emanating from others. Apoo is a gutsy pirate who knows the importance of a fight. He never starts a fight only for him to flinch later. When he took photos of CP0's agents willing to sell them to Morgans, which resulted in one of the agents attacking him, he proudly got up from the attack and continued what he started. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own laughter style: \"Apapapa\" ()", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Worst Generation, Apoo is a fearsome pirate who, with his crew, was able to survive the Grand Line's first half and ultimately enter the New World. Over the timeskip, his bounty rose from 198,000,000 (the sixth highest among the Eleven Supernovas of his generation) to 350,000,000, indicating his great strength. Despite his eccentric looks and demeanor, Apoo has proven himself quite competent and no-nonsense in battle, especially with his peculiar yet dangerous Devil Fruit ability. Using it pre-timeskip on the Sabaody Archipelago, he was able to land two effective surprise attacks on (though failed to actually harm) Marine Admiral Kizaru when none of the other Supernovas involved in the battle could even touch him. Post-timeskip on Onigashima, Apoo was able to injure both Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro in succession, leaving the former briefly unconscious from a single attack, by capitalizing on their lack of understanding (and knowing how to guard against) his powers. In general, Apoo has been seen effectively holding his own against his fellow members of the Worst Generation, such as X Drake, even with them knowing how to evade his powers. As the former informant of the Beasts Pirates, Apoo held a certain degree of authority in the organization; in particular, he seems to have the ability to command the Numbers, who are known to be extremely difficult to bring under control by other members of the Beasts Pirates. Though he is shown to have a strong preference for fighting at a medium-to-long distance using his \"Fighting Music\", Apoo has some competence in close-quarters combat, specifically while wielding his pair of tonfas, and is strong enough to parry attacks from two physically mighty foes at once. He could even trade blows with X Drake while the latter was in his human-allosaurus hybrid form. Otherwise, Apoo has displayed impressive agility and acrobatic jumping skills as well as notable durability. He retained consciousness (though was heavily injured) after being kicked down into a multistoried concrete building with enough force to make it collapse and recovered quickly from getting crushed by a palm strike from Kid's giant arm of scrap metal (and, while somewhat injured by the latter, swiftly responded with an attack of his own). Apoo also took a powerful surprise attack from an Ittoryu-using Zoro, which seemed to cut rather deep into his chest, and remained not only conscious but still able to fight. Apoo demonstrates high intelligence as he can use his wits to come out advantageous in any situation. While outwardly proposing an alliance with the Kid Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates, it was actually a ruse to set up the other two in order to absorb them into the Beast Pirates with whom he had pledged his services to already. In Wano, he was able to survive attacks from members of the other Worst Generation and several other heavy-hitters while not engaging in any large-scale skirmishes himself. When encountering X Drake, a fellow member of the Worst Generation, Apoo proposed to Drake to form an alliance to eliminate whichever side that won the raid afterwards, but he was rejected. He tried the same tactic on Kaidou's son, Yamato, which failed due to the fact that Yamato had joined the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance. Apoo has shown extensive musical prowess to go along with his Devil Fruit ability, allowing him to play the various wildly different instruments he can transform into (see below) with casual ease. True to his name, he is also a skilled DJ. Apoo ate the Oto Oto no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to morph parts of his body into various musical instruments that he can playe.g., his jaw into a cymbal or bulb horn, his chest into a drum, his teeth into piano keys, or his arm into a saxophoneand he refers to this as his \"Tatakau Music\". By playing specific notes and tunes using specific instruments, Apoo releases sound waves that, apart from seeming to have a hypnotic effect, can instantly deliver various forms of physical damage (e.g., slashing, impact, or explosive) to anyone who hears them, depending on what instrument he plays. Additionally, Apoo can limit his music's effects to specific targets of his choosing, specifically those he is looking at. As noted by Killer, Apoo's attacks carry anywhere in hearing range and, as long as his music is heard by his chosen target, its effects are nigh-instant and unavoidable; since the only \"traveling\" part of Apoo's attacks is the sound itself, they are hard to predict, with the speed of effect enough that extremely fast adversaries are unable to react. The decisive weakness of Apoo's ability is that if the target's ears are blocked (even if just covered with their hands) before the sound hits, said target becomes immune to his techniques (something notably facilitated by the ability to see the future), although such efforts to block out sound tend to inhibit Apoo's opponents from being able to fight properly. Furthermore, if one is outside the seemingly predetermined range of the sound (i.e., hearing range) in the first place, one will also be safe, and since Apoo aims his attacks with his sight, one can predict where the attacks will land based on where Apoo looks and thereby dodge. Due to said weaknesses, Apoo's powers are best-suited for use against first-time opponents or in surprise attacks. Apoo wields a pair of tonfas in battle, skillfully enough to clash with proficient sword (and axe) wielders. Apoo possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. He seems rather proficient with it, having used Hardening to protect himself from a Shigan attack used by a CP0 agents Guernica to pierce his neck, thereby preventing it from being a lethal blow. Apoo possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Scotch", "episode": "Episode 665", "chapter": "Chapter 591", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed by Chadros Higelyges in Chapter 666.", "appearance": "The brothers are a pair of furry giants, having long limbs and being covered in white fur all over their bodies except their fingers. It is unknown if they are actual yetis, although several characters believe them to be due to the strong parallels. Their height dwarfs that of many giants. One of the brother's footprints is larger than Brook, who stands at 277cm (9'1\"). When the pair captured Franky under Caesar Clown's orders, Scotch held his entire 240cm (7'10\") frame in just one hand. They wear blue shorts and bowler hats which are frozen from the top. Rock appears to wear either a yellow tie or scarf. So far in the series, they have been perpetually covered in shadows from the shoulders up. However, their faces have been revealed in a minibook. Rock has straight, rigidly defined facial features resembling a moai. Scotch wears a gas mask with lenses and canisters that are visible even from his silhouette.", "abilities_and_powers": "Caesar believed dispatching the brothers to be excessive to deal with the Straw Hat Pirates, so they are presumably strong and impressive fighters. They are, despite their tremendous stature, fast enough to instantly disappear from Luffy's sight and with enough subtlety to suddenly appear behind Nami and Chopper without either noticing. The pair even managed to defeat Zoro, Brook, and Sanji (in Nami's body) seemingly effortlessly (though they later admitted to ambushing them with KYP gas to immobilize them). The brothers know the environment of Punk Hazard, and possibly other arctic environments, very well, and they successfully incorporate their frigid surroundings into their fighting styles, such as shooting at icicles to dislodge them on foes and fighting on cliff edges to trick and drive their foes off it. Even with these advantages, however, they were shown to be no match for Luffy, even while he focused more on dealing with a rampaging Franky (in Chopper's body) than the brothers, in contrast to Caesar's original belief. Outside of battle, their furry bodies grant the brothers great resistance to the cold, which enables them to walk around the freezing part of Punk Hazard with nothing more than shorts and hats (which are visibly frosted over). On some colder days, however, the pair do seem to note the chill and cold. In the anime, they were able to move at speeds rivaling Soru to evade Luffy's Gear Second attacks. Despite these abilities, they do not appear to be very resilient, even for their size: It only took one heavy attack each (Rock being hit by the tip of a mountain, thrown by Franky in an uncontrolled Monster Chopper state, and Scotch hit by Law's Counter-Shock attack) before they were both knocked completely unconscious. The brothers each carry a giant-sized rifle which appears to provide their primary method of attack. The standard rounds they use are explosive, but the pair also have specialized gas rounds that can cause intoxication and/or drowsiness. Rock also mentioned they have used poison gas. Scotch wears a gas mask, which protects him from their own gas-ammunition. He was also shown to wield a large knife, though his proficiency with it is unknown as Trafalgar Law electrocuted him before he could take a swipe."},

In the anime, he was initially depicted in this outfit with lighter colored hair, silver sunglasses and a purple shirt with a yellow stripe on the collar and down each arm. 26 years ago, he initially wore a yellow t-shirt with two orange blotch-like patterns on the right side, blue pants, and a purple sash. He then wore a purple shirt, orange pants and a pale-yellow sash.", "personality": "Gaban can be very quick to get to the point, as he proposed stopping the rampaging Kozuki Oden early on before the samurai could cause more damage to the crew. He was also the first to voice the crew's dissatisfaction towards Oden after the latter joined the Roger Pirates. Gaban does not seem to care for small talk, cutting Neptune off when he started talking about Shyarly's popularity across Fish-Man Island. As a long-time member of the Roger Pirates, he understands Roger better than most and knows it is pointless to convince him to run from an enemy. Gaban seems to hold his captain to a high standard and tried to stop him from bowing his head to Whitebeard.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gaban appears to have been a prominent figure in terms of strength and authority, as he was shown leading the charge alongside Rayleigh during the crew's last battle with the Whitebeard Pirates. In the anime, Gaban was shown to be strong enough to clash on even terms with soon-to-be crewmate Kozuki Oden, one of the strongest-ever samurai from Wano.

Another sign of her love for Rebecca was when she risked her life to get food for her, which led to her own death. Though originally skeptical and distrusting about Kyros' redemption due to his past as a murderer, she came to see him as a good man after he rescued her.

{"name": "Sasaki", "episode": "Episode 977", "chapter": "Chapter 982", "year": 2020, "note": "His name and appearance were revealed in Chapter 978. He appeared shadowed in the anime in Episode 954.", "appearance": "Sasaki is a bluespine unicornfish fish-man who stands at just shy of 3.2 meters, with a portly build and light skin. He possesses sharp and slanted, blue eyes underlined by notable creases, a mildly hooked nose and a set of sharp, fanged teeth with two long bottom canines (jutting out even with his mouth closed), as well as a flat chin. His shaggy hair is colored yellowish-green and reaches down to his middle back, with a golden hoop earring visible on both his ears. A black (more grayish in the anime) tattoo is located around his shoulder areas, including the upper arms, chest, and back, with many curved, vane-like shapes bringing on a resemblance to wings. Sasaki's clothes seem a distinct blend of traditional Japanese and a military/dictator's style of attire. On his head is a military cap with a black, low-set visor and a white crown that is extra-wide, puffy, dented breadthwise with the front raised, and split by a lengthwise seam. Above the black bottom edge (spaced from it) runs a black band lined with a row of gold studs, holding in the front a golden badge depicting a double-cross shape (eight-armed, the diagonals less prominent, with a small middle stud). Set below, front and center, is a pair of slender, golden horns that curve upward, lending Sasaki (together with his fangs) a rather demonic look. Otherwise, the man wears a cloak akin to a seaman's, slung on his shoulders with the sleeves hanging back, that has a folded standup collar bearing on each side a simpler version of the hat's badge. The coat has a solid-white coloration over its upper half, which ends around waist level with a downward-facing flame motif, contrasting against the orange-colored rest of the coat. Below, Sasaki's torso is bare, partly showing off the aforesaid tattoo. For lower wear, Sasaki dons a hakama-like article resembling the bottom half of a double-breasted trench coat, which is flame-patterned the same as the cloak (but with the upper half beige-colored instead of white), closed by eight gray buttons, and held up by a golden, buckled belt. Finally, Sasaki sports a pair of brown gloves and grayish-brown, double-toothed geta sandals.", "personality": "Outside of battle, Sasaki is shown to be a rather calm and easygoing man, albeit not above derision and prone to scoff at his equal-ranking peers. Still, he acts cordial toward those he considers friends, like formerly \"Kyoshiro\", but will not tolerate any breach of fidelity; if betrayed, he will aim to ensure the traitor pays a steep price. Even when he knew that his own subordinates had been turned against him against their will due to a Devil Fruit power, Sasaki still proclaimed them as traitors and was willing to personally take them out. An ambitious man, Sasaki seeks to become one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars by claiming a spot from the current ones, causing him to disregard their senior authority. This resolve, according to King, arises from Sasaki's past as captain of his own crew, bearing out on his part a high degree of confidence in his strength, enough for him to look forward to a chance to directly challenge an All-Star. Yet, Sasaki is also prideful in his Tobiroppo status, claiming that his current group is why the Beasts Pirates are as feared as they are. As far as combat is concerned, Sasaki is proud of his ability to become a dinosaur, believing dinosaurs to be the strongest animals that ever existed. Furthermore, when he makes mistakes in battle, Sasaki is too proud to admit as much and will justify his blunders as intentional decisions on his part. This prideful attitude also extends to his enemies, as he became infuriated when Franky ran from him during their fight, calling him shameless. It is implied by Kyoshiro that Sasaki is fond of partying, since the former thought that Sasaki's presence outside the Golden Kagura was uncharacteristic of him; having a fondness for drinking as indicated by his epithet, Sasaki conducted his search for Yamato with a sake bottle in hand. However, the Tobiroppo member sees himself as above drinking with rank and file, expressing his wish to drink with none other than Kaidou.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Sasaki holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, only Kaidou himself and the All-Stars ranked above him; in particular, Sasaki leads the crew's Armored Division. Further, as an ex-pirate captain, Sasaki used to have full command over his own crew at some point. Like the other Tobiroppo, Sasaki is a powerful combatant whose strength makes him potentially worth challenging the All-Stars for their post, something Sasaki seemed confident in his ability to do. He possesses tremendous strength and stamina, which is enhanced by his fish-man heritage. Among the Tobiroppo, he has the third highest bounty at 472,000,000, indicating his threat level. Against Franky, Sasaki was able to hold his own for an extended period of time while his foe piloted his General Franky throughout the fight's duration, keeping his real body secure inside the robot. Though Sasaki was ultimately taken out by two of Franky's strongest attacks back to back, one of which exploited his weak spot as a triceratops, Sasaki was able to force Franky out of the robot with his own final attack, even destroying part of it, despite the mech being tough enough to withstand a point blank missile explosion with no damage. Sasaki's resilience was also commended by Franky, who claimed that Sasaki had survived several finishing moves throughout their fight. Sasaki ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Triceratops, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a triceratops, and hybrid form, at will. As an Ancient Zoan, this ability grants Sasaki an immense increase in physical strength, allowing him to charge into opponents with great force, enough to knock back a powerful, 13m-tall robot. Furthermore, with his hardy triceratops skin, Sasaki enjoys a notable increase in durability, enough to be unfazed by heavy, explosive artillery fire, though his less-protected belly remains as a weak spot. As a triceratops, Sasaki bears three long, pointy horns on his head. His primary method of combat is to charge at his opponents headfirst and pierce them with his horns. In his hybrid form, he also possesses the abnormal ability to make his neck frill rotate around like a propeller, greatly increasing the speed of his charges and allowing him to simulate flight. Sasaki possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit. For combat, Sasaki wields a special sword that he dubs as Karakuri Rasento. It is equipped with a rotational mechanism that allows the blade to spin at high speeds whenever Sasaki activates it, with a series of small blade flaps, perpendicularly set to the main blade, making it like a portable drill. With the Rasento, Sasaki can easily cut and shred opponents or their weapons, including other swords, and by using it in tandem with his Zoan transformation (particularly his rotating neck frill), Sasaki can perform a powerful, aerial style of swordplay that can easily overwhelm unseasoned enemy swordsmen."},

His normal demeanor is known to dissolve into panicking when his plans go awry, as he became frantic once Luffy and Sanji bypassed his pitfalls and defeated him. Like many One Piece characters, he has his own distinctive Laughter Style: \"Ho, ho hoooo!\"", "abilities_and_powers": "Satori was the priest in charge of testing intruders with the Ordeal of Balls, with a survival rate of 10%. As part of his Ordeal of Balls, Satori uses what he calls Surprise Clouds (, Bikkurigumo?), large ball clouds that float around the area, as his main weapon. These balls contain a wide variety of items, ranging from largely harmless (flowers, songbirds) to genuinely dangerous (poisonous snakes, explosives, bladed weapons). As the balls are outwardly identical, his opponents can never be sure of their contents, forcing them to constantly evade them. Satori has a pair of Impact Dials bound beneath his gloves; like all Impact Dials, these can absorb the force of an opponent's attacks and re-release it as a powerful shockwave. (Curiously, he appears to use these against the Straw Hats multiple times without intercepting any attacks beforehand, suggesting he may be carrying several pre-charged Dials.) Satori can use Kenbunshoku Haki, which is called \"Mantra\" in Skypiea, to predict what his opponent will do before they attack. Like the other priests, he can sense the presence of people within a range that covers the entirety of Upper Yard. However, Satori admits that he still requires more training, as his concentration can falter due to unexpected events, leaving him vulnerable. As with Kenbunshoku Haki, his \"Mantra\" is useless if he is restrained, as he cannot dodge blows whether he predicts them or not."},

He has red-and-white striped gloves and pants with the same pattern alongside a gold belt. On Sarquiss' bare chest is a tattoo of Doflamingo's Jolly Roger: a smiley with a cancel symbol. He also has the symbol on his belt. When he was younger, he did not wear glasses, he wore a yellow sleeved shirt, a dark red jacket, and carried a sword on his back.", "personality": "As far as personality is concerned, Sarquiss appears to not be very bright, but just as over-confident and self-absorbed as the rest of the pirates in Bellamy's crew. He was somewhat classy and prejudiced as he gave Luffy, Zoro, and Nami some money as a pity so they could buy decent clothes. He interpreted Zoro and Luffy's refusal to fight back when Bellamy challenged them at Terry's bar as an act of cowardice, and insisted that Bellamy's quick defeat at Luffy's hands was a \"lucky shot\" and even attempted to challenge the younger pirate, only to cringe once the Straw Hat captain finally gave Sarquiss his attention. Unfortunately he did not seem to learn from this, as soon after Luffy leaves, he ends up bumping into Blackbeard and made a rude remark towards him and continues to badmouth Luffy, to which the captain promptly smashes Sarquiss into the ground. Just like his captain, he strongly believes that a New Age is coming and laughs at anyone who mentions their dreams. He also falsely believes that a bounty serves as a rating of a person's fighting level, making him believe himself to be a more powerful fighter than he truly is.", "abilities_and_powers": "Sarquiss possesses a bounty of 38,000,000, an indication of his danger. He seems to be quite agile, but Cricket outclassed him and Blackbeard defeated him with great ease. Sarquiss uses a giant dagger, which resembles a giant kukri, to fight. It's what gave him his nickname: \"Big-Knife\" Sarquiss. He usually spins the blade like a windmill in front of him, as to show off. From his one named technique, Sarquiss shows certain acrobatic skills. During the time the Bellamy Pirates were still in North Blue, Sarquiss wielded a katana on his back."},
{"name": "Sanji", "episode": "Episode 43", "chapter": "Chapter 20", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "Sanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two-year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip. Among Sanji's physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows curl in the opposite direction from his siblings, whose eyebrows curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the left side). Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to right side). During his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic modifications awakened, Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his siblings' (i.e., to the left side). After being unconscious for a brief period, when he awoke, his eyebrows had returned to their original shape. When fighting S-Shark, his eyebrows changed direction again. While Sanji's eyes usually seem black, he was depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller Bark Arc. This is shown again during the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar Law switched Sanji into Nami's body, and her usual brown eyes became grey blue in color. Sanji almost always wears a black, double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a tie together with a long-sleeved buttoned shirt of varying colors, usually orange, blue, turquoise, or black, with or without pinstripes. His outfit changes on a more frequent basis than most of the crew. As a child, Sanji wore a yellow shirt with the number \"3\" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a light-yellow bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the opposite manner as it is in the present. During the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown coat with furry outlining. During the Arabasta Arc, he wore blue jacket-like attire suited for the desert in addition to orange sunglasses. During the Skypiea Arc, he wore a pink dotted shirt with black knee-length pants. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, he wore a lavender shirt with a blue tie. During the Water 7 Arc, he did not wear a suit jacket, but a black vest over an orange, pinstriped shirt. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a darker lavender shirt with a red tie. During the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore a dark blue shirt with a light blue tie, as well as his usual black suit jacket and trousers. During the Straw Hats' separation, Sanji was coerced into dressing as a typical okama, wearing a pink dress with short puffy sleeves. He also wore a long blond curly wig, nail polish, a pair of woman's undergarments, and heavy, trashy makeup. He was also seen with a pair of high heels. He later reverts to his usual outfit and appearance sometime after that. He also wears dress shoes, mostly for his Black Leg Style. These shoes are extremely durable and were designed to increase the power of his attacks, though he can attack sufficiently without them as shown in his fight against Kuroobi. Sanji is also a chain-smoker and is rarely seen without a cigarette. After the two-year timeskip, Sanji now covers his right eye, shows his left eye, and has grown his hair just slightly longer. He also sports a dark anchor style facial hair, and stubble on his upper lip. Sanji's neck has gotten thicker as well, similar to Luffy and Zoro. He has grown taller, and therefore remains nearly the exact same height as Zoro. He wears a black double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a yellow dress shirt together with a brown tie. In Punk Hazard, he wears a full black double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a grey dress shirt together with a very light grey tie. While on Punk Hazard, Kin'emon used his Fuku Fuku no Mi ability to give Sanji a double-breasted coat for the cold, as he was trapped in Nami's body because of Trafalgar Law. During the Dressrosa Arc, Sanji first wore a white dress shirt which he wore untucked, with a black tie, black trousers and a black, pinstriped waistcoat. Upon going incognito into Acacia, he wore a black double-breasted suit, with a white shirt with the top button undone. In the anime he wears a blue tie as well. He also wore black glasses and a fake white beard and mustache. After being injured by Doflamingo, Sanji wore bandages around his chest and wore his shirt and suit jacket unbuttoned and over his shoulders. After arriving on Zou, Sanji sported a pair of sunglasses (with his hair still covering one of the glasses) an orange leather jacket, yellow trousers and a small backpack. He also slightly trimmed his beard. Later, he wore a black fur-trimmed coat over a dress shirt, and a beaded necklace. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Sanji wore a white, frilled dress shirt as well as his usual black dress pants and shoes; he keeps the collar of the shirt upturned and the first few buttons undone. Later, his wrists are each fitted with a gold exploding wristlet (later revealed to be fakes), and his face is discretely covered by a transparent hi-tech mask given to him by his sister, to remove the facial swelling he received during a violent confrontation with his brothers. Once he departed for Whole Cake Chateau with his family, he was also clad in a red, single-shoulder royal cape held together with a golden chain and clasp. During the Tea Party, he wore a white tuxedo, comprising a dress shirt and ascot under a white vest, white trousers and shoes, and an open formal coat with a raised collar. After finishing the second wedding cake, Sanji disguised himself as one of the WCI 31 chefs by wearing a chef hat and a rag. During the Levely Arc, Sanji wore a dark long sleeve shirt with a light tie, dark pants, and a bandage wrapped around his right arm. In the Wano Country Arc, Sanji was given a yellow and white stripped yukata by Kin'emon with a top knot the same as Luffy and Zoro. Later, he dons the raid suit that was given to him by his family, which gives Sanji a presumably black Germa outfit and cape with the number 3 on it, as well as jet-propelled boots. Uniquely, it also gives him a mask to wear over his nose and mouth, as well as a pair of sunglasses and a set of earphones on the top of his head. It also slicks the front of his hair into two parts, one pointing up and one pointing down. During the raid on Onigashima, Sanji wore a red suit, black shirt, and red tie before briefly changing into a Beasts Pirates attire with the help of Kin'emon's Devil Fruit power. During the Egghead Arc, Sanji wears a hooded Hawaiian shirt, a pair of shorts with the name Vegapunk written on the side, an earpiece, and a pair of DOM Shoes. In the Movie 2, he initially appears he appears with a blue two-tone swimsuit. After the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a white tuxedo with a red rose on the flap from a wedding store. Then he changes his clothes for a green jacket, with a gray shirt underneath, and black pants. In the Movie 3, he wears a dark brown jacket, with the chest area exposed, a white collar, and black pants. He also wears his orange glasses during the plot. Also momentarily, he wears an extravagant panda costume designed by Usopp. During the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white chef hat."},

{"name": "Sanjuan Wolf", "episode": "Episode 575", "chapter": "Chapter 484", "year": 2010, "note": "His was first mentioned by Emporio Ivankov in Chapter 538.", "appearance": "Thanks at least in part to his Devil Fruit, Wolf is a giant of extraordinary size, as high at 180m at least, towering over even the largest beings known to date like Oars or Little Oars Jr., as well as being so big that he appears to be roughly the same size as the Marine Headquarters at Marineford. His true size, however, is still unknown. The shape of his head and the disposition of his brown beard resemble a chestnut, making his spiky, round and beige hair resemble a chestnut shell. His facial features include round eyes with dark lines around them, along with eyelash-like marks, similar to those found on Franky's face, that point downward. He wears his prison uniform from Impel Down and he is always barefoot. After the timeskip, Wolf now wears clothing of a similar style to the Giants of Elbaf, lacking an upper body garment but wearing dark pants with a large, studded belt with a skull buckle, as well as a dark cape fastened over his right pectoral with a light medallion.", "personality": "Although known for committing crimes that caused his existence to be erased from history, he seems to have a playful attitude, as seen when commenting that he was found when he was trying to hide behind Marine Headquarters. He is also quite shy, as he acts scared when people realize who he is and continued hiding while the rest of the crew fought Whitebeard. In fact, he was the only person there who did not fight in the war. He is also prone to complaining, as shown when the Blackbeard Pirates headed to the New World. Despite his complaining and lack of participation, he is shown to be very loyal to Blackbeard. He is shown to be a heavy sleeper as he napped in the daytime during a prison break in Hachinosu.", "abilities_and_powers": "Wolf's abilities have not yet been shown, but he was powerful enough to be contained in Level 6 of Impel Down when caught by the World Government, where even Emporio Ivankov pointed him out as one of the most dangerous prisoners. Another testament to his power is the fact that when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he was one of the people that survived the battle royale, making him one of the strongest prisoners. After the timeskip, has since become one of Blackbeard's \"Ten Titanic Captains\" that personally guard the Emperor, gaining great authority over their Seventh Ship and everyone on it. As a giant, Wolf ages a lot slower than a human and has immense strength, though he was still defeated by Marine veteran Monkey D. Garp rather quickly. However, this could be becuase he was asleep at the time and was caught off guard. Despite his tremendous size, he is considerably stealthy, able to somehow reach Marineford without being detected until he was right behind the Marine Headquarters building and made himself known. Wolf ate the Deka Deka no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that makes him much bigger than normal giants. Despite being weak against water, he was tall enough to stand in the ocean, though Wolf did mention that doing so was exhausting to him, probably due to the Devil Fruit he had eaten."},

He also wore red sunglasses with blue lenses.", "personality": "He is greedy and opportunistic, kidnapping humans in order to exhibit them, and then taking advantage of Brook's mercy to kidnap him for the same reasons. Sancrin shows that he did not believe in devils and occult, as he was not afraid of Brook of being a skeleton, despite not knowing he was a Devil Fruit user at the time. When Brook was planning to retire from the rock band industry to return to his crew, Sancrin was fully willing to betray him to the Marines to gain some last minute benefit (the bounty on Brook's head) and revenge, and even held him at gunpoint to prevent him from escaping, proving himself to be a very treacherous man.", "abilities_and_powers": "During the timeskip, Sancrin managed to make Brook a world-class star, proving himself to be a good manager.

Though it can be difficult to see for his hat, he does not seem to have any outer ears. After the two year timeskip, he has grown much taller while retaining his usual outfit, now fitted for his increase in size. His facial appearance has not changed much from two years previously however. As a child, he had a shaved head. He sported a white long sleeve button up shirt with a black stripe near the stomach.

As a child, she wore a black headband and dress. She also had black shoes, and hair that covered her eyes. She is depicted as standing next to a small make-shift grave, mourning over a hamster.", "personality": "Sadi is a sadistic woman who enjoys bringing pain and torture to others, including Marine allies, and can not seem to get enough of their screams, getting sexually excited hearing them. However, her over the top reactions and flamboyant behaviour cause her to be more of a comical character rather than a sexual one. She also seems to have extreme pride in the virtually perfect defenses of Impel Down, and refused the assistance offered by the Marines. She also tends to put \"mmmmm--!?\" in the middle of her sentences, and insists on being addressed as Little Sadi (Sadi-chan?), much as a dominatrix would insist on being addressed as \"Mistress\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Sadi is a chief guard of Impel Down with some authority over lower ranking subordinates. Being in command over the Four Jailer Beasts, she is considered \"stronger than four of them combined\", much that they cower in fear whenever the sadist gets angry. During her fight with Ivankov, she was shown to have amazing evasive abilities and was able to keep up with the okama's speed. The pitchfork she carries around conceals a custom-designed whip which she can use adeptly.

{"name": "Sai", "episode": "Episode 704", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Sai is a thick built man with shaggy brown hair and sideburns. He has an unusually smooth and tubular torso, and in spite of his muscular strength he lacks defined abs, or a belly button. He sports a dark green cape with a white frill collar. He wears puffy blue and yellow thick-striped pants (green in the manga) and black shoes. He has the number \"13\" tattooed on his left side just below his ribs, similar to the tattoo of the number \"12\" his grandfather has, representing that he is the 13th leader of the Happo Navy. When transformed into a toy, he appears as a monkey bearing cymbals. He has rounded teeth and a well-defined lower jaw. He wears a bow tie, sunglasses, a striped hat, and a pair of pants that resemble those he wore as a human. Surprisingly while most toys were not at all reminiscent of their true forms, Sai was one of the only people whose toy appearance vaguely resembled their human self.", "personality": "Sai strongly believes in honesty and fairness, as he stood up for Luffy when he was about to be unfairly disqualified. He is very emotional and has a habit of overreacting whenever he rejects something, repeatedly insisting there is no need for it before turning belligerent toward the offering party. This also goes for apologizing, as he threw himself on his knees and begged for forgiveness from a Colosseum doctor after having already apologized three times. Saiis responsible, being quick to restrain his grandfather's rash attack on Luffy (in disguise as Lucy) and Cavendish so that it would not interfere with their true goal at the tournament. Sai is thoroughly dedicated to his training in the Hasshoken, notably restraining his natural brotherly emotions towards Boo in order to remain focused in battle. However, as the commander of the Happo Army, he is also mindful of and fully dedicated to towards his comrades in arms, and will ruthlessly avenge their defeat. Sai is also compassionate with a very strong sense of honor, even towards his enemies, as when Baby 5 tried to commit suicide (due to his request) he immediately tried to stop her, claiming that was not how he wanted to win. His compassion was shown further when he was enraged at Lao G's insults to Baby 5 and his grandfather. When Pica ruthlessly attacked Baby 5 for treachery, he wasted no time in pushing Baby 5 to safety and taking the full brunt of Pica's attack himself. When Leo tried to save Shirahoshi from Charlos,Sai quickly went to back up the dwarf, showing that he is willing to defy even the World Nobles to help people despite the consequences of doing so. Like many One Piece characters, Sai also has a unique laugh: Kakakaka.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the 13th Commander of the Happo Navy, Sai has authority over all his subordinates and is undoubtfully a powerful fighter. He was able to defeat the Funk Brothers, who are capable of defeating pirates with bounties of over 100 million, with a single kick. He was later able to defeat Lao G, a Donquixote executive who defeated his grandfather easily with a single Haki-embedded kick that shattered the ground around them. Even Chinjao, an ex-pirate with a bounty of over 500 million, acknowledged that Sai had managed to surpass him in strength. After seeing his destructive power even Roronoa Zoro noted his ability and decided to remember his name for the future. Due to his dedicated training in Hasshoken, Sai attained tremendous physical prowess as well as immense skill in the unique martial art which generates vibrations in physical strikes, and Sai personally had an emphasis in using vibration enhanced kicks. Along with Boo, he was able to restrain back his enraged grandfather, although it is probable that Chinjao didn't exert himself fully as he did not wish to harm his grandchildren. Sai is powerful enough to handle and excel against the dangers of the New World, to the extent of being chosen as the 13th Commander of the Happo Navy in succession of the legendary Chinjao. In the Block C battle royale of the Corrida Colosseum, he demonstrated incredible agility to effortlessly dodge the assault of the combined Funk Brothersand defeat themin one blow, as well as spar evenly with Ideo, a boxer powerful enough to launch a giant out of the ring with a single punch. Although Luffy knocked Sai easily out of the arena with a Gear 2nd kick, the attack was a surprise that caught him off guard, and he was shown to be conscious and fine in the waters right after. He also took a kick to the face from Rob Lucci and shrugged it off. Sai's true strength is later seen when he was able to effortlessly bend Chinjao's Haki-coated head (an incredible feat done only by Garp and Luffy before him) and during his fight with Lao G when he was able to both defeat him easily and split the entire hill in two simply from the aftershock of his attack. His grandfather stated that with this, Sai should be able to break through the ice sheets in the same way that he did 30 years ago. Sai possesses Busoshoku Haki as demonstrated when he coated his leg with Haki against Chinjao and Lao G. He also is skilled enough to coat large portions of his body with Haki in order to protect himself from being crushed by Pica. In the anime, when defeating Lao G, Sai's Haki emitted a green flame-like aura around his foot in conjunction with the usual black-skin effect of Busoshoku Haki. Sai possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Sai was seen using a sword when attempting to lunge at Luffy. It is currently unknown how skilled he is at using this weapon. In the fight at Block C, he used a bladed polearm proficiently. Sai acrobatically hurls himself at his enemy by balancing on his polearm and swinging himself in their direction, in a manner similar to pole vaulting. Sai can use the momentum generated by such an assault to land kicks and other attacks on his foes."},
{"name": "Sakazuki", "episode": "Episode 397", "chapter": "Chapter 278", "year": 2006, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nico Robin in Chapter 319. His real name was revealed in Chapter 397. Formerly known by his admiral alias Akainu.", "appearance": "Sakazuki is an incredibly tall, light-skinned, unusually muscular man (the most muscular of the former admirals and being on par with Sengoku and Garp). He's about as tall as his fellow admirals, with a square-shaped face, very pronounced facial features, and short black hair. He stands at 306cm (10'), making him taller than other massive characters like Jinbe, who is 301cm. He usually wears a standard Marine cap and sports a crimson, double-breasted suit, decorated with what appears to be a pink rose on his left buttonhole. Unlike many high-ranking Marines, he does not wear a tie, but instead leaves his light red colored flower-patterned shirt unbuttoned, showing his muscular neck and part of his tattoo. He wears black gloves and black shoes. The tattoo on the left side of his chest is black (light blue in the anime), containing numerous images of flowers integrated into its design. Sakazuki's tattoo has flame-shaped edges, and it extends from the admiral's left shoulder to his hip, covering part of his back and ribs. He has another, smaller tattoo in the shape of a black sword on his right deltoids and a small part of the biceps. In the anime, his eye color is seen to be brown, and this was also shown in a colored drawing by Eiichiro Oda. In his youth, Sakazuki wore an open red shirt, as well as a set of khaki pants held up with a loosely tied yellow-orange ribbed belt with a silver bullseye shaped buckle, and a pair of red sneakers. He also carried a katana on his back. Twenty-two years ago, at the Ohara Incident, he wore a simple white Marine cap under a dark gray hood that seemed to be a part of a cloak he wore beneath his suit, or Marine coat. Until getting off his chair in order to destroy an incoming iceberg during the Summit War of Marineford, his face was always hidden by the bill of his cap. As a child, Sakazuki still had the grim disposition he retained as an adult. He also wore tattered clothes and carried a dagger. He wore a cap similar to the Marines' cap he would don in the future, except it has the kanji for \"justice\" instead. After the timeskip, as a result of his intense battle with Kuzan at Punk Hazard, the right side of Sakazuki's neck and face are scarred, and a chunk of his right ear is missing. In addition to his injuries, he also grew a mustache and goatee. He has also replaced his trademark red suit for a white one, similar to what Sengoku wore when he was Fleet Admiral; however, Sakazuki still wears the same floral pattern shirt underneath and does not wear his black signature gloves. He continues to wear the standard Marine cap, though unlike his predecessor's, it does not have the life-sized seagull on top. He is also frequently seen smoking a cigar. Later during the Wano Country Arc, he appears to be wearing a darker suit once more, possibly a red one like his pre-timeskip suit.", "personality": "While he is a strong and capable leader who has done well to consolidate the power and prestige of the Marines, Sakazuki would be best categorized as an extremist and highly dogmatic. He is an adamant believer in Absolute Justice and is ruthless in his maintenance of it, his derived motto being \"Thorough Justice\" (, Tetteiteki na Seigi?). He has a stern, dead-serious disposition, is grim, expressionless, and was the most ruthless out of three admirals pre-timeskip. This has given him a very fearsome reputation, but of greater concern is his dogmatism, which may end up making the Marines into a force that is worse than the enemies they hope to eliminate. Despite this disposition, Sakazuki seems to be able to restrain himself at times, having chosen to spare the life of Jewelry Bonney and her crew after they were left beaten and tied by the Blackbeard Pirates for the then-admiral to salvage, and letting his colleague Aokiji leave the Marines after he lost a ten-day duel for the position of fleet admiral. During the Buster Call attack on Ohara, Sakazuki's beliefs led him to go as far as destroying a refugee ship full of innocent people and Marines simply because of the slight possibility that a scholar could be hiding on board, an action that disgusted Vice-Admiral Kuzan (who called him a \"fool\" and an \"idiot\" for overdoing things). Sakazuki's logic was that if even one of the scholars of Ohara had escaped with it, the entire mission would have been a failure. His extremism has given him a borderline, if not outright fanatic demeanor. He is incredibly rigid and absolute in his beliefs, showing little compassion for anyone or anything, and is ruthlessly willing to do whatever it takes to serve his own goals, no matter the cost. He mostly sees the Marines as an extension of himself and his own beliefs, willing to kill those who disagree with him, and showing little if any care for people placed under his charge. While this has made him extremely powerful and feared among pirates, the same fear inspires discontent and loathing by his own men, causing him to lose a very useful and powerful ally in Kuzan because of it. Garp was also enraged that his fanatic obsession for destroying pirates resulted in the death of Ace and the near death of Luffy, though it is unclear if a rift between them has further deepened or caused further dissent among Marines who believe in either's viewpoint. The best example of his absolutism is when he attempted to kill Koby for his plea to stop the war, only to be stopped by the timely arrival of Shanks. His extremism also caused him to bar Admiral Fujitora from ever entering a Marine base due to his prostration in Dressrosa, though it was mostly because Sakazuki could not stand to see his version of justice and honor shamed because his enemies showcased its own failure. Fujitora rightly pointed out that Sakazuki's version of Justice had no credibility or honor in the first place if it was that fragile, which only inflamed Sakazuki's rage further, seeing it as a personal slight. Additionally, he has no tolerance for Marines who desert their posts, to which the only consolation he does offer is that they should not dishonor their families by running away. Caesar Clown also believed that Sakazuki would desire his ideas of mass-murder weapons and inhumane experimentation on prisoners, in contrast to the more pragmatic Sengoku. To Akainu, any Marine who is not willing to fight for justice is not worthy of being called a Marine. Despite all of this, even Sakazuki could not come to kill his former compatriot, Kuzan. As Fleet Admiral, Sakazuki holds immense pride in the name of the Marines. For example, when he learned that Fujitora had let the world know of what transpired in Dressrosa, Sakazuki was furious. His pride is so great he would rather cover up the ordeal to ensure that the Marines are adamant and credible to his doctrine of Absolute Justice. This conceited behavior even led to him yelling at the Five Elders for declaring Doflamingo's resignation from the Warlords of the Sea as a false report, as he knew the world's confusion would damage their trust in the Marines as well as the Marines' reputation. This shows that he does know the value of public trust, but thinks more in terms of the shame losing it brings to the Marines, rather than the morale and good standing of his men. Despite the importance of his position, he found it rather frustrating that it prevented him from entering the battlefield himself. Despite his position as an admiral prior to promotion, Akainu is willing to lie to and deceive his enemies in order to achieve Justice. So far, Akainu's manipulations have been incredibly successful, such as when he managed to deceive Squard through Sengoku's master strategy, or insulting Whitebeard to get Ace angry enough to stop his attempt at escape. He finds people who attempt to interfere with him as nothing more than irritating obstacles. Furthermore, he seems to be unafraid of older legends, as when Whitebeard told his men not to be intimidated by Garp due to the Marine being an old man, Akainu mocked Whitebeard's comment, saying that Whitebeard was also from the same generation as Garp before attacking the Emperor. While other Marines such as Sengoku and Garp share a decent amount of respect for their accomplished enemies, Akainu has no such empathy, instead disparaging them at every chance he gets. Prior to Sengoku making it public, Akainu was one of the few who knew that Luffy was Dragon's son. It is unknown if he has some past relationship with Dragon, or if it was simply common knowledge among the higher-ranking Marines that Dragon is Garp's son. As such, Akainu deems that Luffy's mere existence, due to being Dragon's son, is enough to be a threat to the world and therefore must be eliminated. In fact, Akainu's beliefs about heritage run deep enough that he declares that even if every other pirate escape, he would personally ensure that neither Ace nor Luffy were allowed to leave the war alive due to their bloodlines. This conviction fueled Akainu to the point of actively hunting Luffy himself, even though Blackbeard was destroying Marineford at the time. Sakazuki does not see it as the business of the World Nobles to interfere with the Marines' activities and vice versa. This was proven during his confrontation with the Five Elders, where he disparages them for permitting the Celestial Dragons' CP0 to falsify Donquixote Doflamingo's resignation from the Warlords of the Sea, even questioning whether the Five Elders are the Celestial Dragons' puppets. Surprisingly, Sakazuki can demonstrate sense of caution in regard to battling pirates or causing disturbances in global affairs. This was seen when he did not attempt to attack Shanks when he arrived at Marineford to save Koby. Also, despite Borsalino's request to travel to Wano Country to deal with the possible alliance of the Beasts Pirates and Big Mom Pirates, he declines it citing that Wano's military strength is an unknown factor and they are not within their jurisdiction. However, he considers being Fleet Admiral frustrating when he is forced to wait for the conclusion of the Blackbeard Pirates and Heart Pirates' battle. Akainu also tells his subordinates to not let Rob Lucci fight Luffy until Kizaru arrives at Egghead.", "abilities_and_powers": "As fleet admiral, Sakazuki has total operational command of the Marines, with at present only six direct superiors to answer to: the World Government's Five Elders and Commander-in-Chief. On top of any prior-held authorities as admiral (e.g., issuing special orders like the enactment of a Buster Call on any island he deems a threat, at any time, and granting others such privilege), Sakazuki can now fully lay down the organization's strategy, decide tactics and set policy, discretionally assign and reassign forces to deploy globally in missions (including the admirals), promote or demote the lower ranks, and delegate any such powers as he sees fit; during the two-year timeskip, he exercised his authority to have the Marine Headquarters relocated to the New World as well as institute a global-scale draft. In terms of combat, Sakazuki as the current fleet admiral is among the world's strongest figures, having been held with his fellow admirals as the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\" (i.e., the strongest individual combatants that it can offer, feared by criminals the world over). Sakazuki's background, specifically as a black-hearted extremist, affords him a particularly fearsome repute even by admiral standards, as seen chiefly following the Summit War when Blackbeard, upon learning of Sakazuki's presence aboard a Marine ship meant for negotiations, immediately fled off the island he dwelt on with his crew, noting their unreadiness to face the admiral despite Blackbeard, at that point, having come to wield two of the strongest Devil Fruit powers in existence and bolstered his crew with five of Impel Down's most dangerous and powerful ex-prisoners. During the Summit War, Sakazuki's fighting prowess was well-established against Whitebeard, an Emperor and the world's strongest man, whom the admiral matched up to in a head-to-head confrontation. While Whitebeard managed to gain the upper hand against and delivered a serious blow to Sakazuki in their second clash, the admiral did the same and melted off half of Whitebeard's face in exchange. After being left to fall into a chasm caused by the enraged Emperor's quakes, Sakazuki would soon recover and reenter the battle. Further during the war, Sakazuki proved himself firmly superior to Ace, one of Whitebeard's strongest division commanders despite his young age, effortlessly overpowering Ace in a clash; beforehand, Ace had more or less soundly fended off Aokiji (though in fairness, Sakazuki enjoyed the inherent superiority of his own ability over Ace's, unlike the other admiral). Soon following Whitebeard's rage-fueled onslaught on him, Sakazuki reemerged in what still seemed perfect fighting condition, managing to take down in little time, with utmost ease, a Revolutionary Army commander and deputy commander simultaneously, then another of Whitebeard's commanders. Ultimately, Sakazuki proved to be so unstoppable that not even the likes of Jinbe (a former Warlord of the Sea), both Marco and Vista at once (two of Whitebeard's strongest men), and later (despite Sakazuki's injuries) the collective of most of Whitebeard's commanders (minus Ace and Jozu), alongside some of Whitebeard's subordinate captains and Crocodile (yet another ex-Warlord), could do anything more than slow down the admiral, merely stalling for time in Luffy's escape from him. It took another Emperor, Shanks, to appear and personally stop Sakazuki for him to desist from his pursuit. Ultimately, Sakazuki left the war with no wounds other than those dealt by Whitebeard. Sakazuki would later find his equal in then-fellow admiral Kuzan, their one-on-one duel on Punk Hazard seeing them evenly matched and meeting another blow for blow through most of a ten-day duration; while both men sustained grievous injuries, Sakazuki was the one to prevail and emerge as the victor, with his longtime comrade supposedly left at his mercy. Attesting to Sakazuki's perceived leadership competencies and military acumen, he had many dignitaries of the government strongly push for him to succeed Sengoku as fleet admiral, over the latter's personal nomination of Kuzan. While known, feared, and disdained by some for his hardline, over-the-top methods, Sakazuki's prowess as a leader is undeniable. Indeed, as noted by Jinbe, the Marine HQ under him has grown far stronger and more determined than ever before, despite the resignations of Kuzan, Sengoku, and Garp, thus bearing out Sakazuki's capabilities. Beside combat, Sakazuki is a shrewd manipulator, using whatever knowledge he holds of enemies to try to deceive them into doing what conforms with his goals. He feigned sympathy to Squard, exploiting his hatred of the late Pirate King to influence him into betraying his loyalty to Whitebeard, and later purposefully insulted Whitebeard's honor to goad Ace into attacking him, successfully doing so as to prevent Ace from escaping, and killing him shortly after by aiming for his younger brother and letting Ace take the blow in the former's stead. As with all admirals, Sakazuki's physical prowess is immense. His raw physical strength was enough for him to go up against and clash evenly with Whitebeard in close quartersthe \"Strongest Man in the World\" who, in his old age, could still overpower a giant's strength easily. Using a single leg, Sakazuki held back a two-handed swing of the elder's large naginata, which came clad in a quake bubble to massively enhance its power. Perhaps most impressive, however, are Sakazuki's vast durability and endurance, best illustrated by how not even two successive, point-blank quake punches from Whitebeard (one to his neck and another to his midsection, and both coming imbued with Haki, further increasing damage) could keep him down, the second blow strong enough to split the island of Marineford in two as a side-effect (in retrospect, a relatively weaker version of the same quake attack had sufficed to incapacitate a vice admiral giant). Sakazuki retained not only consciousness thereafter but had enough strength left to keep on fighting without at any point evincing exhaustion or impediment by injury, with only some bleeding visible on his face. Another testament to his stamina, endurance, and willpower is Sakazuki's face-off against Kuzan, in which he equaled the other admiral for ten days total, in the process of which both men suffered heavy injuries; despite the sheer amount of time their duel took to settle, Sakazuki emerged the decisive winner over Kuzan. Otherwise, Sakazuki has shown himself quite fast, using his powers to propel himself forward at great speeds. He can easily gain ground on others that are noticeably fast and in flight from him, as seen with Jinbe whom the admiral caught up with swiftly despite the former's head start that resulted from the powerful people trying to keep Sakazuki at bay. Additionally, the admiral has shown acute hearing, able to perceive underwater movements from afar. Sakazuki ate the Magu Magu no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into magma. His magma is extremely hot and highly explosive, thus making it well-suited for combat, allowing Sakazuki to burn, melt, and destroy anything in his pathin fact, among all Devil Fruits, Sakazuki's is said to offer the greatest attack power. Sakazuki's primary method of combat is transforming his arms into magma to launch burning punches (or clawed thrusts) that can easily penetrate human bodies, drastically enlarge his arms to throw forward giant magma fists meant to reach enemies farther away, and even launch multiple magma fists as a barrage of meteor-like projectiles, devastating the battlefield. Otherwise, he has been seen shaping his magma fist into a fanged dog head, as a nod to his animal motif. Beside the invulnerability of Sakazuki's magma body against all but Haki attacks, its heat has enemies heavily discouraged from coming near and striking him physically, lest they be burned. Also, his powers bestow him high maneuverability; he can melt himself through anything in his path, even tunneling through the very ground, and can briefly fly using jet bursts of magma to propel himself. Even for a Logia, this ability has great potential and power; when used excessively by Sakazuki for ten days, it warped the very climate of half an island, permanently rendering it a blazing inferno that embroils even the surrounding sea. As the fleet admiral of the marines, Sakazuki is a highly skilled Haki user. During the Summit War, Sakazuki was seen using advanced-grade Busoshoku Haki to block and disperse a long-distance quake shockwave sent out by Whitebeard, by generating, with his fellow admirals, an emitted shield combination of their three Haki to disperse said shockwave. Sakazuki possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Sakazuki was seen wielding a dagger as a child and a red-hilted katana during his youth as a Marine."},
{"name": "Sabo", "episode": "Episode 583", "chapter": "Chapter 494", "year": 2010, "note": "He was first mentioned by Portgas D. Ace in Chapter 574.", "appearance": "Sabo was a ten-year-old boy at the time of Luffy's flashback, the same age as Ace at that time. He had round eyes, a missing tooth, and short curly blond hair. He wore a large black top hat with a pair of blue goggles wrapped around it, a blue jacket with the sleeves rolled up, a cravat and a pair of light blue cyan shorts held up by a belt with an elaborate flower-design buckle. Before he entered into the Gray Terminal, he was seen with a gentle outfit with a white colored short-sleeved shirt and wearing blue colored shorts as usual. As an adult, Sabo became taller and more muscular. He has matured greatly, with more pronounced facial symmetry and a scar he acquired over his left eye, which was inflicted when Saint Jalmack selfishly blew up the fishing boat Sabo used to set out to sea, leaving him with serious burns and critical injuries. He resembles Luffy enough to allow him to easily deceive opponents as perceptive as Diamante into thinking he was \"Lucy\" by simply wearing the same outfit, although Sabo is still taller than his younger brother. His hair has also grown noticeably longer since his youth, which he styled deliberately to cover up his eye scar. While participating in the final round at the Corrida Colosseum in Luffy's place, he wore Luffy's cape, fake beard, and viking style helmet. In addition, he wore shades to conceal his eyes. He also drew an X-shaped mark on his chest. Later, after the round, he returned to his original outfit, which resembles his old outfit from twelve years ago: a long black jacket with a buckle on the left sleeve, with a blue shirt and vest, a frilled cravat, and a simple belt holding a pair of loosen light-blue pants with black boots (said boots are shown in greater detail in Pirate Warriors 3, to be wrapped with buckles and with cloth bracings). He also wears a pair of brown gloves and the same top hat with goggles over the band.", "personality": "Sabo is devoted to his dreams to the point that he agreed with Ace that the two of them had to kill Luffy so that he could not tell anyone about their treasure, though neither Ace nor Sabo knew how to kill a person nor had any experience, implying some degree of innocence despite their profession. He is very ashamed of being a noble, and even stated that he wished that he had not been born as one. According to Luffy, Sabo is a nicer older brother than Ace. He acknowledged Luffy's powers, and even encouraged his improvement. He helped Ace and Luffy get along when they were fighting, thus being the nice, diplomatic one of the trio. Sabo's dream involves traveling around the world as a pirate. This is in order to write a book containing the story of everything he would see and every place he would visit during his journey. One of the reasons behind all this could be the \"segregation\" that envelopes so much of the Goa Kingdom, a thing that could easily stir a freedom-loving spirit like Sabo's to ask himself what the world was really like outside the walls of High Town, and outside the island itself. However, he was ready to cast aside his dream for the sake of his loved ones. Sabo was loyal to his friends and, in this case his two \"brothers\", to the point that he would give in to the demands of his father, becoming miserable and \"alone\" in order to save both Luffy and Ace. After reawakening his memories, Sabo did not leave the Revolutionary Army to resume his dream as a free-sailing pirate, as he seems to remain convicted to the Army's causes. Despite being the son of a noble, Sabo does not act like a stereotypical noble would act, nor does he consider himself to be a noble. He does not look down on the less fortunate nor does he put on airs about his status. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the citizens of noble birth in Goa Kingdom including his family, who see their status as more important than anything else and will do whatever it takes to raise their social standing or maintain their current status, as well as look down on anyone they consider to be inferior. Sabo rejects these values completely, and even went as far as to say that he feels ashamed of his status as a noble. This can be seen as the reason why he ran away from home and went to live in the Gray Terminal, forfeiting his noble heritage. Since a child becomes a full-fledged noble at the age of eighteen, Sabo intended to leave the Goa Kingdom at the age of seventeen, to escape the idea of being recognized as the thing he hated the most. He even refers to the nobles as \"smelling worse than Trash Mountain, as they are people rotten to the core\". At age 22, Sabo has retained much of his old personality, although he appears to have adapted many mannerisms from Luffy, including his brother's tendency to mispronounce the names of others. Moreover, his tendency to hang up the Den Den Mushi in the middle of a call rather annoys his comrades. He has also displayed an immensely fierce protective streak towards Luffy, to the point where he will disregard everything he is currently doing if he feels that Luffy is in any sort of danger, including his duties in the Revolutionary Army. This is largely contributed by Sabo's inability to save Ace from death before the timeskip, a fact that Sabo still regrets to this very day. This is ironic considering that Ace himself had gained a very similar protective-streak after Sabo's presumed death.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo has command over all lower ranking members, with only one direct superior, Supreme Commander Dragon, to answer to. His bounty of 602,000,000 proves that the World Government views him as an extremely dangerous threat. After the events of the Levely, Sabo is now known as the \"Flame Emperor\", with his reputation having skyrocketed to the point that he is now considered a legend, with his influence said to be even greater than that of his boss Dragon. Even when he had not yet eaten a Devil Fruit, he rose to the position of second-in-command and was able to take on Diamante, a top executive of the Donquixote Pirates, as well as Jesus Burgess, the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates' first ship and one of their strongest members, without any difficulty. After eating the Mera Mera no Mi, his power increased. He took on Admiral Fujitora and came out with only a few bruises, although Sabo suspected the Admiral was holding back. Later, Sabo faced Burgess again and defeated him very easily. According to Ace, who initially planned for Sabo to become his navigator, Sabo also has some experience in navigation. Sabo possesses great fighting skills. As a child (even before joining the Revolutionary Army), Sabo already exhibited high physical capabilities and hand-to-hand combat from the very intense training he endured in the harsh environment of Mt. Colubo. He and Ace together were able to topple Porchemy, a massive man, when the two of them arrived to save Luffy. Sabo was able to beat Luffy, despite Luffy already having the power of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, fifty times in one day. He was also able to beat Ace twenty-four times, although he lost to Ace twenty-six times. Sabo was good at thieving as well, since he and Ace were able to rob numerous people to get their money and valuables. He was fast enough to grab a knife from a pirate without the pirate being able to stop him. He also was exceptionally skilled in stealth and could jump out of a window several stories up without injuring himself. After joining the Revolutionary Army, Sabo was personally trained by Hack and Monkey D. Dragon and attained immense physical potential. Of all the child revolutionaries who were soldiers-in-training, only Sabo excelled in the Revolutionary Army's rigorous combat training regimen, and Hack said that he does not need to be trained. This is verified in the anime, when he faces the latter even as a child where he even surpassed him without any difficulty. As an adult, Sabo is shown to have extraordinary agility as he easily dodged an attack from a Fighting Fish, as well as tremendous physical strength, clashing with Jesus Burgess, a pirate known for his titanic strength, with little difficulty. He easily defeated Vice Admiral Bastille with a single grab that crushed his helmet and skull. He also exhibits strength in his legs, as he was able to take down Burgess with a single kick. Sabo's endurance is extraordinary, as he was able to survive a deep wound inflicted onto him by Imu while still escaping Pangaea Castle and reach Red Port without medical treatment. Sabo has impressive stealth skills, being able to move through Pangaea Castle and make it to the Empty Throne room. He was able to hide his presence from Imu and the Five Elders until he made his move, shocking them since none of them notice Sabo at all. After escaping Imu and the Five Elders, he was soon able to get out of Mary Geoise and stowaway on Lulusia Kingdom ship without getting detected, all while being badly injured. In his adulthood, Sabo has become a master of the Ryusoken fighting style, which revolves around the use of grips, which he refers to as \"claws\". His grips are strong enough to break armor, great swords, artillery, and even skulls with ease and remaining unharmed. He claims that his fingers are like the claws of a dragon. He also uses Haki to increase the strength of his fingers. In contrast to Luffy, who readily chooses to target his adversary, Sabo seems to prefer destroying his opponent's weapon first before going head-to-head against them. This difference in battle approach was what allowed Diamante to notice that Lucy was not actually Luffy when Sabo came to fight in Luffy's place in the coliseum. Sabo ate the Mera Mera no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into fire at will. He initially showed difficulty controlling his powers, which is typically displayed by new Devil Fruit users. He also mentions that he still has not grown fully accustomed to his new ability just yet, since he still has a habit of dodging attacks, despite now being a Logia-user. He has adapted to his new abilities quickly and has since undergone training and practice to master his powers. Sabo is able to utilize signature technique of his late sworn brother, Ace, the \"Hiken\", allowing him to transform his arm into a large, powerful fire blast. It is strong enough to shatter the bottom floor of the Corrida Colosseum, which was strong enough to support the weight of a giant, exposing the underground facilities. Sabo can also use his flames to augment his Ryusoken style, as well as imbue flames into his weapons. Sabo has shown great mastery in the usage of Busoshoku Haki, which he can imbue into his arm or his pipe. His mastery of this type of Haki is superior to that of Burgess, the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates' first ship, as he broke Burgess's Haki-infused right arm armor. Sabo also destroyed the Corrida Colosseum's fighting ring with his Haki-infused fists. Sabo possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. In the anime, he is highly skilled in the use of Kenbunshoku Haki, as he sensed that Luffy's Haki had become weak during the battle with Doflamingo, and he dodged multiple bullets that were fired at him. As a child, Sabo's preferred method of combat was stick fighting using metal pipes (as well as having slight traces of bo-staff styles). After the timeskip, he continues to use a similar metal pipe, effectively battling against and defending himself from attacks by opponents as strong as Diamante and Burgess. When used in conjunction with Busoshoku Haki, Sabo was able to easily break Diamante's weapon. After obtaining the Mera Mera no Mi, Sabo can ignite the two ends of his pipe."},

{"name": "Roronoa Zoro", "episode": "Episode 3", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "He was first mentioned by Alvida in Chapter 2.", "appearance": "Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent. Zoro's body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive scar stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired during his loss against the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr. 3's Tokudai Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through unknown means. Zoro's other remarkable feature is his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases him about by calling him \"marimo\" (moss-ball, moss-head in the VIZ manga and Funimation dub) due to its resemblance to one. Similar to most of his male crewmates, Zoro has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Before the timeskip, he would consistently wear black trousers tucked inside black boots, a plain white shirt with three undone buttons at the collar and his green haramaki. However, only Zoro's shirt varies from time to time in the arcs. During the Arlong Park Arc, he disembarked Sanji's fishing ship neglecting to put on a shirt. After beating up most of Arlong's crew, he wore an opened, navy-blue shirt decorated with light blue whirlpools that he stole from one of the fish-men. Since Zoro received his scar from Mihawk during the Baratie Arc before the Arlong Park Arc, Zoro wore bandages that were visible underneath his shirt. During the Loguetown Arc, Zoro acquired Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri to replace the two conventional katana which were broken by Mihawk in the Baratie Arc. During the Drum Island Arc, Zoro was bundled up for the winter island, but later stripped down after a foolish choice to swim in the frigid water on the island. He remained shirtless and shoeless in the beginning of the arc after getting lost from the Going Merry and left unable to redress himself, until he stole a parka from a man in Wapol's army, which was a hooded, forest green parka with a light green sash and white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem, as well as a pair of boots. During the Arabasta Arc, he wore an orange keffiyeh with a gold chain on his head, a long-sleeved white coat with black lines all over it, and the bottom of his black trousers were torn above his ankles. During the Skypiea Arc, he wore his usual outfit in the beginning of the arc until he took it off after fighting a sky shark to save Chopper from being eaten. Afterwards, he wore a long, deep blue tank top and goggles strapped either on his head or around his neck, which were later broken and discarded. During the Water 7 Arc, he wore his usual outfit until near the end, where he wore an unzipped, bright yellow jacket with a closed pocket flap on each side. He continued wearing this outfit throughout the Enies Lobby Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a black shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in white. At the end of the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an opened, gray shirt. He also replaced Yubashiri, which was rusted away by Shu in the Enies Lobby Arc, with Shusui, which was entrusted to him by the zombie of Ryuma brought to life by Brook's shadow. During the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, he wore an opened white shirt with red stripes. During his time at Kuraigana Island, shortly after being sent there by Bartholomew Kuma, he wore an opened, dark blue shirt. Since Zoro was critically injured when he arrived at the island, Perona patched him up, so bandages were all over his body. During and after the two-year timeskip, Zoro gains a new scar running down over his left eye, which is now implied to be critically injured, as it is always closed. His frame gets larger, showing considerably more muscle mass, and his hair has gotten shaggier, while slicked back. Zoro now wears a long, open dark-green coat closed on his waist that's held by a red sash, into which his three swords are tucked. His black bandanna is tied around his left forearm. His coat exposes his bare chest, revealing his green haramaki underneath the coat. He has also grown noticeably taller, as he is similar in height to Robin. During the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a white furry coat for protection against the cold weather on the COOL side of Punk Hazard, which he took from Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit. During the Dressrosa Arc, he wore a black suit and a white dress shirt with the top button undone. He also wore black sunglasses and a fake white mustache as a disguise. His sunglasses were destroyed in his clash with Admiral Fujitora. Additionally, he discarded the moustache upon his identity being exposed. After the battle against the Donquixote Pirates, Zoro took off his suit jacket and unbuttoned his shirt, leaving his chest and scar exposed. During the Zou Arc, Zoro wore a dark-blue T-shirt with his green coat and haramaki over a pair of long, black trousers and boots. During the Wano Country Arc, Zoro wore a white yukata with black details and a green cloud pattern on its bottom. He wore a dark green jittoku haori with a mon of a black sun over a khaki gear, and zri with a black strap. Zoro also styled his hair in the chonmage style. After agreeing to allow Shusui to return to Ryuma's grave and remain in Wano, Zoro was given the legendary blade Enma in exchange, which was entrusted to him by Kozuki Hiyori, the daughter of the sword's original owner, the legendary Samurai, Kozuki Oden. During the Raid on Onigashima, Zoro donned a black version of his normal coat and a new bright red sash. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates uniform created by Kin'emon, before he and Luffy were discovered by the enemy pirates. During the Egghead Arc, after reaching the control tower, Zoro changed into a dark full body jumpsuit with the SSG logo on the side of the left thigh, with a dark coat, gloves, and a belt across the upper body to hold his three swords on his back, along with a pair of DOM Shoes. In the Movie 2, after the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with his clothes inside, he had to wear a black kimono from a wedding store. Then he changes his clothes for an open black jacket, a white scarf, and black pants like the ones he normally wears. In the Movie 3, he wears an open blue jacket with short sleeves, with a white line on the sleeves, short black pants, and still wearing his green haramaki. Also momentarily, he wears an extravagant penguin costume designed by Usopp. In the Movie 6, he wears black pants, and a brown shirt, which he later exchanges for an open white jacket."},

He has a curly black mustache and a fluffy gray beard, and wears black shades, which were shattered when Usopp fell on him. Like all other World Nobles, Rosward wears a thick white suit with medal-like knobs and a bubble over his head to prevent himself from breathing the same air as the commoners. His suit included a thick white cape. He also wields a walking cane that is revealed to be a rifle. In Mary Geoise, he is seen carrying a mallet.", "personality": "Rosward is noted to be the most-responsible of his family yet seen; as seen when he scolded his children for their behavior. Though he scolds his children and appears concerned, he is merely maintaining the appearance of their power and acts in a misanthropic, elitist manner almost even more so than his children. Although he has \"never hit his son\", he was livid at Luffy after he assaulted Charlos, for having the gall to directly affront their position. Like his daughter Shalria, he has deep pride in his ancestry. He apparently has a \"Pirate Captain collection\" (which included Devil Dias and Jean Bart), and does nothing to stop or alter the treatment that his children give to others. Rosward has shown to be extremely cruel and brutal as he enjoyed torturingan enslaved Bartholomew Kuma while referring to the latter as a top class slave due to his inability to scream or cry. Like his children, his belief in his untouchable status as a World Noble seems to render him incapable of realizing the danger around him, even when completely obvious. Despite the fact that Luffy brutally punched his son Charlos across the room, Rosward's only reaction is anger, rather than fear of someone who could and would cause him serious harm if provoked, as if he were somehow incapable of being harmed himself. He shot pointlessly at Luffy several times with his cane-rifle until disarmed by Sanji, at which point he apparently realized that the Straw Hats would not be cowed into submission, instead calling for a Marine Admiral to deal with them. Regardless, he still took the threat head-on instead of acting out of cowardly self-preservation, although it's most likely due to his aforementioned belief in his untouchable nature. His pride in the Celestial Dragon heritage is that he despises any of his brethren for not honoring their bloodlines, such as those of the Donquixote Family, specifically Homing and Mjosgard.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a World Noble, Rosward has the authority to act as he pleases without fear of legal repercussion. He also possesses tremendous wealth, having bought a \"Pirate Captain Collection\" of slaves that his daughter can manhandle callously, and his son spending 500,000,000 on a mermaid. He has tremendous political influence, more so than any royalty of the Levely, and the power to summon an Admiral of the Marines in the event he feels his authority alone would not inflict submission. Due to being spoiled by his heritage, Rosward has no fighting skills whatsoever, as he could not hit a stationary Luffy with his firearm even at moderate range, and Sanji easily disarmed him. His endurance and durability was very low, as he was taken out when Usopp fell on top of him. He wields a gun built into his cane, but could not manage to hit Luffy from a mediocre distance, even though Luffy was stationary."},

His long, darkish hair was an unruly mass, with locks sticking out unevenly behind his head, in every direction. He had slanted eyes and seemingly tended to sport a wide, toothy smile. Rocks' main outfit appeared to have consisted of a high-collared sailor's coat with fringed epaulettes, plus a buttoned shoulder belt.", "personality": "Based on stories of his exploits, Rocks appeared to be an incredibly vicious and ambitious man, having no care as to who he attacked as long as he could garner power for himself and leading his crew to destroy whoever interfered with his ambitions. He was also quite fearless and indiscriminately ruthless, as he had no issue with killing World Nobles or their slaves if it suited his wishes. Rocks' dream was to become the King of the World (, Sekai no ?), and he attacked many locations and left mass destruction in his wake to assert his dominance. He was also very curious about subjects that the World Government had kept hidden, resulting in him dabbling in those subjects.", "abilities_and_powers": "Although Rocks' individual strength and abilities are unknown, he was well-reputed for presiding over a crew of extremely powerful pirates with clashing personalities and a lack of camaraderie, indicating that he was an extremely powerful and charismatic individual. Many of these people would go on to make big names for themselves after the crew's dissolution; \"Whitebeard\" Edward Newgate, \"Big Mom\" Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou \"King of the Beasts\" came to constitute three quarters of the original Four Emperors, widely regarded as the strongest pirate crews in the world during the Golden Age of Piracy. In his time, Xebec was considered to be the most formidable rival of the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, even more so than his then-subordinate Newgate would come to be. He was so fearsome, it took the efforts of both Roger and Monkey D. Garp working together to finally defeat him. Rocks defeat was also what caused Garp to become a legend and to be known as the \"Hero of the Marines\", showing how much of a threat the World Government considered him to be. Kaidou, who by the present has come to be called the \"Strongest Creature\", included Xebec when he listed a very small number of notable figures that were worthy to stand against him in battle, alongside Kozuki Oden, Shanks, Newgate, and Roger, further hinting at Xebec's might and threat. Aside from raw strength, Rocks seemed to be a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, as, through studying many subjects that were considered taboo, he was able to unravel many of the World Government's secrets, which led the Government to decide to erase his name from history following his defeat. Rocks is seen wielding a sword during the fight with Roger and Garp in God Valley."},

{"name": "Rob Lucci", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Rob Lucci is a tall and slim, yet muscular man with arched eyebrows and a close-shaved goatee. He has shoulder length wavy black hair that is sometimes tied in a ponytail. When he is not fighting, his pet pigeon Hattori is usually perched quietly on his right shoulder. He has a tattoo of a crossed-out square on each upper arm, as well as five cannonball scars on his back in the shape of the World Government symbol. He was noted to be good looking by some women from Water 7 and Gatherine. He wore a large black top hat with a sepia band until he lost it during his fight with Luffy. As a shipwright, he wore brown trousers with caramel suspenders over a white tank-top and shoes with black toecaps. As an assassin, he wore a two-piece black suit with the sleeves normally rolled up, complete with black leather shoes and a white tie and handkerchief in the breast pocket. When invading Iceburg's mansion he was wearing a bull mask and a light pink robe with thick sleeves and a yellow \"tie\" above. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Lucci is shown with the kanji for \"peace\" (, heiwa?) on his shirt, which possibly suggests that the branch Lucci is holding is an olive branch in tribute to the type of branch held by white doves (in this case Hattori) as a sign of peace. The anime had also portrayed Lucci as a teenager in its rendition of his past story. Though the two portrayals of Lucci are meant to be him, they have different styles to them, mostly because Oda's version was drawn after the anime had already depicted him and not just because they show him at two different ages. Note that Oda did depict the silhouette of thirteen-year-old Lucci from the backside, though only briefly - this most likely is where the anime design for him originates. In CP9's Independent Report, he wore a light spotted shirt with a black coat over his shoulders and had bandages over his forehead and chest from his fight with Luffy and let his hair fall freely. After the timeskip, he wears a blue-white suit with a white coat draped over his shoulders. His beard has also grown longer and has a small ball on the end. As a CP0 agent, he wears a simple mask that covers the top half of his face, with markings that curve beneath the eyes. In One Piece Film: Gold, he wears a little medal on the chest, during the Levely Arc, he wears a purple flower instead. During the Egghead Arc, he wears a medal with a slightly different design.", "personality": "Lucci comes off as a cold, distant, and collected Cipher Pol agent; almost completely sociopathic and amoral of everything around him. A testament to his cold-blooded nature is his brutal assault on his \"friend\" of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9's identities were revealed. He also stated that he felt no true bond with the city of Water 7 which he lived in for five years, and had no concern for his superior Spandam, though he is widely regarded amongst his CP9 colleagues despite his arrogance. During his long undercover period, Lucci remained silent all the time, using Hattori as his preferred method of communication. In spite of his unfriendly looks, shipwright Lucci was polite, humble and tended to call out his fellow shipwrights for questionable conduct, particularly Paulie. Once his mission was completed, Lucci completely abandoned this persona, reverting back to the cold killer attitude that is natural to CP9's agents. Lucci bases his outlook of justice on his personal philosophy that any person or thing that goes against the World Government's interests should be destroyed, but is also evil for being that way. Specifically, he has declared to enforce Absolute Justice in CP9s form of \"Dark Justice\" (, Yami no Seigi?), his motto being \"Necessary Evil\" (, Hitsuy Aku?). As such he is willing go to extreme lengths to fulfill his given mission by any means necessary, believing that CP9's authority to kill to be justified and are unobligated to follow Spandam's ideals as long as they complete their missions efficiently. He also finds it offensive when someone shows weakness around him, as seen when he told the cowardly Marines on a Buster Call ship to shut up, and went as far as to dismiss a new colleague by presumably killing him for being weak. The reason that he killed the five hundred soldiers in his past was due to another belief of his - the belief that weakness is a sin (although he didn't even give them a chance of redemption). Personally, he believes anyone who shows weakness is no better than a criminal. However, it appears that in spite of his stoic and professional appearance, Lucci is far from emotionless or beyond provocation. Beneath his expressionless demeanor, lies tremendous pride and arrogance along with extreme bloodthirst. In the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby, he revealed that he only joined the World Government so he could be legally allowed to kill people; a sentiment which dates back to his childhood. An example of Lucci's lust for violence is when he compromised the mission of bringing Robin to the Gates of Justice, by allowing Monkey D. Luffy to tail him for the sole purpose of having a battle, smirking when Luffy burst through the door. Lucci's violent and cruel nature is also shown when he goes into full-beast mode during battle, in order to attack Luffy more violently. Like his fellow assassin Jabra, Lucci is prone to licking his lips pre-battle, showing a very animalistic side. In and out of combat, Lucci is very sadistic and also seems to derive amusement and gratification from inflicting physical and emotional pain on others. These scenes, along with his anticipation of battle, are the only times where he feels genuinely happy. As an example of his sadism, Lucci once flooded an entire passageway tin an attempt to kill the Straw Hat crew members moving through it, simply because he wanted to eliminate Luffy's chances of having everything, just to anger him. Lucci has a habit of demoralizing and taunting his opponents, which is seen various times during his confrontation with Luffy, where he constantly brought up the possibility of killing Nico Robin. Lastly, while understated initially, it is very clear Lucci's title of the strongest in CP9's history has massively elevated his ego, leading to what appears to be a superiority complex. This pride also means he has a very low tolerance for insults. During his fight with Luffy, Lucci did not pay attention to Usopp until he started insulting him. In addition, he reacts rather violently to anyone calling him a gaki (slang in Japanese for \"kid\" or \"brat\"), responding with a kick and a retort both times after Iceburg and Franky referred to him as such. This is perhaps best exemplified by his reencounter with Luffy at Egghead, where Lucci was eager to fight him again while disregarding Kaku and Stussy's warnings that they needed permission from the World Government to do so due to Luffy's new status. Aside from Lucci's own personal vengeance towards Luffy for defeating him 2 years ago, Lucci cannot accept the fact that a \"mere pirate\" was able to defeat CP9's strongest and ignored all warnings and protocols just so he could battle Luffy one more time. Sometimes, Lucci's pride borders on unfitting childishness as, despite losing once more, he still stubbornly refused to acknowledge Luffy's power or his stature as an Emperor of the Sea despite the latter's victory against Kaidou. Despite all this apparent lack of morality, Lucci has displayed some, if very little, sympathy for those he dubs innocent. When the Candy Pirates were attacking a small village, he quickly dispatched the captain to save the people, though his demonstration of Absolute Justice later prompts him and his comrades to leave. This shows that deep down, he is not completely heartless and is more honorable to the people he respects. Likewise, he shows concern for his pet pigeon Hattori, sending him away when in dangerous situations. Lastly, he expressed gratitude to the doctor who saved his life after his clash with Luffy on Enies Lobby. After the timeskip, Lucci's personality has largely stayed the same, as he condoned Saint Charlos' attempts to claim Shirahoshi as a slave during the Levely. He maintains that the Celestial Dragons are divine and have the right to obtain what they want from normal humans. Still, he is one of the few government agents that is willing to question and delve into the ongoings of the institution, regardless of the dangers of doing so. Lucci also appears to be very honest when he is not under orders to maintain his cover. Even when his enemies had him in cuffs and his only hope of survival was to convince them to release him, he still answered all their questions truthfully without hesitation, even though his answers would have made them want to free him less. That said, this all turned out to be deception from his part, showing that Lucci can be patient and pragmatic in extremely unfavorable situations.", "abilities_and_powers": "As CP9's strongest member, Lucci has had his great power acknowledged even by Bartholomew Kuma of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, who noted that no one could have forseen Lucci's defeat. Even at the tender age of 13, Lucci was already known to be a very capable mass murderer, having killed 500 of a kingdom's soldiers as well as a pirate crew single-handedly. By adulthood, Rob Lucci had become by far the strongest agent in CP9 history, with his Doriki at 4000 (almost twice that of the second strongest agent, Kaku's 2200). Franky remarked that Lucci's strength was levels above the rest of CP9 and that, had it not been for Luffy holding him off with their fight, he was unsure how many of their comrades would have been slaughtered. Since his first known loss to Luffy, Lucci grew more powerful and is now officially part of CP0, which is considered to be the strongest and most exclusive of the Cipher Pols. He also appears to be in a position of authority within CP0, usually giving orders and instruction to other agents. However, he proved to be no match for Luffy after the young pirate become one of the Four Emperors. Because of his reputation, he is a very valuable asset to the World Government, almost to the point of legend. Vice Admiral Onigumo even believed that he could survive a Buster Call attack. Lucci is also a skilled ventriloquist, meaning he is capable of making his voice sound like it is coming from somewhere else, most notably from his pet pigeon Hattori. Having undergone extremely hard Rokushiki training from early childhood, Lucci has developed extraordinary physical prowess, well beyond any other CP9 agent; specifically, 400 times stronger than a common, armed soldier (eight times greater than the necessary minimum to be considered \"superhuman\") according to his Doriki, without transforming. Lucci possesses tremendous durability and reserves of stamina. Even after taking a considerable amount of damage from Luffy's Gear 2 attacks, Lucci barely flinched and resumed the battle after being slammed into two buildings by Luffy's Gigant Pistol, though he was almost knocked out and took heavy damage later. At only the age of 13, he came out untroubled, without showing any signs of pain after being shot at from behind by multiple cannon shots, only receiving the scars on his back. Strength-wise, he could temporarily knock out Franky, a powerful cyborg immune to bullets, with a single blow before sending him crashing through a wall with a kick. He could block Sanji's kick with his forearm without using Tekkai. As a user of Shigan, his fingers are extremely strong, allowing him to penetrate stone pavement with a simple grip. Lucci also easily caught Luffy's face with one arm, despite his own great strength, while at the same time shrugging off all his punches, and then casually threw him into a wall. During a brief confrontation against those who were trying to defend Shirahoshi from Charlos, Lucci was able to catch Leo, who is a very fast, small dwarf, and effortlessly push Sai, the leader of the Happo Navy, with a single kick. Lucci is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, as shown when he fought Luffy in their second match, before Luffy used Gear 2. Lucci fought an even battle with him without using his Devil Fruit powers, and was even slightly superior, as he got more hits on his opponent than the Straw Hat captain did to him. Furthermore, he barely used the more offensive techniques like Shigan and Rankyaku until Luffy started using his Gears. Along with his great superhuman prowess, Lucci is a highly intelligent and cunning individual, being able to become a master carpenter within a 5-year period merely as a form of espionage and surveillance over his \"boss\" Iceburg (whom CP9 believed to have possession of the blueprints for the Ancient Weapon Pluton), and even when it was discovered otherwise, Lucci quickly deduced the next most likely candidate (Franky) based solely on their adolescent friendship. He and the other CP9 agents that infiltrated Water 7 deceived every single inhabitant, a clear sign of their manipulative skills. A master tactician, Lucci managed to almost single-handedly eliminate the Straw Hat Pirates (excluding Luffy, whom he was battling) by understanding the structure of his environment and firing a well-aimed \"Rankyaku\" through a stone wall, flooding the ground floor of the Tower of Justice and all its hidden underground passages with seawater. Had it not been for the unexpected arrival of Kokoro and her mermaid heritage, they would not have survived. He also quickly analyzed the mechanics behind Luffy's Gear 2 technique after engaging it for just a couple of minutes at most, explaining it to the rubber-man and stating that such bodily pressure would shave years off his lifespan. The fact that he was able to reach the same level as the Galley La carpenters (who spend their whole life building their skills) in five years just to do an undercover job shows a great talent for it. As an experienced spy, Lucci is very effective at gathering information and sending it his superiors without arousing suspension. Admiral Kizaru praised Lucci for being a very capable agent after he sent the Marines all the information they needed to know during the Egghead Incident. Since Lucci worked as a shipwright during his mission on Water 7, this means that he has some carpentry skills and knowledge about ships. He worked as a sawyer, treenail, and bolt specialist. He, along with Kaku, was able to recognize that the Pluton blueprints Franky revealed on Enies Lobby were indeed real. Lucci has the greatest mastery of Rokushiki within CP9, having developed more powerful variations from each of the different forms. Being able to skillfully use Soru and Shigan against 500 soldiers, he fatally pierced their armor along with their bodies; he also used Tekkai to break two swords effortlessly. By adulthood, Lucci's extraordinary skill in Rokushiki, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, allowed him to use improved variations of the martial art, such as Rankyaku: Gaicho, which could cleave through the iron hull of a Marine battleship, and Tobu Shigan: Bachi, which could pierce Luffy's rubber body with mere flicks of compressed air. In his hybrid form, a simple Rankyaku was enough to slice through the Galley-La Headquarters and cause most of the building to collapse. His high skill in Tekkai allowed him to casually block an attack from Roronora Zoro, a swordsman that can easily slice steel. Indeed, Franky's Strong Hammer, which sent his fellow CP9 agent Fukurou flying through two walls, despite his use of Tekkai, failed to make Lucci budge an inch, as the assassin's Doriki was five times his. Most notably, he used a hidden, seventh Rokushiki technique, Rokuogan, during his fight with Luffy. The massively powerful technique was so strong that it caused severe internal injury to Luffy's body, who described its effect as an Impact Dial with greatly amplified power, which is no small feat, considering that he is made of rubber. With his complete mastery of Rokushiki, in conjunction with his Devil Fruit ability, Lucci proved to be a tremendously resilient and formidable foe, fighting on equal footing with Luffy in Gear 2, even being slightly superior, forcing Luffy to use Gear 3 to weaken him and in the end use all his forces against him. It has been revealed that Lucci can perform Seimei Kikan, like Kumadori, and use it to alter his body into forms that amplify his skills in a specific Rokushiki ability. However, only the Kami-e Form, which makes his man-beast form smaller and thinner, more like an average man-size, has been seen. Lucci ate the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit which allows him to transform into a full leopard, or a bulky leopard-human hybrid at will. As Zoan class Devil Fruits enhance physical capabilities the most, it is most favored by martial artists like Lucci, who is able to integrate the unique traits of his Devil Fruit, such as claws and stronger legs, to greatly enhance the effects of his techniques. Also, being a carnivorous animal, Lucci is more bloodthirsty and predatory than a regular Zoan class user, proven when he mauled Luffy as an actual leopard. By using Seimei Kikan, Lucci can transform his bulky hybrid body into a more slender form. This smaller body greatly increases his speed, but at the cost of decreasing his Zoan enhanced strength. Lucci has also achieved Devil Fruit Awakening, letting him assume a new, much more powerful hybrid form, which greatly enhances his physical strength, speed, as well as his recovery rate. Unlike most Awakened Zoans, Lucci's personality was not overtaken by the animal nature of the Devil Fruit. In this awakened form, he could somewhat match Luffy, while in his own Awakened form for a time, even meeting him in a fist clash and withstanding his Gomu Gomu no Mogura Pistol; however, he was soon overpowered as he started putting more force behind his attacks. Lucci possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. In his rematch against Luffy after the timeskip, while \"Awakened\", Lucci hardened his fists and clashed with him, a powerful Busoshoku Haki master in his own right. His hardened claws bypassed Sentomaru's advanced-grade defensive Busoshoku Haki. Non-canonically, he was also seen hardening his arm, while fighting Sabo in One Piece Film: Gold. Lucci possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

In his disguise as Ricky, he wears a dark purple (blue in the anime) cape with a skull and crossbones on the back, a black pair of briefs covered by a leather pteruges skirt, a leather chest harness, and a gold (silver in the anime) masked helmet which covers his entire face save for his eyes and features a prominent nose-guard; it also features a flame-like design on it. A crack in this helmet received during his fights in the B Block battle royale revealed that he has a thick brown mustache and beard. Doldo later revealed his identity in the dungeon beneath the Colosseum and is shown to have a beard, mustache and thick eyebrows. A spiky ring of hair goes around the back of his head and he has a single large tuft of hair near his crown. A stitched scar runs from right above his left eyebrow to the top of his head. It was the result of a head injury he received when he first met Kyros.At some point, he received a second scar across the right side of his upper chest and lower neck. While he was king of Dressrosa, he had all his hair, which was still dark colored around the temples. His facial hair and eyebrows also shared the same color. Riku's attire was, at that point, usually covered by a royal mantle.", "personality": "Although the modern public used to revile his name, Doldo, in truth, is an extremely kind, noble, and caring man. When he was king, he cared immensely for his people, as he put the welfare of Dressrosa's citizens first and readily helped countries that were in need. This earned him great respect from monarchs of other countries such as Elizabello II. Upholding the Riku family ancestors' ideas of compassion and pacifism, he desires peace, as he agreed to pay Doflamingo's ransom instead of declaring war against him. He even went as far as bowing down to the citizens, despite his advisers saying it would shame him, showing that he was willing to go beyond a royalty's ethics. However, he recognized that his pacifist ways caused him to be a weak ruler as it consequently resulted in the immense suffering of countless Dressrosa citizens and the death of his own daughter Scarlett. Thus, Doldo had no intentions of ever returning to the throne. After Doflamingo's downfall, however, the people of Dressrosa unanimously elected him to be their king again, wanting peace above all else. Doldo is also a very proud man. He refused to have his injuries tended to after his defeat in B Block, although he was also trying to hide his identity, and did not want it exposed, especially in front of his granddaughter.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king of Dressrosa, he had the complete authority over the country and its resources.

During the battle royale, he as 'Ricky' was seen vastly surpassing the other gladiators in B Block in terms of speed, similar to Rokushiki's Soru technique. He has extraordinary stamina and recovery rate, as he got up quickly after taking a kick to the face from Blue Gilly and then took the King Punch from Elizabello II (although he fainted briefly from this), where he later recovered without receiving any medical treatment.. He was trained by Kyros. His swordsmanship was so great that several gladiators speculated that he was fromWano Country. When he was younger, he was shown to be strong enough to inflict a minuscule scratch (but permanent scar) on Kyros, a feat no other gladiator could accomplish, though Kyros, when he recognized him, held back.Although he himself claims to have weakened over time, he managed to incapacitate some contestants with one swing of his blunt sword. In the anime, he dual wielded two wooden staffs as improvised swords, able to fend off multiple pirates who were attacking the citizens for Usopp's bounty.[citation needed] Unlike the other gladiators trained at the Colosseum, Doldo does not fight using a shield but instead fights with an old and blunted sword using both hands.

His eyes are usually white when he is in a comical or friendly mood, but red when he is in a vicious or enraged mood. He has golden brown fur and a pink mane in the manga. In the anime, his fur is green and his mane is purple. After the timeskip, he has gotten fatter, and wears a one-piece garment with white and orange rhombuses, and a white frill collar.", "personality": "Despite his size and fierce look, Richie mostly acts like a kitten, having his own goofy moments when doing nothing. Richie is intelligent enough to adopt human-like mannerisms, but is otherwise not very bright and most of the time thinks only about food.Sometimes, his own crewmates will mistake his melodramatic longings for food as though he felt moved by a sad or touching moment if such has just taken place.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a large lion, Richie can fight by biting and mauling his victims. He is fairly strong, having enough biting force to destroy a thick iron cage that not even Roronoa Zoro thought he could cut down and being capable of knocking Monkey D. Luffy away through a wooden building with a single swipe of his paw."},
{"name": "Rebecca", "episode": "Episode 704", "chapter": "Chapter 633", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Rebecca is a fair-skinned and thin teenager who is of average height but slightly shorter than Luffy. She has long, light pink hair, which she wears in a braid. She holds a strong resemblance to her mother. As a gladiator, she wore a yellow scale armor bikini, with a turquoise paludamentum, as well as a ridge helmet, a pair of greaves and gloves, ahigh-heeled armor, and a necklace. The helmet got damaged during Hakuba's assault and was missing the visor's middle piece in the second round. It was completely shattered after Diamante bashed her over the head with a club. She carried a large sword and shield. She discarded the shield before entering the D Block battle royale. She is considered extremely attractive and beautifulby the other gladiators. When a fan asked whether Rebecca wears underwear underneath her gladiator loincloth, Oda answered that he had an idea, but refused to give an actual answer. Underneath her helmet, her braid splits off into two strands starting at her temples. Before the Corrida Colosseum tournament started, she wore a short and simple white dress, a yellow pearl necklace and brown sandals. After Donquixote Doflamingo was defeated and she briefly regained her status as a princess, she was seen wearing a light-colored dress with frills at the bottom, almost identical to the one her mother wore. Rebecca also wore a ribbon which was tied at the top of her long braided light pink hair. When she was a child, her hair was shorter, yet she had the braided ponytail. She wore a light blue hooded coat. However, the manga portrayed her coat as dark-colored.", "personality": "Rebecca is a calm and proud warrior who harbors a deep resentment towards Donquixote Doflamingo and wishes to obtain the Mera Mera no Mi to hunt him down and kill him. Furthermore, even though she pretends to shrug off others mocking her about Spartan, she is actually really bothered by it to the point of biting her bottom lip. She appears to have some knowledge of the Colosseum's history and was kind enough to enlighten Lucy upon noticing his interest in the giant statue of Kyros. She is very respectful of others as she tried to get Ricky to heal up after his fight, thanked Luffy for taking down Spartan, and later paid for the food he takes. Although a brave warrior, she can be extremely emotional at times as shown when she did shed some tears as she saw Thunder Soldier. She also expressed other forms of weakness such as the biting of her bottom lip when she was mocked by other gladiators. She dislikes expressing weakness to others as she claims she does not get hungry while remembering the time she told her mom she was during her childhood which inadvertently cause her mother's death. In order to achieve her goal of protecting those dear to her, she was willing to resort to underhanded tactics, such as the attempted assassination of Luffy, although ultimately failing as a result of a lack in killing intent or immoral nature. After her failed assassination attempt, she was prepared to face retaliation, showing that she is not a coward. Rebecca is extremely kind, having been taught by her mother not to hurt people. As such, she strictly fights in a way that avoids injuring her opponents directly during the time when she was a convicted gladiator despite the violent and brutal matches of the Corrida Colosseum. Kyros proudly praised Rebecca for inheriting Scarlett's kindness during his battle with Diamante. She is sociable and can be quick to engage in friendly conversations especially with those who are acquainted with Luffy.", "abilities_and_powers": "As she wanted to eat the Mera Mera no Mi, it indicates that she is not a Devil Fruit user. She is known throughout the colosseum as the \"Undefeated Woman\", implying that she has never lost a fight yet, but at the same time, she was shownto bebullied by other gladiators such asSpartan. Since she was a child, Rebecca has been trained to fight by Kyros (as Thunder Soldier) who was the best fighter of Dressrosa colosseum, although he was limited by his body as a one-legged toy. Due to the combat training regimen under Thunder Soldier since childhood, Rebecca is incredibly agile. Rebecca's greatest ability lie in her tremendous speed and ability to rapidly avoid attacks. As a testament of her power, while the other gladiator convicts were badly injured to the point of missing arms and legs, Rebecca does not have a scratch on her. She seems to be almost unbeatable in speed, as the gladiators were shocked when Luffy escaped from her slash. Being immensely evasive, Rebecca can avoid assaults from multiple enemies at once. Her most impressive display was dodging, albeit barely blocking, Hakuba's attack that hit 20 people in an instant.Rebecca also has some level of strength, as the force she applies in her swordsmanship allowed her to parry off or defend against powerful strikes from gladiators, including enemies who are physically larger than herself. Rebecca was also shown to use proficient kicks or grappling throws to push enemies out of the ring in conjunction with her sword. Rebecca is shown to be skilled with a sword. She uses a style of swordsmanship dubbed the \"Backwater Sword Dance\" (, Haisui no Kenbu?), or the Back-to-the-Water Dance in the Viz manga and FUNimation adaptations, which is completely defensive in nature. It emphasizes on using her sword to exploit her opponents' strength and momentum rather than using personal brute force to defeat them, reminiscent of real world aikido. She wins her battles in the Colosseum by having her opponents fall out of the ring without directly injuring them. This is how she earned the title of \"Undefeated Woman\".Her style of combat is a reflection of her personality of not wanting to hurt others, and has allowed her to survive and defeat all her opponents in the colosseum without directly harming anyone. Suiting her defensive nature, Rebecca can expertly use her sword to defend and parry off attacks from physically strong and powerful enemies. Her fighting style however proves to be ineffective against stronger and more experienced combatants, and she was rendered helpless when facing an opponent as strong as Diamante. Rebecca wields a medieval style long sword, which from the ground up almost reaches her shoulders. However, presumably in an effort not to directly harm or kill anyone, the blade is blunt. She also has a rounded shield, which she carries on her left arm. As a gladiator of Corrida Colosseum, she has received training in wielding both sword and shield during combat. However, she discarded the shield before the D block battle royale. Rebecca has been shown to be extremely capable at avoiding attacks, and Luffy worked out that she must be using Kenbunshoku Haki.Having been extensively trained by Kyros to hone her inner instinct to perfection, she appears to possess a great degree of mastery over her Kenbunshoku Haki, combined with her speed and reflexes has allowed her to emerge unscathed in all her earlier colosseum battles, thus earning her the title as the 'Undefeated Woman'. More significantly, she was able to see through Hakuba's movements despite his extremely blinding speed, and managed to barely survive his attack that took out everyone else."},

{"name": "Raizo", "episode": "Episode 817", "chapter": "Chapter 768", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was first mentioned by Kanjuro in Chapter 803.", "appearance": "Raizo is a very large man, standing at 311cm (10ft). He is also quite disproportionately wide, with his head being nearly the same width as the rest of his body. He has exceptionally pronounced cheekbones and a long, square jaw with rounded teeth. He also has thick and lightning-shaped black eyebrows as well as a crescent moon-shaped scar on his forehead that was given to him by King. He has been noted to look rather older and ugly, with no woman being attracted to him, and the prisoners in Udon were not sure he had time traveled as they could easily believe he had aged 20 years since the last time they saw him. Raizo possesses short black hair that includes a small spike at the top of his head; the hair is also partitioned into six tendrils on the sides shaped like antennae. He bears the Kozuki Family crest somewhere on his body. For clothing, Raizo wears a light blue kimono whose inner edges are lined by orange stripes dotted with dark blue polka dots. He also wears a green obi tied in a bowtie around his waist, a dark yellow-scaled undershirt and pants under his kimono, a purple nio-dasuki on his back, and a pair of sandals on his feet. He also wears two diamond-shaped appendages on his back whose colors alternate between light and dark blue; this apparatus appears to function as a kite. In the past one to two decades of his life, Raizo was much smaller and his six hair appendages were shorter and shaped more like spikes.", "personality": "Raizo is a serious, honorable, and kindhearted man who cares greatly about his comrades and the people he serves. He will work tirelessly to aid his group's objectives and has no issue with risking his life; on the flip side, he absolutely hates the idea of people risking their lives to protect him. This was shown on Zou when he was devastated to see the Mokomo Dukedom residents injured protecting him from Jack, and said he would rather they turn him in rather than continue facing danger. Raizo has a tendency to become very emotional when overcome by strong feelings, both good and bad, and will often bawl heavily. He will not hesitate to show people just how much he cares about or is grateful for them. Raizo cares greatly about the samurai code of loyalty, and although he detests Kurozumi Orochi, he did commend his rival ninja Fukurokuju for remaining loyal to the shogun. Raizo has demonstrated himself to be quite diligent and prepared, a necessity for his profession. During the preparation period for the assault on Onigashima, Raizo was effective in formulating and executing strategies to increase the alliance's numbers, and also kept tabs on potential unresolved issues such as a lack of weapons to arm their allies with. He is not rash and will wait for the most opportune time to execute his plans, even if it takes several days. The only time Raizo was shown lapsing in his attentiveness while infiltrating enemy territory was when he reunited with his old comrade Kawamatsu in the Prisoner Mine, which resulted in him being spotted by the Beasts Pirates when the cart he was hiding behind moved. Even in emotional moments Raizo does not lapse in his judgement, as when Oden seemingly appeared before them in the present day, Raizo was one of the few Scabbards to doubt it was actually him, using logic to explain his doubt even though he wished that Oden was indeed still alive. Raizo takes his profession seriously and does not like to showcase his skills just for performance. However, he eventually relented with the Straw Hat Pirates when he saw them sullen after his refusal. Despite claiming to not partake in such an activity, Raizo has been shown adopting the stereotypical ninja verbal tic \"nin-nin\" when caught up in thrilling action during ninja duties. He has also been shown referring to simple actions like hugs as ninjutsu techniques. Raizo wishes to have a romantic relationship with a kunoichi, and his inability to attract women is something he is very self-conscious and depressed about. When he was younger, a rejection by a kunoichi drove him to leave the service of the Kozuki Oniwabanshu and live in despair as a vagabond in Udon for some time. Over a decade later, he was shown bemoaning his master Oden finding a wife while he had no such luck.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his massive size, Raizo is capable of carrying normal-sized humans on his head and shoulders with no issue. Despite his size, he is extremely fast, being capable of leaping off the walls of the Executive Tower in Udon too rapidly for any of the guards to keep up with. Additionally, he is fast enough to be able to hide with only the assistance of a smoke ball, even in large, crowded spaces. He has enough endurance to after recovering in a short time from battling Kaidou, Raizo was able to function normally. He also outlast Fukurokuju when they were both on fire despite being lit up first. Raizo is a tremendously skilled and accomplished ninja, being masterful in the techniques of ninjutsu. He was reputed as a \"genius\" ninja even when he was part of the Kozuki Oniwabanshu in his youth, and is stated to be the rival of Fukurokuju, the most recent captain of the Oniwabanshu. Despite his massive size, he is immensely talented at stealth and was able to infiltrate the heavily-guarded Prisoner Mine for several days while remaining unspotted for almost the entire time. Raizo is capable of gliding using the kite-like apparatus on his back. Raizo ate the Maki Maki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and manipulate scrolls. He can make the scrolls grow to massive size and unroll as long as he pleases. Raizo also has the ability to seal and store objects inside them and later release them. He can use his scrolls as a shield which can absorb and store his enemies attacks. He can then release the sealed attacks from the scroll back in the direction of his enemy to deal them damage from their own offense. He can take this utilization a step further by wrapping the scroll around his opponent's body and release the sealed attack at pointblank range from all around them. Since Raizo is unaware of Devil Fruits, like many residents of Wano he refers to this power as Maki Maki no Jutsu (?). Raizo's primary weapons are shuriken, which he is capable of throwing rapidly with excellent precision. He can throw dozens of shuriken in quick succession to strike hordes of enemies, and he is accurate enough to perform parlor tricks with them by throwing them into surfaces in the shape of something like kanji. During the raid on Onigashima, he wielded two swords which he used during the ambush of Kaidou. Raizo is a master of Busoshoku Haki, which is known as Ryuo in Wano. He can harden his swords and possesses an advanced level of Busoshoku Haki, as shown when he cuts through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin. Kikunojo possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Pythagoras", "episode": "Episode 1065", "chapter": "Chapter ", "year": 2022, "note": "Its name was first seen on a chart in Chapter 1062.", "appearance": "Pythagoras was a large mechanical being. His head was a sphere with a turn-key protruding from the top and a space in the front containing his eyes which always appeared drowsy; his head could detach from the main body and move independently with a set of retractable arms and legs. Pythagoras' main body was metallic, with the top part being dark-colored and the bottom light-colored. His designation, Punk-04, was printed on his left breast and the kanji for \"wisdom\" (?) was printed on the center of its chest. His arms, hands, and legs were composed of bendable metal rods.", "personality": "Being Vegapunk's \"wisdom\" satellite, Pythagoras has shown to be calm and highly interested in observing the performances of Vegapunk's inventions. It is devoted to recording data from these tests and examining the potential scientific implications, and can grow very excited when situations arise that provide exceptional data. It also tends to resort to peaceful solutions, as it was trying to reason with the CP0 agents that were sent to kill Vegapunk and his satellites, trying to create excuses for them not to land on Egghead. It even advised Lilith not to make things worse when she got angry at their repeated requests for permission to dock, knowing impulsive reactions could lead to them just coming to the island anyway.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a satellite of Vegapunk, Pythagoras has been a contributor to the genius scientist's numerous technological developments. Pythagoras is extremely intelligent, being capable of drawing a large number of theories and conclusions just by witnessing Vegapunk's inventions in action; when observing one of the Seraphim in combat, Pythagoras quickly made observations regarding potential Lineage Factor traits. It also seems to be part of Pythagoras' duties to compile and analyze data."},
{"name": "Queen", "episode": "Episode 925", "chapter": "Chapter 918", "year": 2018, "note": "He first appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 920.", "appearance": "Queen is a massive, round-figured man (evidently obese but claiming otherwise) with light skin. At a towering 612cm tall, he is a mere centimeter shorter than his fellow All-Star King. Similar to Jack, Queen is built top-heavy, with thick, tapering arms yet, compared to his upper self, smallish legs. After being drained of his fluids by Ryokugyu, he became much skinnier. His head is hunched, undistinguished from his neck due to its plumpness, with a small face. His eyes are hidden by sunglasses with blue lenses and gray, oval rims, which instead of having temples are strapped on by black tapes that go around his head in such a way as to form an X both on his forehead and occiput. Queen has no visible eyebrows, a small hook nose, and his small mouth, sporting navy lipstick, always smokes a big cigar. His hair is blond: a thick, queue-like braid through eight ties, with a stinger-shaped ending tuft, comes out the back of his head, which is otherwise bald. Additionally, he dons a Fu Manchu mustache whose tendrils widen as they droop to his chest. A stitched scar runs curvilinear from his right chest up to the shoulder. On Queen's upper right arm is a black (dark blue in the anime) tattoo consisting of his crew's Jolly Roger above his name in block capitals. Queen's left arm, up to the shoulder, is cybernetic in gray and golden color, composed of metallic rings, bolted plating, wiring, and even a small pressure gauge, with the corresponding hand covered in an orange glove, but was later destroyed by Sanji during the Raid on Onigashima. Queen wears large, very high-waisted overalls that uniformly reach just below the chest, are thickly, vertically striped black-and-white, and held up by suspenders connecting with 8-shaped, golden clasps on the frontal top edge; a piece of cloth striped the same is integrated into his metal arm. As for footwear, Queen has simple, brown ankle boots. As a child, he was chubby and shaved his hair to a buzzcut. He wore dark overalls and a pair of goggles on his forehead. During his time in MADS over 20 years ago, he was thin and had no facial hair. His hair was seemingly dyed, and styled in a mohawk-like hairstyle. He had sunglasses and multi-part earrings. He wore a light short-sleeved shirt which he kept open, trousers with vertical stripes, a belt, and dark gloves. Over time, he put on more and more weight, grew out his moustache, started braiding his hair into a queue, and mechanized his left arm. 20 years ago, he had a shorter, pencil-style mustache.", "personality": "Living up to his position as an All-Star, Queen prides himself as being a lively entertainer amongst the crew, including performing his signature funky songs and dances to rally his subordinates. Being extremely dramatic, he tends to treat his position as his own personal show, as seen when he told Babanuki to make an official ranking of the current issues at Udon. He can also be rather vain while performing, as he proudly proclaimed his fat as mere muscle and how he would be much more attractive if he was not voluntarily this large. At the time of being assaulted by Ryokugyu, he protested the loss of his corporal volume. Queen is also extremely arrogant with immense pride in himself and his crew as he considered the Beasts Pirates to be the strongest and the Pleasure and Waiter members of his crew to be useless dead weight due to their lack of artificial Zoan Devil Fruit powers making them incapable of being actual use to the crew itself. He also despises people who criticizes him and his actions such as his fellow All Star King due to his ego as an All Star of the Beasts Pirates, as he took twisted pride in using his viruses to hurt people including his own subordinates. Queen also considered Chopper's actions of saving infected members of the Beasts Pirates to be unnecessary, and even tried to kill Chopper out of annoyance for lecturing him with his medical ethics. Queen is extremely sadistic with an obsessive penchant for blood sports and execution games as a form of entertainment for himself and his crew, believing that the time it takes for a battle to conclude combined with the number of fighters is what determines the level of excitement in combat. To this end, Queen is fair to some extent, allowing Luffy to fight in the Great Sumo Inferno without being restricted by the Seastone cuffs. However, his execution games are nevertheless intended to be inescapable and unwinnable. He is also willing to add sadistic rules such as keeping Kid and Kamazo submerged in water until Luffy and Hyogoro die in the ring. He also has no qualms toying with the lives of his subordinates such as the Pleasures and Waiters for his own enjoyment. Despite having an inflated ego, Queen has a habit of losing his composure in light of an urgent situation. This was seen on Onigashima, when the Nine Red Scabbards suddenly showed up on the Live Stage to attack Kaidou, with a shocked Queen wondering where they came from. He is also shown not to be fearless as he was terrified upon seeing the change in Big Mom once she regained her memory. After Big Mom abruptly fell asleep, Queen took extreme precautions to restrain the sleeping Emperor and escort her to Onigashima as quickly as possible. However, this caused him to overlook the fact that Luffy was free of his collar and of the threat he now represented to Udon. His cowardice is evident during Kaidou's brawl with Big Mom, when Queen told his subordinates not to cower only for them to accuse him of making excuses to leave Onigashima. Like King, Queen is extremely rude and critical of his crewmates, as he was quick to deride his fellow All-Stars and call them names. He and King seem to have a mutual sense of disdain for Jack, as they are quick to gang up on him when in the same room. He also used derogatory language when addressing his subordinates in Prisoner Mine. According to Daifugo, Queen's hobbies are building weapons and viruses. As a scientist, Queen is extremely proud of his scientific talents, as he flaunts his personal cybernetic modifications, which he claims to be superior to Vegapunk's, in battle. He also enjoys proving his scientific superiority, as he demanded that Sanji use his Raid Suit against him to allow him to compete his own technology against Germa's. Queen also has a fondness for beautiful women, as he was seen ogling a picture of Komurasaki, and he appears to frequent the Red-Light District for prostitutes. His subordinates believed that he would go berserk and take his anger out on them if he found out that Komurasaki was dead. Queen is a glutton who is extremely fond of oshiruko, claiming it is just as important to him as the air he breathes. He is adamant in his refusal to share with anyone. When Queen does not get his daily fill of oshiruko, he becomes easily irritable and even murderous. Queen's love for oshiruko is so immense, that he is willing to fight the Emperor Big Mom to prevent her from stealing his oshiruko. Queen has interjected the word \"Excite\" (, Ekisaito?) into his sentences. The Japanese word for his epithet, \"Plague\", is \"Ekisai\" (?). The Viz translation retains the pun, with Queen saying phrases like \"I'm plagued with excitement!\". Like many other characters, Queen has his own distinct laugh, \"Muhahaha\" (, Muhahaha?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates, Queen has great authority over his crew just below his Governor-General. He formerly had the highest authority over Udon, a region in Wano Country, and oversaw proceedings at the Prisoner Mine, where all the Shinuchi who maintained the facility reported directly to him. In terms of battle prowess, Queen is one of the Beasts Pirates' strongest warriors, implied to be the strongest after Kaidou and King, holding a bounty of 1,320,000,000 that illustrates his fearsome reputation. Queen is a veteran pirate, having been part of the Beasts Pirates for at least 20 years and was already considered among its strongest members even then. Like the other All-Stars, he is hailed as a \"calamity\" for his destructiveness, having earned the moniker of \"The Plague\" due to his use of extremely potent manufactured viruses. In fact, had it not been for the efforts of Tony Tony Chopper, the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates, the thousands of warriors fighting on the Live Floor of the Skull Dome would have all been wiped out after being infected by just one of his artificial viruses. In the midst of combat, Queen exhibits extraordinary fighting skills, as he (alongside King), was able to battle Marco the Phoenix, the former right hand of the Emperor Whitebeard, until the latter's exhaustion, and emerged from the fight with superficial injuries, before engaging a large group of enemies. As a further testament to his power, Chopper, in his strongest form, the Monster Point, was utterly helpless before Queen, being quickly overwhelmed when the All-Star decided to take the fight seriously, and being unable to inflict any substantial damage on him during a time span of at least twenty minutes. Queen has demonstrated incredible fighting skills by combining his vast physical strength with his cybernetics, being capable of easily blocking one of Luffy's punches with his hand and throwing the pirate to the ground with his mechanical arm. He could fight and overwhelm Sanji, an extremely powerful martial arts master, slamming him through multiple reinforced stone walls with a single hand. However, Queen's fighting prowess has limits, as he was completely unable to track Sanji's newly acquired high speed movement after his genetic enhancements were fully awakened, which he initially mistook for invisibility, and was quickly defeated by his barrage of Ifrit Jambe-enhanced techniques. He is also shown to have enough durance to somehow survive the fall when Sanji kicked him out of Onigashima while it was being lifted into the sky. Queen is an extremely talented scientist, inventor, and mechanic who specializes in the creation of biological weaponry, perfecting these skills to the point of creating numerous man-made viruses, and designing and modifying himself with advanced enough cybernetics to replicate the Vinsmoke Family's abilities as Modified Humans, even developing modifications and weaponry for his Zoan form as well. Queen is also skilled at developing brutal torture machines and uses them as a method to break the spirits of the Beasts Pirates' enemies and get them to reveal information, an ability of which he is very proud of. Queen is notable for having been formerly part of MADS, a rogue research team involved in several scientific discoveries and development of weapons. Queen employs several cybernetic augmentations of his body that greatly assist him in battle. He claims to be a cyborg (, saibgu?, literally meaning \"mechanical human\") so technologically advanced that even Vegapunk, the world's greatest scientific genius and Queen's ex-colleague, would not be able to replicate him. Queen has multiple high-tech weapons and mechanisms installed within his body, which he usually activates while employing his Zoan abilities. Among his enhancements are laser beams, metal grappling claws, rocket launchers and extendable mechanized limbs. In his full brachiosaurus form, he has a double-barreled Gatling gun, artificial fangs and a laser beam cannon equipped at the end of his brachiosaurus tail and hair braid, as well as inside of his mouth, with the latter in particular being an extremely advanced form of technology that has only been replicated by master engineers like Franky and Vegapunk, a testament to Queen's own genius. Moreover, his neck area is modified with an in-built mechanical cable that allows him to extend his already long brachiosaurus neck beyond its normal range. He also has retractable needles in his teeth and voice activated rocket launchers in his sides. Queen's hybrid form displays a different set of modifications, such as clawed tentacle appendages located on his tail and braided hair, which is also capable of firing lasers. His prosthetic left arm also changes shape, sporting a claw similar to the aforementioned appendages. His left arm was later destroyed by Sanji during the Raid on Onigashima. Notably, Queen has done significant research on Germa 66's technology, with the intent of surpassing it through his own cybernetic replications. As such, Queen has access to most of the special powers held by the Vinsmoke siblings in their Raid Suits, such as Ichiji's optic beams, Niji's lighting shocks, Sanji's invisibility, and Yonji's extendable metal arm. Befitting his epithet of \"The Plague\", Queen is a genius virologist. He has invented abnormal and deadly viruses and weaponized them through ammunition known as Excite Bullets, which instantly spread the disease upon striking their victims. Two of Queen's viruses have been seen so far, and both of them are able to easily spread through physical contact, meaning Queen and anyone with Excite Bullets can quickly infect an entire closed-off group of enemies with only a few hits. He has shown sufficient medical expertise to develop an antidote for one of his deadliest viruses as a safety measure. Queen ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Brachiosaurus, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full brachiosaurus and a human-brachiosaurus hybrid at will. When fully transformed, Queen becomes much bigger and towers over even large humans like Big Mom, who stands over 8 meters tall. As a Zoan, he gains a significant boost to his physical abilities, and as an Ancient Zoan, this attribute is magnified several times over due to the immense toughness of his dinosaur hide. He has tremendous durability in this state, as he has been able to shrug off powerful attacks, including: Diable Jambe-enhanced kicks from Sanji, strikes from Chopper in Monster Point, Perospero's candy arrows, his own rocket launchers misfiring on him twice, and he was even able to quickly recover after taking two hits from the Emperor Big Mom, one of the most powerful combatants in the world. He can use the signature long neck of a brachiosaurus in combat, such as by swinging his head at his opponents, or using his long neck to reach targets that are further than he can normally reach or in mid-air, a skill that can be enhanced due to his extendable, cybernetic neck. Additionally, his body weight is drastically increased in his dinosaur form, and he can use this immense weight to his advantage, as very little will be able to withstand the crushing pressure of his massive, transformed body. In his Human-Beast Form, Queen generally favours the usage of his cybernetic enchantments and swordsmanship, but fully employs the power and weight of his extremely dense dinosaur body in his Beast Form. In Beast Form, Queen also possesses the abnormal ability to detach his neck and tail from his torso, effectively allowing him to transform into a large snake with a powerful coil that he claims can even crush the bones and innards of Busoshoku Haki masters. Queen is able to utilize both basic Haki-types. However, he rarely uses either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit ability and cyborg modifications. Queen is capable of using Busoshoku Haki to harden his arm in order to defend against attacks. Queen possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Queen carries two dao swords on his hips, which are proportionate to his body but rival the size of normal people. He was first shown using one of them to strike X Drake. One of them was shattered by Sanji when Queen attempted to strike him. The anime has him demonstrate enough skill wielding both blades to completely nullify Marco's Bluebird attack as well. Twenty years ago during the battle against Oden and the Nine Red Scabbards, Queen used a torch as a club. At Onigashima, Queen used a Gatling gun to attack the rebels of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance. The gun is loaded with Excite Bullets carrying Ice Oni, Queen's masterpiece virus according to himself. The gun was eventually destroyed by Zoro. Queen also carried a large pistol, but Marco kicked him into a tower before he could use it. He also used a more standard machine gun with seemingly normal bullets during his battle with Marco."},

His arms and legs are very thin in proportion to his wide frame, and his fingers are very thick and short. All this made Puppu resemble a pig. He wears a simple white shirt that was untucked from his red pirate sash, blue pants, and simple shoes. Like most pirate captains, he wears a pirate's coat, but he wore the sleeves instead of letting the coat drape over his shoulders like a cape. His coat is brown in color and has five large buttons that resemble pig snouts. He also wears a tricorn with his Jolly Roger on it: a square pig's skull with a snout, rounded teeth, and a leaf on top of its head.", "personality": "Puppu is prideful man, believing the Seven Warlords of the Sea to be pirates who sold their souls to the World Government, and are no more than their dogs. This made him believe that he and his crew were above Crocodile, a mistake that made him foolishly challenge the Warlord, which led to Puppu and his crew's defeat.", "abilities_and_powers": "Puppu is more or less an average pirate by strength, as he managed to make it along the Grand Line to Arabasta.

{"name": "PX-1", "episode": "Episode 511", "chapter": "Chapter 403", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "All the original Pacifista replicas seen were made identical in appearance to Bartholomew Kuma due to their clone statuses, even in his uncommon body proportion. The only distinguishing features between them and the genuine article are the lack of a Bible and Kuma's Nikyu Nikyu no Mi palm pads, though the latter is not initially apparent as they all wear similar gloves. Each Pacifista is considered to be a copy of Kuma, except for the original one who was gradually converted into a Pacifista. The Pacifista have the voice of Kuma, furthering their genuine replication to him. They are also under complete control of the World Government. Their appearances are so convincing that pirates unfamiliar with the genuine article believe they are the real Kuma. The Straw Hat Pirates, having previously fought Kuma, were able to tell the difference eventually. Likewise, X Drake, a former rear admiral familiar with the project, was aware of its nature. Some New World pirates were aware of Vegapunk's experiments, and that he sent several prototypes to handle incidents in the past, but were surprised that they were all modeled after Kuma. All Pacifista are labeled by the letters \"PX\", then a hyphen and a number, presumably indicating the order in which they were constructed. This label is printed on the right side of their necks. There appears to be around twenty of them in service as of the Summit War of Marineford, though it is unknown how many have been destroyed and built since then. On Egghead, there is at least one Pacifista unit that wears police uniform and tactical armor instead of Kuma's outfit. Due to the sleeves being disconnected, parts of the cybernetics around the shoulder areas are exposed. This unit also wears sunglasses. The upgraded Pacifista Mark III, which appear on Egghead under Sentomaru's command, is morphologically identical to a standard Pacifista modeled after Bartholomew Kuma, but wears differing clothes. This model is outfitted with a double-breasted jumpsuit bearing each individual's serial number on the chest, a hard combat helmet, aviator sunglasses, a reinforced metal collar, and gloves with palm-holes to dispense resin."},
{"name": "Pound", "episode": "Episode 831", "chapter": "Chapter 792", "year": 2016, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 835.", "appearance": "Pound is a very big man, with his head alone being twice the height of Carrot and significantly wider. He is shown to be much bigger and taller than even Oven who is 492cm tall. However, his head is the same size as the rest of his body, making him appear to be a giant when only his head is in view, and his legs are extremely disproportionately short. He has long, wavy light pink hair tied into a ponytail on top, a long and thin mustache, and a stubbly beard. His face is shaped like a pear, and he has rather small eyes which contrast with his very large nose and mouth. He wears a frilly light blue suit and dark pants that are tattered due to him being buried, and only has a shoe on his right foot. 26 years ago, Pound still had a stubble on his lip and wore a crown, an accessory that Big Mom's husbands are allowed to wear until she discards them.", "personality": "Pound has various quirks that can seem very weird to those who meet him, as he buried himself in the ground because he likes it and frequently talks about his craving for apple juice. He maintains a neutral attitude around those he meets and will often speak to them normally despite whatever is happening to them, not seeming to pay any mind to outside conflicts due to not wanting to get involved in them, though he can sometimes place his conviction in people he takes a liking to. He has a habit of speaking his mind, which can annoy those around him. He can be caring and brave. At the Seducing Woods, he attacked Brle when rescuing Nami. Unlike Linlin, he truly loves his daughters and did not hesitate to charge at Oven when he was threatening Chiffon. According to Big Mom, he was extremely stubborn and persistent in seeing his daughters no matter how many times he had been kicked out by Linlin and that conviction was enough for Chiffon and Lola to finally believe him to be their father. Content with having the chance to see Chiffon, Pound faced the prospect of death with a smile on his face. He cried with happiness at the sight of his grandson waving at him and seeing his daughter happy and safe.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pound has no fighting skills, however, his size alone is enough to intimidate others. Despite not being a fighter, Pound has shown a certain degree of durability, as he took a beating from someone as powerful as Oven and remained conscious. He was briefly unable to move due to his injuries, but recovered quickly enough to thwart Oven's attempt to prevent the Nostra Castello's escape from Cacao Island. Due to his large size, Pound has sufficient strength to use a large club to send two members of the Big Mom Pirates flying and enough leg strength to jump a far distance towards Oven in a single leap in the anime. In addition to being strong, Pound is also quite durable. He was able to withstand being pierced in the head by Randolph's spear while only feeling slight pain, most likely due to the large size of his head. He also managed to survive Oven's attempt on his life. He also has great eyesight, as he could identify and recognize his daughter Chiffon from a very far distance.

His eyes and nose are very close together, and are small compared to his large mouth. He has blushy, rosy cheeks and is usually seen with a toothy smile. When he uses his power, his appearance changes, resembling a fireball while his facial features remain, though he can take on a more sinister appearance. While sleeping, Prometheus does not exude any sun rays nor light, instead appearing a mere orb with a face floating in midair. When he was initially described by Pound, he had a fierier appearance and was surrounded by fireballs rather than sunrays. His facial features consisted of only slanted, pupilless eyes and a mouth. He took this appearance when joining with Big Mom to attack the Thousand Sunny.

Loyal to Big Mom, Prometheus would not hesitate to execute any traitors in cold blood, as he brutally incinerated Kingbaum while callously causing heavy casualties among other homies nearby. Prometheus has little faith in his fellow special homie Zeus, and repeatedly called him back and then scolded him when Zeus was lured into abandoning Big Mom to eat Nami's clouds. Prometheus seems to overall think lowly of Zeus, considering him a useless deadweight that only serves to drag Big Mom down, and eventually convinced her to replace him with a new thundercloud homie, Hera, whom Prometheus wanted as a girlfriend, but to his chagrin, she rejected him. Prometheus showed no regret at Zeus being disposed of by Linlin and Hera. Prior to fighting Brook, Prometheus had never been injured.

Being made of fire, he is immune to almost all physical attacks, even ones imbued with Busoshoku Haki (since he has no substantial body beneath his intangible effect), but can be harmed by water.

Prometheus can also be cut by the fire-cutting blade ability of Foxfire Style, and he expressed pain from the attack. As a sun, Prometheus can fly, and is able to produce incredibly powerful flames and explosions, strong enough to harm Vinsmoke Reiju while she was wearing a flame-resistant Raid Suit. When combining powers with Zeus, they can create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms. Prometheus can also attack by growing in size to gigantic proportions, dwarfing even the enormous Kingbaum, and falling down on his opponents, burning everything in a large radius around him to cinders. However, while Prometheus is in his gigantic size, he moves more sluggishly. Though very powerful, Prometheus's flames can be overpowered by those generated by the user of the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix, due to their special properties. He has the ability to sense Napoleon's whereabouts. Prometheus can also serve as Big Mom's mode of transportation, if Zeus is not available, and can become a part of Big Mom's hair, where he has the ability to burn anything he comes into contact with. Big Mom can also use Prometheus's flames to set Napoleon's blade alight in order to increase his attack power.

{"name": "Portgas D. Ace", "episode": "Episode 154", "chapter": "Chapter 91", "year": 2000, "note": "", "appearance": "Ace was a tall muscular young man with curly black hair. Although they were not blood related, Ace looked remarkably like his foster brother, Luffy. However, Ace was more serious looking than Luffy's lighthearted design, and was also taller and more muscular. He also sported rather childish freckles (inherited from his mother) and tended to make a skeptical facial expression by raising his left eyebrow. Interestingly, his facial features were almost akin to his biological father Gol D. Roger in his youth without his mustache. Ace's tattoos were among his most remarkable, trademark features. He had a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbolpurple bones formed in a cross behind a purple skull with a white mustachethat he described as his pride and joy. Ace had another tattoo on his upper left bicep that spells \"ASCE\" vertically. The \"S\" crossed out is a tribute to Sabo as that's his jolly roger. On the cover of Chapter 596 indeed, Ace's tattoo is written as \"ACE\" instead of the original \"ASCE\" as the cover is a \"what if\" image of Ace, Luffy, and Sabo together as adults with the former being known to be alive. Ace wore an open-front shirt until he received Whitebeard's tattoo - afterwards, he stopped wearing anything over his upper body except when on winter or desert islands due to the weather requirements. He wore black boots, black knee-length shorts with an eyelet-studded orange belt, and a blue pouch belted around his left leg. He also wore a short second belt with a large red \"A\" on the silver buckle over his right hip, but left it unfastened and threaded the free end along the back of his shorts. A dagger in a green sheath hung at his left hip. On Ace's left arm, he wore a Log Pose and a red and white striped bracelet around his wrist, an orange elbow guard, and his \"ASCE\" tattoo. He wore a red beaded necklace and an orange hat with two blue smileys, one frowning and one smiling, and a string of red beads sitting above the rim. Two long orange side straps hung down sides of his hat and met at a large medallion of a bull's skull with orange tassels. Unfortunately, Ace lost his trademark hat, which he already had when he began his journey as a pirate, on Banaro Island as a result of his duel with Blackbeard. His knife was also apparently confiscated, as he no longer had it in his next appearance as a prisoner at Impel Down. The tattoo upon his back that he took so much pride in was later destroyed by the same blow that eventually led to his death. However, at his grave, Ace's hat and knife were placed at his tombstoneeither they were retrieved, or they were duplicates in Ace's possession. During the ending credits in the second movie, Clockwork Island Adventure, previews of upcoming characters from the Baroque Works Saga were featured. Ace was also included amongst the many characters, but while his clothes were almost identical, he boasted a very different color scheme to the one he was given in his official appearance in the anime. As a child, Ace is shown to have often worn t-shirts with two-kanji phrases on the front (such as \"innocence\" and \"violence\"). On some occasions they are linked to the scene in which they were worn, like \"independence\" when the three brothers built their own tree house to live in. He often wore knee-length shorts and a black elbow guard on his left arm. Ace was always seen wearing dark brown, flat, slipper-like shoes, and in the winter, he wore a green cardigan over his normal clothes. Upon leaving Dawn Island at the age of 17, he wore an outfit identical to the one he wore when he first met Whitebeard; however, he was less muscular than he eventually grew to be and had rounder, more childlike facial features.", "personality": "Ace was much more intelligent, polite, and generally, more bearable than Luffy, which prompted the Straw Hat Pirates to question whether he was truly related to their captain. While several people who knew Gol D. Roger noted Luffy is quite similar to the late Pirate King, Whitebeard himself claimed that Ace's personality was not at all like his father's. It seems that among the very few things the brothers shared was their recklessness as pirates (and their near-bottomless stomachs). In addition, Ace liked to party as much as his brother does. When he boarded Buggy's ship, he was drawn by the smell of food and decided to enjoy himself while he was there. Ace could be a bit inappropriate though as he once used a woman's skirt to wipe his face while he was dining at Spice Bean in Arabasta. There were two running gags about Ace. The first was his rather extreme narcolepsy. He tended to randomly fall asleep while eating and conversing, leaving strangers around him wondering if he had died. This was first seen in Arabasta when they thought he died in the middle of eating. The second was that he did a \"dine and dash\" routine wherever he went. This went back to his younger days with Sabo and Luffy, when they would often dine and dash in the city of Goa, and carried over to adulthood, as shown on three occasions when he was on Drum Island, Arabasta, and Lulusia Kingdom. Ace was also shown to be quite impulsive, much like his younger brother, as he too would make hasty decisions and, in some cases, neglect listening to reason. This was shown that shortly prior to setting out to hunt Blackbeard for killing Thatch. Whitebeard insisted that Ace should not go after him, yet Ace, despite his immense loyalty and respect for his captain, ignored his warnings and went off to find his former subordinate. Another, albeit more humorous example, was in his mini-story, where during his hunt for Blackbeard, he mistook a man named Dr. Blackbeard for his target, due to coincidentally having a similar name and appearance to Teach. Rather than check to see if he found the man he was looking for, Ace jumped to conclusions too soon and attacked the doctor on sight. It was by then Ace realized too late that he had the wrong man, which got him into a lot of trouble with the villagers. His \"politeness\" is due to Makino's teaching after Ace asked her how to introduce himself to Shanks (being his brother's savior). Before that, Ace was rather cold and rude to anyone he was not familiar with. As the son of Roger, he lived in his shadow and is to date the first D. depicted to truly question his own right to exist, while displaying the fewest commonly seen D. related traits. Ace seemed to have lifelong problems dealing with his parentage, even after denouncing Gol D. Roger and accepting Whitebeard as his only father. This was in direct contrast to Luffy, who accepted his father's identity immediately upon learning it and did not seem to care when he was told how dangerous of a man he was. However, Luffy did not grow up with knowledge of the identity (or even the existence) of his father. Ace believed that it was natural if he were to really die as nobody in the world wanted the son of the devil (Roger) to live. This caused him to be surprised and shocked that Whitebeard would easily accept him in his crew despite him being the son of Whitebeard's rival and that the entire Whitebeard Pirates' crew and allies and Luffy would risk their lives in order to save him. Ace commented upon his own death that he had never sought fame or fortune - all he had wanted was the answer to his lifelong question of whether or not he should have been born, as this was the only thing preventing him from dying with no regrets as he and Luffy had vowed to do so and the fact he had a younger brother to look out for. Ace's only regret was that he would not live to see Luffy achieve his dream, which he believed Luffy undoubtedly would accomplish as he was his little brother. Benn Beckman of the Red Hair Pirates described Ace's personality to be naiver than his appearance would suggest. He compared Ace's characteristics to be more aligned with the Revolutionary Army's, considering his personal vendetta against the world denying his existence. Ace is described to be more of a fighter than a Pirate, making Beckman think Ace is unfit to be captain of a fleet. Ace had a tendency to never back down from a fight, saying that he would never run once facing an enemy. Also like his father and brother, Ace was confident and fearless when confronting his opponents even when they were extremely powerful people such as Whitebeard or admirals like Aokiji or Akainu, though like Luffy, he could also underestimate his opponents. When Blackbeard demonstrated the power of the Yami Yami no Mi, Ace was unfazed, not viewing it as a threat to himself and only showed shock and fear when Teach used his power to grab him and cancel his Devil Fruit powers. He also tried to kill Whitebeard at least a hundred times despite the massive difference in strength between them and each of his attempts failing miserably. Because of this, some people believed that Ace had a death wish, but in truth, he wanted to prevent the people he cared for from getting hurt. Dadan stated that he inherited this tendency from his father despite loathing him. While Ace emerged victorious over enemies he refused to run from, such as Porchemy and Bluejam, his stubbornness hurt him on a number of occasions, particularly when he refused to back down against Blackbeard or Admiral Akainu. Ace was also easily provoked by and became violent towards anyone who insulted or harmed people close to him. In one of Garp's conversations with Curly Dadan, this was revealed to be a trait of Roger as well. During his childhood, Ace had a tendency to severely injure anyone who insulted Roger, though he himself disliked his biological father. After hearing about Sabo's presumed death at the hands of a World Noble, Ace quickly became bent on killing the Noble and Dadan had to pin Ace down and tie him to a tree to stop him. Ace's temper got the better of him, especially in cases when Whitebeard, proclaimed by Ace to be his only father, was insulted. Believing that this was the case when Blackbeard broke the iron rule of the Whitebeard Pirates and fled after murdering a crewmate, Ace pursued his traitorous subordinate despite his crewmates' efforts and even Whitebeard's orders to stop him. Ace later came to see that his stubbornness had gotten him into the ordeal of being scheduled for execution. Even though he managed to escape death on the scaffold thanks to the pirates' and Luffy's efforts at Marineford and was well on his way to freedom, Admiral Akainu got to him by insulting Whitebeard. Ace quickly turned back to face him, ignoring his crewmates' warnings to not become angered over Akainu's provocations. Unwilling to let him get away of speaking ill of Whitebeard, Ace attacked him out of fury only to have his arm burned by Akainu's Devil Fruit powers. Akainu then took the opportunity to attack Luffy on the sideline, leading Ace to jump in, sacrificing his life to shield Luffy from the attack. While saying his last words, Ace sadly admitted to Luffy that he (Ace) wasted away all of his efforts to rescue him. Although Ace follows the creed of loyalty towards those close to him, such as taking the excessive effort to rescue Luffy from Bluejam or hunting down Teach to avenge Thatch, he was not above using underhanded methods to win a fight at times. Noted examples included trying to stab Whitebeard in his sleep or chopping him down with an axe from behind. Alongside his loyalty is Ace does not judge people by their appearance and race, but by their character, as he took in both Ganryu (a Longarm) and Wallace (a Fish-Man) into his crew while society had shunned both of them.", "abilities_and_powers": "As commander of the 2nd division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Ace had authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. In addition, as one of the top commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, he was one of the strongest and most highly regarded pirates on board under Whitebeard himself. At one point, while being captain of the Spade Pirates, he was even asked to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea but refused. Ace was strong enough to be acknowledged by the Emperors Shanks and Blackbeard, with the former saying he had earned his spot as Whitebeard's 2nd division commander and the latter wishing Ace had joined his crew and emphasizing how his own formidable crew was nowhere near strong enough to combat Ace at the time, speaking volumes about Ace's strength. Luffy commented on how he never defeated Ace in a single fight, despite Luffy already having the power of the Gomu Gomu no Mi (Ace did not consume the Mera Mera no Mi until after he left: Luffy was surprised by Ace's new power when Ace stopped Smoker from capturing him in Nanohana). Ace was trained by Garp, who had hoped to turn him into a fine Marine, and possibly Dadan, the two of whom were responsible for training Luffy to the level of power he held before becoming a pirate. Ace also held a fearsome reputation. It was revealed that Ace received an invitation to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea while he was still captain of the Spade Pirates, though he refused the offer, which had subsequently raised his bounty over 100,000,000 and attracted even more attention to him across the New World. He had defeated Doma, a notorious New World pirate, and his pirate crew all on his own, which is what got him recommended for his current post as the Whitebeard Pirates' 2nd division commander. Due to Ace's prestige and heritage, the World Government not only granted Blackbeard the position of Warlord for successfully defeating and capturing Ace but also imprisoned Ace in Level 6 of Impel Down, a secret level reserved for the world's most dangerous and brutal criminals. His overall reputation and abilities had earned him a bounty of 550,000,000 prior to his capture and death. According to Sengoku, Ace had especially immense potential, described that it was Ace's rapid rise in power and fame that made the World Government realize he was son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He went on to say that in time, Ace could potentially become the next Pirate King if he continued on, which was the most important reason why the World Government was willing to start a war with Whitebeard. Chinjao himself said that Ace showed the most potential among the new generation pirates, and that his death was a good thing for the Marines. He was also a capable navigator, as he was seen wearing a Log Pose on his left wrist, while traveling from island to island in search of Luffy and Blackbeard on a simple raft. This also shows he was a skilled tracker. Ace's willpower was strong enough to withstand Shanks' outburst of Haoshoku Haki. Aside from the powers granted by the Devil Fruit he consumed, Ace possessed immense physical strength and endurance which he attained from the extremely rigorous training in the harsh environment of Mt. Colubo that consisted of him hunting and fighting wild beasts since childhood and traveling in precarious trap-filled locations. His incredible physical prowess was supplemented by his extraordinary fighting skills. Even in his early childhood, he was able to beat some local thugs who spoke ill of his father \"half to death\" and during his first meeting with Luffy, he was also shown sitting on top of a huge bull he killed with his staff. As a child, he could also easily break a giant tree with a single kick. In his childhood, before he acquired the Mera Mera no Mi, Ace was able to beat Luffy in every single sparring match, despite Luffy's untrained Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities. Ace demonstrated his strength during his battle with Blackbeard: he was able to take Blackbeard's punches, which were so powerful that the first made Ace cough up blood and the second nearly broke his neck and retaliate quickly afterwards. Van Augur noted that, as expected of the Whitebeard Pirates' 2nd division commander, Ace's basic combat skills were quite formidable even without his Devil Fruit powers. He had shown to fight equally with both Yamato and Jinbe in the past, both being situations where his adversaries used Haki (and in addition in Jinbe's case, Fish-Man Karate) to nullify Ace's Logia powers. Ace and Jinbe in particular had nearly killed each other in a fight that lasted for five days straight. Ace then survived a battle with Whitebeard that took place immediately after, showing immense stamina and durability. As a testament to his stamina and endurance, he was one of the few people to be able to take a \"baptizing\" in boiling water in Impel Down without flinching, which is considered an impressive feat. Ace ate the Mera Mera no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to create, control, and transform his body into fire. He could create and unleash massive amounts of fire for large-scale damage, as well as utilize small precision attacks. Later, after his death, it was revealed that Ace's burning fists also had the power to annihilate entire cities. Ace primarily used his flames for a wide variety of offenses. He could shoot fire bullets and spears, release powerful fire cannons, unleash massive waves of fire, and create fire balls, both a single large one for large-scale destruction and multiple small ones that could explode. His signature attack was transforming his fist into fire and sending it forward as it greatly increased in size, earning him the name \"Fire Fist Ace\". His flames could also be used defensively, he could create a massive wall of flames to block his opponents, and the heat of his flames could deter his opponents from attacking him for fear of getting burned. He was also able to stop powerful ice attacks from Aokiji, a Marine Admiral. Ace also had practical uses for his Devil Fruit powers; he would heat up any fish he would find in the seas for his crew when they had no food to eat and he was able to traverse the seas in a one-man boat that was specifically designed for him and propelled with flames from his feet. Ace was one of the very few people in the world who could use all three types of Haki. Despite this, he rarely used them in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit abilities. While Ace has never show usage of Busoshoku Haki or Kenbunshoku Haki within the manga, The Novels have stated that Ace's Haki had been described by Shanks and Benn Beckman to be fiery in nature, to the point that Aces very presence was able to stop blizzards on an island for as long as he was there. As such, when he turned up on Drum Island, no snow fell at all on the island for an entire day. Ace possessed Haoshoku Haki, which he initially had no conscious control over. He first demonstrated the ability at 10 years of age when he rendered the Bluejam Pirates except for Bluejam unconscious after an outburst of rage. He later gained knowledge of the power, as he recognized it when Luffy used it at the Summit War of Marineford. He was never seen using this Haki apart from in his childhood, save for in video games (such as during the activation of his Kizuna Rush in Pirate Warriors 3) and the manga adaptation of the novel. It was stated in One Piece novel A that Ace could use Busoshoku Haki, though this was not seen within the manga. Upon awakening it, he was capable of fighting on equal grounds with Vice Admiral Draw with Busoshoku Haki. However, it is not known how proficient he was in using it since then, though the manga adaptation of the novel about his character suggests he was skilled at it, to the point he leaned on it too much and was negligent in training the other forms of his Haki. Although Ace has never been seen using Kenbunshoku Haki in the manga or the novel, nor has he been confirmed to have it in the databooks, in the manga adaptation of the novel, he was shown to have been trained by Thatch in its usage and uses it in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers in his duel against Whitebeard. Ace carries around a knife but is never seen using it. However, in flashbacks of attempts to assassinate Whitebeard, Ace was shown using various weapons, including an axe and a knife. As a child, he used a long bo staff made from pipe as a weapon. In One Piece: Burning Blood, Ace wields two twin double-barreled firearms (which resemble a cross between a pistol and a sawed-off shotgun) while wearing his Strong World costume which he uses as part of his Twin Guns & Cross Fire special attack."},

He was seemingly a ruthless pirate, due to his intolerance of Luffy and the degree of violence he used to interrogate Luffy to talk, along with Sabo's claim that he skins the heads of those he fights. He appeared to have some sense of pride for his status as a pirate, as he said that \"he will quit being a pirate\" if he is beaten by kids.", "abilities_and_powers": "He appeared to have some knowledge about Devil Fruits, as he did not appear shocked learning about Luffy's powers and quickly decided on a method that could harm Luffy. He wields a sword, resembling a cutlass, and is skilled enough to cut an iron pipe with it. Despite this, he was defeated by the combined efforts of Ace and Sabo. He also had spiked gloves to increase the damage done from his punches and was strong enough to wield a very large mallet. Both of those weapons were only shown for torturing Luffy though."},

He also wears a puffed collar around his neck, a white sash, tan shorts, and sandals, and he is usually seen carrying maracas. He has a red star tattoo on his chest. In the manga, he was overweight, but in the anime, he was quite muscular. When the Arlong Pirates first arrived at Cocoyasi Village, Pisaro wore a flower-patterned shirt. When he was a member of the Sun Pirates, Pisaro wore similar attire, and the anime kept his slimmer appearance.

It is shown in a flashback that even as a nine-year-old child he possessed a similar hulking frame, while also wearing a silvery metal chainmail headguard and a pale yellow knights helmet, in addition to a white sleeveless t-shirt and black pants, that he would have until adulthood. By the age of 24, he had replaced his makeshift armor from childhood to real golden armor and took to wearing black gloves. His hair is long and lavender, wavy and light, which hangs down to his shoulders. It appears that under his mask, he has a straight mustache. His eyes are yellow. The most distinctive features on his body are his shoulders, which have three (previously two) spikes protruding out of each shoulder blade that appears to be part of his actual flesh; his shoulder grew to this point since he was wearing shoulder guards of such shape since puberty, thus causing them to shape like so. He is considerably taller than normal people, appearing as tall as Trebol and Diamante. There is a tattoo of a (black in the manga, purple in the anime) spade on the front side of both his shoulders. He wears a yellow-gold spiked helmet with a narrow four-pointed star on the front with a spade on the top point; the star covers his eyes in a visor-like fashion. Ten years ago, he wore dark gauntlets and white bandages on both of his hands that go up halfway to his shoulders. He also wears a metallic belt with a black spade emblem with a light-colored outline on the front attached by chains in a manner resembling suspenders, albeit with chains wrapping around his hips and from front-to-back instead around his body, over a pteruges skirt in the manga. In the anime they are golden-yellow colored. Underneath his pteruges is a pair of dark underwear. He also wears a pair of light-colored greaves, and a large pair of black gloves (golden-yellow in the anime) that reaches up to his forearms. His most recent appearance also shows him wearing a light-colored spade shaped armored chest plate with the spade symbol attached by light-colored leather straps and a metal chain in-between the light-colored leather straps at the top, with armor plating stretched and wrapped around his sides, and black and white armbands (light-brown and yellow gold in the anime) just around his elbows. Of all the elite officers of the Donquixote Pirates, he is the most muscular and with the biggest and widest arms, hands and fingers, which are adorned with black gloves (purple in the anime) that reach up to his forearms. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Pica is shown with a large frame, wearing only a small vest which exposed his chest, tattered shorts, and wore no shoes.", "personality": "Pica seems to be a quiet individual, likely due to his surprisingly high pitched voice for his size. He is extremely sensitive about his voice, and in the event he does speak and is laughed at, he gets extremely upset, going as far as to brutally murder people for it. He also has some pride in his sword, as he was offended just as easily when Zoro insulted is laugh. He is very loyal to Doflamingo as he abandoned his battle with Zoro to protect Doflamingo after the Warlord's string puppet was decapitated by Kyros. He also considers his crew as his family, as he set out personally to seek out the enemies who threaten their safety. Likewise, he firmly believes Doflamingo is the rightful king of Dressrosa and the country belongs to the family. Pica is also dishonest with wounded gladiators, attacking them indiscriminately. However, as seen when Machvise ran from Pica's large scale attack after Luffy angered the latter, there are times where his anger gets the better of him and he may neglect the safety of his family. Also, he did not hesitate to insult Diamante for losing to Kyros, while not even bothering to give Baby 5 a chance to explain anything before attacking her for assumed treason. He believes strongly in his Devil Fruit abilities, saying that he alone would be enough to defeat the enemies in Dressrosa and prevent them from getting to Doflamingo. He openly said that three or three hundred people made no difference to him. He is also confident in his Haki claiming Zoro would be unable to cut him after he imbued his entire body with it. This arrogance led him to underestimating Zoro, who defeated him with his own Haki. Like many One Piece characters, Pica has a distinct laugh: \"Pikkya-pikkya-pikkyarara\", something he's also sensitive about.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pica occupies the Spade seat in the Donquixote Pirates as one of its top three elite officers and strongest members, just after Doflamingo himself. As such, he commanded his own subdivision, the Pica Army, with Gladius, Buffalo, and Baby 5 (before her defection), all of whom specialized as an assault squad, as his subordinates. Even as a 9-year-old, Pica was strong enough to burn down an entire town alongside Vergo, Trebol and Diamante, all of whom were children, as well as possessing knowledge of Haki, particularly that those who possess Haoshoku Haki are qualified to become king. At 30 years old, Pica, along with Trebol and Diamante, was able to defeat the entire army of Dressrosa. Viola also expressed worry during multiple instances regarding the interference of Pica in Luffy, Zoro, and Viola's entering of the royal palace, which further suggests Pica's might. Pica himself was confident that he alone was all that was necessary to put an end to the Straw Hats and former Colosseum fighters. Due to his immense size, Pica is extremely strong. He is capable of lifting up his giant katana that is bigger than him, and wielded it without any difficulty when he was about to hit Luffy with it or during his fight with Zoro. In the anime, a 9-year-old Pica was shown liftingtwo men up before slamming them against each other. Even while wounded, Pica managed to survive a long fall from the air, which just left him unconscious. Pica has sufficient skill in swordsmanship to hold his own against Zoro. Pica ate the Ishi Ishi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to assimilate his body into any and all stone he comes into contact with, as well as manipulate it. In areas composed entirely of stone, he can swim through the stone like water and move around the environment at will and do so at unusually fast speeds. He can freely shift the geography of any environment made of stone. He has absolute control over the environment, making him a formidable opponent. A notable ability of this power is that he can morph the stone around himself into a gigantic stone golem. Pica uses an unnamed giant katana suiting his own size (or even bigger than him, parallel to the one Squard wielded) with an oval-shaped tsuba. He hid this blade inside the stone of the giant replica of himself and is first seen using it in an attempt to cut down Luffy and Ucy, but Luffy jumped over it, and Zoro intercepted the second swing. He can also use the stone he assimilated to extend his arm's reach to stab at long range. Pica can use Busoshoku Haki, and has displayed the ability to coat his entire body in it, similar to Vergo. Pica was confident that his Haki could protect him from all attacks when his stone body was disabled. However, it is inferior to Roronoa Zoro's Haki, as the latter was able to cut through it, and thus Pica, with his Busoshoku Haki-imbued swords. Pica possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

This is supposed to allow Gan Fall to ride Pierre and travel in the skies, but as noted by the Straw Hat crew, since Pierre is already able to carry Gan Fall in his original giant bird form his power seems quite useless aside from the aesthetic effect. However, Pierre can use his powers as a horse offensively (albeit for comedic effects), by using his horse teeth to bite the head of anyone who's talking bad about his master in front of him."},

He is also very impatient, yelling at his opponents for taking to long to pick their ball-man. While he finds arguing annoying, he is amused when his opponents are unable to work well together. He is quite cocky abouthis and his team's abilities, and he quickly becomes nervous when a strong opponent catches him off guard. Pickles lacks respect for his opponents, as he is willing to cheat against them to win (a standard behavior for the Foxy Pirates). He never openly acknowledges his own cheating and rather celebrates his own victories despite his use of foul play. He seems to enjoy hurting his opponents, smirking and laughing when he and his team viciously assaulted Sanji and Zoro during their match. When Pickles revealed his swords against Zoro and Sanji, he mockingly laughed and sang about slicing them up, demonstrating his devious nature. Like the rest of the Groggy Monsters, Pickles is a bit dumb and tends to laugh regularly with little reason. He, however, seems to be the smartest and strongest of the three, and was defeated last by Zoro and Sanji. When his crew was defeated in a Davy Back Fight by the Straw Hat Pirates, Pickles was mature and respectful of their victory. He seemed prepared for a new challenge when the Straw Hat Pirates were deciding who to pick for their crew, and he was shocked and appalled like the rest of his crew by their decision to take their Jolly Roger and replace it with Luffy's drawing.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pickles' specialty is tackling and spinning. He is capable of tackling down opponents as well as spinning at great speeds. While he is a formidable opponent by himself, he is made more formidable when teamed up with his teammates, Hamburg and Big Pan. Together they are capable of performing team combinations that often overwhelm their opponents. In the special, Adventure of Nebulandia, Pickles fights with his fists. However, his use of this combat style is non-canon. He normally participates in a Groggy Ring match without weapons. However, should the chance present itself, he will use illegal equipment as long the referee \"does not\" look at the field. His hidden equipment includes spiked pauldrons and swords. The spiked pauldrons make his tackles more deadly while his swords are deadly utensils when he spins around with them. The latter weapons are used in conjunction with his teammates' own concealed weapons for a devastating combo, Monster Burger. The attacks he uses in the Groggy Ring are as follows:"},

Pell appears to have a soft side, gently conversing with Vivi as a child when she asked about his role as a guardian, and using his Devil Fruit abilities to give her a ride. It seems that Pell is very fond of Vivi, as he is shown with a happy smile while flying with Vivi in his flashback before sacrificing himself to save Alubarna from the bomb.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pell is renowned as Arabasta's strongest warrior.With the aid of his Devil Fruit powers, he dispatched a group of Baroque Works agents in mere seconds.

Carrying the bomb is also a demonstration of immense physical strength, as, even in his falcon form, the bomb was both completely made of metal and at least twice Pell's size. Pell ate the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Falcon, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a falcon, which has earned him the nickname \"Pell the Falcon\".

He also has a liking for chocolate, and is willing to admit that to people. He carries around a list of bounties on wanted people such as pirates and takes note of the people he has seen on bounty posters, as seen when he took the time to look up Caribou even when the latter was about to fire at him with a Gatling gun. He acknowledges that merely possessing a Logia-type Devil Fruit does not make the user invincible, commenting that anyone who thinks so will have a swift downfall. He has some level of pride in his own Devil Fruit abilities, as he expressed mild disappointment that Luffy did not react to his fruit's defensive capabilities being likened to diamond. He also has a strong attachment to his former home as shown when he offered to let the Straw Hats go when he found out they saved the Mink Tribe from Jack. He was even willing to lie to Big Mom to help them. He was also willing to capture his own crewmate Charlotte Brle in order to honor Pedro's sacrifice for the Straw Hats. According to Wanda, he used to be known as a delinquent on Zou. According to Jinbe, he has a strong sense of duty, as he refused to aid Bege in his scheme to kill Big Mom. While grumpy with a ferocious temper, Pekoms genuinely cares for the people he is close to, as shown when he broke down crying when Pedro was almost killed by Big Mom's life span absorption powers. Like several members of the Mink Tribe, Pekoms has a quirk related to the behavior of the animal he resembles.

Pekoms has proven himself to be extremely agile as shown when he dodged the slash ofCaribou's scythe. Pekoms instantly disappeared like a Soru user and retaliated just as quickly. He has extreme superhuman strength as he knocked out Caribou, who is a new super rookie with a bounty of 210,000,000, with a single Haki enhanced punch, breaking the latter's weapon in the same instant.The tremendous force of his punch sent Caribou flying back in the process. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Pekoms is a born warrior who can use Electro. As a mink, Pekoms is capable of transforming into a Sulong form by gazing at the full moon. In his Sulong form, his natural fighting abilities are significantly increased. However, this increase in power did not prevent Pekoms from being overwhelmed by an army of several thousand Big Mom Pirates. He also has difficulty controlling his Sulong form, with only the words of Pedro being able to break him out of his mindless ferocious state. Pekoms ate the Kame Kame no Mi, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full turtle and a mink-turtle hybrid at will. His turtle form gives him a protective shell around his torso, which he can sink his head, arms, and legs into. The shell is very resilient, allegedly hard as diamond, as it took many bullets from a Gatling gun and did not show any signs of damage afterwards. It also allowed him to survive the majority of Bege's assault to his back, showing his quick reflexes to transform in time. Pekoms is skilled inBusoshoku Haki,which he used to strike Caribou, a Logia user, incapacitating him in one hit. Pekoms possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki.

She still has her signature parasol, and also carries a stuffed animal resembling Kumashi with her. Additionally, she now wears her hair in multiple spiral braids on the back of her head. While reading about the Straw Hats' actions on Dressrosa and resulting new bounties, she wore a collared shirt with short, ruffled sleeves and a short dark tie hung loosely around her neck. She wore short frilly skirt witha line of crosses. She had short boots with bows on the front. She also had a large straw hat with a bow and large crown on top of it.", "personality": "Perona has a very young, childlike and immature personality; frequently acting selfishly and on her own whims. She dislikes people telling her what to do and disobeying her will. Despite this, she is normally loyal to Gecko Moria and apparently sees him as a father-like role model, as she was crying to rejoin him after being sent to Kuraigana Island. After Zoro appeared on Kuraigana as well, she tended to his wounds, displaying a willingness to befriend even those she formerly knew as a foe and demonstrating that she can be kind to others, despite her normally cruel demeanor. She is very fond of cute things and will only allow someone to work for her if they are cute. Her dream is to create a kingdom where all the cute things in the world have been turned into zombie animals that obey only her. She dislikes Kumashi because, although he is cute in appearance, his voice is not, and thus she prefers him to just be quiet. Her desire for cute things gives her a slightly childish outlook on some issues. She is somewhat playful during combat, threatening to crush Usopp's heart when she was in her ghost form, which nearly caused Usopp to die from fear, and shortly afterward merely laughing it off when revealing that she could not do so. Perona has katsaridaphobia, a fear of cockroaches, to the point of screaming and crying when Usopp covered her with fake ones. She is also somewhat naive, having watched Usopp seemingly lift a 10-ton hammer without questioning whether or not his feat was genuine, and shortly afterward passing out from fear when he attacked her with it, despite not actually being harmed. She is very confident in her Devil Fruit powers being able to defeat anyone. Even when confronted by the powerful and dreaded Warlord of the Sea Bartholomew Kuma, after initially being frozen with fear, Perona quickly regained her confidence and proclaimed that she would defeat him. She is also quite stubborn about using them in combat, having continued to use her Negative Hollows against Usopp even after they proved useless due to his negativity because she believed that his immunity was a fluke. After the timeskip, she has become more mature, although she still carries a teddy bear around, indicating that she is still obsessed with cuteness to some degree. She displayed a grateful side, as she tearfully thanked Dracule Mihawk for letting her stay on his island. Like many others, Perona has her own unique laugh, which uses the word Horo (e.g., \"Horo-horo-horo-horo-horo!\"); this is based on the name of her Devil Fruit, the Horo Horo no Mi.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being formerly one of the Mysterious Four, Perona had a number of zombies under her command prior to her defection from Thriller Bark. Her ex-crewmate, Doctor Hogback, acknowledges her value under Moria's employment. Perona is physically strong, as she was seen carrying Kumashi's body, which is bigger than she is, while levitating with her Devil Fruit powers. Perona is able to cook, having cooked several times during the two years while she was living with Mihawk. While she seems to recognize that bandages can help a person who is wounded, she seems to lack expertise in medicine. During the process of treating Zoro's wounds, she covered him from head to toe in an overabundance of bandages the first time she found him. However, despite this fault, she has common sense or enough knowledge of medical skills, as Zoro recovered from his injuries. She is a capable navigator, demonstrated when she brought Zoro to Sabaody Archipelago all the way from Kuraigana Island. She later traveled to Thriller Bark and returned back to Kuraigana Island all by herself. After learning Moria was alive, she traveled to all the way to Hachinosu from Kuraigana Island, going from Paradise to the New World. Perona ate the Horo Horo no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to create and control ghosts. The ghosts have the power to drain the morale, self-esteem, and will to live of anyone whom they pass through, described as hollowing out the victim's spirit. She can also create smaller ghosts that explode with enough force to damage stone walls and larger ghosts that produce an even more powerful blast. Her ghosts can also be used to form a \"Ghost Network\" for surveillance. This allows her to spy on enemies. The ghosts can also duplicate themselves into even more ghosts. In addition to creating ghosts, she can make her own ghost leave her body. Her disembodied ghost is completely intangible; she can pass through solid objects and cannot be hit by enemy attacks, although she cannot damage anything or attack her opponents physically. Her ghost also has the power to levitate and can change the size of her spectral body. However, while she is doing this, her true body remains unconscious and vulnerable."},
{"name": "Pedro", "episode": "Episode 805", "chapter": "Chapter 754", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Pedro was a large, male feline mink with spotted fur, white ears, and long, wavy blonde hair. He gave up his left eye to Big Mom during his time as a pirate captain, and afterwards covered his scar with his hair. He also had a torn left ear. Upon entering Totto Land, Pedro donned a dress shirt with floral-like frills down the middle, a dark cape with the same frills on the edge, and a large dark hat which partially obscures his face. When meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, he wore a green suit with a black shirt and a red ascot along with a green fedora.", "personality": "Pedro was extremely loyal to whomever he follows, and was often overly eager to use violence to help his allies during tense situations without waiting for discussion. As a Guardian, he was willing to lay down his life in order to defend the Whale Forest against intruders, though he admitted that he and the rest of the Guardians are a bit too sensitive to intruders, and would call off an attack if asked to do so. However, when not on duty as a Guardian, Pedro could be very cautious and distrusting toward strangers, quickly preparing to use force against anyone he feels may be a threat to him and his friends even if they seem to be friendly, as demonstrated during his first encounter with Charlotte Pudding. He seemed to like standing in trees and other high places, as fitting for his nickname, and was sometimes intense when he got up close to people. According to Tamago, Pedro used to highly prioritize his own survival when he was a pirate captain. He willingly gave up his left eye in order to prove to Big Mom that he needed to return to Zou alive and witness \"the dawn of the world\". Pedro believed this dream has come to fruition with the Straw Hats, so he was fine with dying as soon as his obligations to the Straw Hats were fulfilled. As a result, he became a rather reckless fighter willing to go great lengths against enemies due to his lack of regard for his own safety. He was also very perceptive and cautious; he was the only member of the Sanji Retrieval Team to be suspicious of Charlotte Pudding's motives due to her connection to Big Mom, which was later proven correct. He also berated Carrot for stowing away on the journey to Totto Land, reminding her of the danger they were heading into.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Guardians, Pedro had command over them, though his position and authority were below those of Nekomamushi. He also had full command over the Nox Pirates as their captain until they were defeated and dissolved. Nonetheless, the World Government acknowledged his strength and threat as a pirate, enough to have a 382,000,000 bounty placed on his head. Having traveled through the seas in search of Poneglyphs, Pedro was experienced and knowledgeable of various facts, such as the geography of Totto Land and the hierarchy and powers of the Big Mom Pirates. Pedro was shown to possess a strong will as he was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki. Pedro was very pragmatic in battle, using a large variety of battle tactics and weapons and going to great lengths in order to attain victory, disregarding any code of honor. Pedro would even attack his opponent if they were down but still had a chance of returning for battle. His ingenuity and deception was further shown when he created a massive explosion to annihilate his enemies while appearing to commit suicide when in reality, he escaped into a nearby mirror through Brle's Devil Fruit powers, deceiving the Big Mom Pirates including the intelligent Niwatori to think he was dead. As the captain of the Guardians, Pedro was an extremely powerful warrior even for a mink and could use Electro. He had tremendous tolerance to pain, having gouged out his left eye with only slight discomfort, and also stood up after being poisoned and tortured by Jack, who tortured only the strongest mink warriors. He could also jump to great heights from a standing position. He was very stealthy, as Monkey D. Luffy, a proficient Kenbunshoku Haki user, did not sense him hiding in the trees above him. His great stealth capabilities allowed him to sneak inside a Biscuit Soldier together with Brook and also to eavesdrop on Tamago without the latter noticing. He was also extremely fast and agile, allowing him to run on walls. He used this speed in conjunction with his swordsmanship to unleash hit-and-run attacks on opponents. During his fight against Tamago, he was shown able to spin his tail to use it as a helicopter to float and move in mid-air. Pedro was shown to be an extremely skilled swordsman, as his sword swings are powerful enough to break through shields and armor, and he often attacked while running past his enemies rather than in a conventional manner. His swordsmanship was great enough to fight on par with Tamago, a powerful member of the Big Mom Pirates, and he managed to cut Tamago's eye in one of their battles as well as defeat two of his forms in their final battle. To utilize his swordsmanship, Pedro wielded a variety of bladed weapons. During the battle with the Beasts Pirates on Zou, Pedro wielded a large machete. Upon his departure from Zou and during the Whole Cake Island Arc, he wielded a rapier. Pedro possessed a large stockpile of dynamite-shaped explosives, which he kept inside his jacket while in Totto Land. He used a single stick in order to cause a hit-and-run explosion in the Whole Cake Chateau hallways, and later detonated several on the third floor courtyard to annihilate a large horde of enemies with a massive explosion, which acted as a smokescreen as he escaped into the Mirror World. He later lit up the stash in his jacket which caused a massive explosion that engulfed both Perospero and himself, and even though it did not harm Big Mom, it was powerful enough to hurl her several feet away. Pedro possessed the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Pearl", "episode": "Episode 54", "chapter": "Chapter 25", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "A towering man, Pearl's ensemble includes two large iron plates covering his front and backside, as well as two small plates with large pearls embedded in them for strong, blunt attacks. When introduced, he claims that he is \"a shield man\", but also \"a dandy man\", referring to the iron plates he wears on his body, as well as his notably handsome face. In the manga, as seen on Volume 8's cover page, Pearl's iron plates have an orange and white design, and his hair is also red, while in the anime, his plates are shining metal gray with black linings, and his hair is black.", "personality": "Pearl appeared to be somewhat cocky, claiming to have never lost a drop of blood in battle, as well as calling himself \"dandy\". He also shares Krieg's belief of using any means to achieve victory, even if it means playing dirty. However, should he see even a drop of his own blood spilled, he goes into a panicked frenzy, possibly suffering from hemophobia or having his perfect record tarnished anger him. Also, despite his arrogance, Pearl acknowledges the superior strength of Gin and Krieg.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the Krieg Pirates' second unit, Pearl has authority over said division, under only Krieg. Befitting his epithet, Pearl is clad in iron plates to serve as his armor which grants him a high-level defense, as well as his gauntlets for damage augmentation. This makes him impervious to bullets and, said by his crew mates, cannonballs. With this, he claimed that he has gone 61 battles without losing a drop of blood, and also boasted about being able to take a battleship's cannon shot uninjured. Although Pearl has iron armor and uses his gauntlets to block his unarmored face, if he is by chance injured, Pearl is noted to start panicking, protecting himself by causing friction sparks to ignite his body with a defensive layer of intensely hot flames, becoming \"Fire Pearl\"; surprisingly, Pearl is not affected by the high heat of the flames that coat his own body. He is able to set people alight with flames in this state. He can also shoot multiple fireballs, composed of pearls that are ignited by his flames. Pearl's attacks all involve bashing and/or crushing his enemies with his hard shields, as well as using his fire to augment his strikes, the latter of which may be more indiscriminate, as he nearly burned down the Baratie, the ship that his crew planned to take as their new flagship. This, coupled with his frenzy from bleeding, caused even Krieg to become worried."},

His upper body is covered with intricate tattoos, green on his chest, and red on his arms. He wears pants that have lighter colored stripes around his waist and on the top of the legs, and standard shoes. During the travel on the Rocketman, he was seen wearing an unbuttoned, brightly colored sleeveless shirt and carried a pair of katanas on his back. After the timeskip his appearance is nearly the same, but his mustache is thinner and straighter and the part of his hair sticking up is bigger and more conical. When he learns about Franky's new bounty, the part of his hair sticking up consists of four small parts. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.

Ace. This shows that Pavlik highly treasures friendship because he charged straight into battle upon orders to save their comrade.

Toward vagrants and outlaws, he drops these pleasantries entirely, and has no qualms about violently ejecting them.

He has sharp and angular, green eyes set under slightly heavy, hairless brow ridges, as well as a pair of small, upward-curving horns on the sides of his head (similar to, but smaller than Ulti's). A tattoo of his name in block capitals (dark-cyan with light-green outlines) frontally occupies his upper body, in a right-to-left tilt upward: the \"P\" being on his right biceps, \"AGE\" across his chest, and \"1\" on his left deltopectoral groove. Like his sister, Page One dons a mask over his lower face up to the nose, split down the middle into a white (right) and black (left) half, as well as a laterally horned bucket hat (matching the horns beneath) that like the mask is bicolored: white on the right and green on the left. Otherwise, for clothes, the man sports a nearly ankle-length cape held closed by a single yellow cord below its standup collar, colored white on its outside and light-purple on its inside, with a darker-purple hem. Under said cape, he wears a white-colored shirt with long, cuffed sleeves, a point collar, and a gray necktie. His hands are kept in gray (black in the manga), tight-fitting gloves that reach below the elbows, mostly hidden by said sleeves. Above his waistline is a green (dark-blue in the manga) abdominal wrap, frontally held together by brown, double-crisscrossed lacing. Below, connected with green suspenders, Page One takes to wearing baggy, knee-length, green pants (a lighter blue tone in the manga). Tucked into them above is a half-skirt piece colored the same, hanging down over the upper backside of his legs, with a brown belt visible that bears a golden skull buckle. The pants are tucked into a high-shafted boots of a similar tone (a darker green in the anime) as the pants.", "personality": "Around peers and superiors, Page One tends to display a rather serious and reserved, if slightly meek, disposition, driven to follow objectives with a single-minded and no-nonsense approach while not rejoining to insults leveled at him by his fellow Tobiroppo. He is usually the first to be exasperated at his sister Ulti's quirky antics, especially so should they devolve into disrespect toward higher authorities, and is flustered by her childish displays of affection for him. Yet, when in combat, Page One shows himself fully confident in his power, if not disposed to arrogance, and has been seen with a wilder, more thuggish side to him. Believing that anyone rebelling against the administration of Wano should be made an example of, he has no qualms about a powerful pirate like him being sent to deal with such a matter. He was willing to use the hunt for a single defiant food vendor in Sanji as an excuse to destroy and devour the contents of multiple unrelated food stands in the Flower Capital, telling their owners to scream for the offender to show himself if they wanted the destruction to cease. Therewhile, the man exhibited a degree of gluttony, gorging on soba noodles from the shops he wrongly attacked and at one point deciding to attack a fruit shop just because he felt like snacking on fruit.

As one of the strongest six Shinuchi, Page One is very formidable in terms of combat ability despite his young age, as indicated by his high bounty of 290,000,000. He was able to hold his own against a Raid Suit-wearing Sanji for some time and, alongside Ulti, effortlessly defeated Nami and Usopp. However, he was utterly no match for someone as strong as Big Mom, who defeated him with a single Haoshoku Haki-infused punch. Page One ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Spinosaurus, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full spinosaurus and a human-spinosaurus hybrid at will. As an Ancient Zoan, he gains a tremendous boost to his physical abilities. He possesses incredible strength in his full Beast Form, particularly in his sharp-fanged jaws and tail, able to effortlessly wreck buildings using either. His hybrid form is also quite powerful; in it, Page One overpowered a kick from a Raid Suit-wearing Sanji and sent the Straw Hat cook crashing through several houses with a swipe of his arm. Gaining tremendous durability, Page One was able to recover quickly from strong attacks dealt to him by Sanji in his Raid Suit and Monkey D. Luffy using his Haki-imbued Gear 3.

His hair is blond and slicked back on his head while wearing a pair of orange goggles on top. These goggles were cracked on the right side for the second half of the Water 7 arc and the duration of the Enies Lobby arc as a result of his fight with Rob Lucci and Kaku. He is quite muscular, and his attire is completed by a yellow T-shirt, with white concentric circles in the middle of it, a belt around his waist with a little bag attached to it, and a pair of loose trousers tucked inside his boots. He's usually seen frowning. In his appearance in the Where They Are Now? cover story, he was seen wearing an elegant, unbuttoned jacket over a cloud-patterned shirt, with a loose tie around the unbuttoned collar, and matching suit trousers.

He apparently enjoys gambling, as he has many debts to pay off and is often pursued by debt-collectors. When he is first introduced, he tries to steal two suitcases full of money from Luffy to pay off his gambling debts. Though he is thwarted by Lucci and pulled back on land by his ear and gives back the suitcases, he asks for 10% of the cash if Luffy really wanted to thank him, shortly before being knocked over the head by Lucci with a hammer.

Aside from his shipwright skills, Paulie possesses formidable physical and fighting capabilities. He has shown to be several times stronger than common humans: he effortlessly slammed many members of the Franky Family one onto another with just two ropes and the sheer strength of his arms, and he also pulled a giant to the ground with a similar method. He can throw ropes against his enemies in a straight line with enough blunt power to defeat them with one blow, and was able to open alone one of the two gigantic wings of Dock 1's door. Last but not least, he managed to slam Luffy around with his rope and actually hurt him, despite his rubber body. He ishighly resistant and resilient, as he took a full beating from CP9 members and was able to stand back up in mere moments; the injuries he suffered apparently healed in a very short period of time. On Enies Lobby, he was pierced from side to side by a member of the Watchdog Unit of the Law and yet managed to fight without consequences for the rest of the story arc. Paulie is also very acrobatic and agile, as he leaped off one of Water 7's high bridges and landed on a Yagara Bull without a scratch. Paulie has a unique fighting style; he makes use of an intricate array of acrobatics combined with rigging techniques that employ a complicated use of ropes that appear from under his sleeves. It is also versatile since the ropes enable him to increase the reach of his attacks - be it long-ranged, mid-ranged, or even melee - and even attack multiple targets at once, giving Paulie an advantage in battle, be it group combat or one-on-one. The amount of rope he carries is immense and measures hundreds, if not thousands of meters, as he was actually able to make a huge, complex rope-work in a split-second to keep not only himself, but also the entire Franky Family, their King Bulls, Oimo, and Kashii from falling into the huge pit in Enies Lobby. The amount of rope that he uses as a weapon and brings with himself all the time never seems to run out, since he has been known to pull out yards upon yards from time to time. When he attacks, the ropes generally snake their way out his sleeve and wrap around the target. He typically weaves his ropes into patterns that help him to either ensnare foes or restrain their movements, making them more vulnerable to incoming attack. Paulie can also use his ropes outside of battle, as seen when he successfully deceived the marines that he had already been captured when in reality, he deliberately tied himself up with his own ropes and was just waiting for the right time to release himself, the Franky Family, and the giants."},
{"name": "Otohime", "episode": "Episode 621", "chapter": "Chapter 540", "year": 2011, "note": "She was first mentioned by Jinbe in Chapter 615.", "appearance": "Unlike her husband and daughter, Otohime was a normal human-sized mermaid. Her golden blonde hair was partially held up in two loops, much like her daughter Shirahoshi only shorter, by an orange headpiece. She also had green eyes (blue in the anime), thick eyelashes, and wore pink lipstick. She was usually seen wearing a very long white kimono with a cream-colored carp-scale design along the hem and a sash around her shoulders that floated behind her head much like her children.", "personality": "Otohime was very open-minded as she tried to promote friendship between fish-men and humans. She stated how despite having different morphology, they share the same sun. She claimed that Fish-Men and merfolk shouldn't judge all humans by the few that come to Fish-Man Island, kidnap and sell them to slavery. Due to her Kenbunshoku Haki abilities, she believed that distance was the closure of a person's heart and so long as distance separates the person's heart from others there will always be a barrier between them and the humans. But this same barrier was not just between humans and themselves, but between their own people also. This is why she preferred to visit the people directly and speak to them face-to-face, rather than have a speech prepared ahead and have it relayed to the people on her behalf, to prevent a distance between the royal family and their subjects. Being extremely compassionate, Otohime was very devoted to the welfare of her people since she disregarded her own injuries (as she was weaker than normal Fish-Men/merfolk) while acting for the greater good, personally taking care of a simple matter of stopping a burglar, despite her subjects claiming that they had it under control. Her devotion made her popular with the Fish-Man Island citizens. She was also very encouraging and influential, as she told a burglar that she believed he could turn his life around, prompting him to turn over a new leaf and surrendering to the authorities. Despite all this, it was not enough to get many citizens to sign her petition for inter-species relationship improvement. Even though she hardly had any success, she remained persistent and would never stop believing in co-existence. She was also very bold and courageous, accompanying a World Noble to the surface in order to prove to her people that the surface shouldn't be feared, despite the Noble that showed extreme cruelty and ungratefulness. She appeared to be very moody, going from being angry, to sorrowful, to hopeful in just a matter of minutes. She was also somewhat compulsive and peculiar, as she thought that a child should never have snot hanging from one nostril, going as far as slapping the said child for it and then apologizing, but that it is perfectly acceptable if snot is hanging from both. However, this did not seem to apply to her own children, at least not Shirahoshi (though she was just a baby at the time). There was one occasion when she was emotionally stressed, she consumed vast amounts of alcohol in sorrow and berated the island over the broadcast radio, all while intoxicated. As part of her immense desire to strengthen the bonds between humanity and fish folks, Otohime was also very merciful and kind, and did not hate anyone despite whatever offense they have made. She further tried to have others to let go of their hatred, believing that it should not be passed onto the next generation; while she understood the Sun Pirates for hating Mjosgard, she tried to persuade them to forgive him and not let the children around inherit such hatred. Even when she was shot by Hody Jones, she did not hate him and pleaded her children to not hate him either. Apparently, Otohime was quite seditious in her youth, as well as seductive.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former queen of the Ryugu Kingdom, Otohime held authority over her country and its subjects. Otohime appeared to have had incredible speed and reflexes since she was able to dodge gunshots and subdue a thief with ease, as well as mermaids being naturally the fastest swimmers. However, her body was weaker than an average person's body as her hand was badly bruised and suffered a complex fracture after slapping the thief. Despite this the thief was visibly harmed, and even with her hands severely injured she continued to slap the thief and defeat him, demonstrating relatively great will and pain tolerance. Otohime was an extremely persuasive orator and diplomat, having frequently made speeches to the Ryugu Kingdom citizens about living in harmony with humans. She could even reform Mjosgard, a World Noble who possessed immense arrogance and cruelty, into becoming a humble and benevolent man. Like Aisa, she was born with Kenbunshoku Haki. Otohime seemingly predicted the paths of bullets fired at her and dodged them (aided with her speed and reflexes) with her eyes closed. She alsouses this ability to understandthe feelings of others, and can use this to get her enemies to change their ways.However, despite this she was killed by a gunshot in the confusion when her petition pages were being burned; she claimed that it was because she was caught off guard since she was so happy that everyone was signing her petitions, causing her to lose concentration."},

As his given name implies, Peachbeard also sports a long handlebar pink mustache which curls upwards at the ends and a long goatee with a slight downward curl. He has some wrinkles around his eyes and mouth and a stitched scar running from his left eye to his left cheekbone. His attire is reminiscent of that of a classic pirate: with a handkerchief and feather hat, a dark jacket hanging from his shoulders, and a simple shirt and trousers.

He sometimes feigns an understanding attitude, as he recognized that it was the fault of the Lulusia Kingdom royalty and the Marines that Lulusia Kingdom was left unprotected, but his only real care is for treasure, as he hit a woman after finding out what treasure the Lulusia Kingdom held. Peachbeard is also very expressive and quick to shock and anger, as he vocally expressed his bewilderment at the presence of four Revolutionary Army commanders on Lulusia Kingdom as well as their personalities and abilities. He is also prone to mockery, as he laughed profusely when the townspeople picked up sticks to fight his crew. Like many other people, he has a distinct laugh: \"Momohahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Peachbeard Pirates, Peachbeard holds full control over the crew. However, he lacks their loyalty, as they swiftly abandoned him upon his defeat and capture. He is not very strong, as although he was able to force Moda a fair distance back by slapping her, she quickly retaliated and knocked him out by hitting his head with a stick after being strengthened by the Kobu Kobu no Mi. Peachbeard wields a cutlass, and has a pistol stashed in his belt, although he has not been seen using either of them. In the anime, he shows enough skill with his sword to defeat a few Marine soldiers with a single strike."},

He does not seem to care about Sabo outside of matters involving the family name. He even told him, almost outright, that one of the reasons behind Sterry's adoption was so that the family could have another child in case Sabo failed the family in the future, as well as stated that a child's happiness should come from pleasing their parents. This shows that he does not have very much faith, if any, in his son's success. However, his constant attempts to reason with Sabo does indicate despite his actions, he wanted Sabo to succeed as a noble, although his ideals gave him the wrong reasons to care about his son's well being.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a noble, he has some influence over the way things are run in the Goa Kingdom and has a considerable amount of wealth to bribe the authorities."},

As Gyukimaru, he is a very large man with a face resembling a mask. He wears a dark kimono, light pants, and a light cape, and carries many weapons on his back. He also wears a very large bead necklace.", "personality": "Onimaru is fiercely protective of the graves of those buried in Ringo, and has tirelessly worked to protect them for almost two decades, enduring multiple injuries in the process but never wavering. Onimaru is very violent against those who try to violate the graves. It was only when Kawamatsu offered Onimaru his arm that the komagitsune let the samurai take the weapons from the graves. As Gyukimaru, he was unwilling to believe Roronoa Zoro's claim that he had rightfully obtained Shusui from Shimotsuki Ryuma. He does not seem to take much interest in activities outside of guarding the graves and stealing weapons from passersby. Onimaru has shown in his Gyukimaru transformation that he is very intelligent and aware of the legends and history of Wano. This is seen as he greatly reveres the legends of Ryuma, and so went to great lengths to return Shusui to his grave, as he left Ringo and went to Ebisu Town near the Flower Capital just to take it back. He is rather pragmatic in battle and always looks for an opening on his opponent, even when they are distracted or caught up by something else altogether. However, he is merciful enough to not attack an opponent who can no longer fight.", "abilities_and_powers": "Onimaru is a skilled thief, being able to successfully steal Shusui from Zoro and make his way halfway across Wano Country at a fast pace. His jaw is quite strong, as he was able to instantly cause considerable injury to Kawamatsu's arm by biting it. He also has considerable endurance, as he stood to protect the graves after being struck by arrows, and in the present day, he was able to withstand a bazooka shot from one of the Beasts Pirates. Onimaru ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Onyudo, an Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full monk yokai and a komagitsune-monk hybrid at will. Onimaru is able to transform into a large humanoid, who is known as Gyukimaru. As Gyukimaru, he is capable of human speech. Befitting his size, Gyukimaru has enormous strength as he could match Zoro's physical power. He also has great speed, able to match Zoro's agility, though in their next match, he was overwhelmed by Zoro, implying he might have had an advantage in the first match because he caught the swordsman off-guard. Gyukimaru has been shown to be extremely skilled in wielding his naginata, able to clash evenly with the powerful swordsman Roronoa Zoro. He has been shown using the handle of the staff to counter Zoro's sword strikes. While acting as Gyukimaru, his main weapon is a very long naginata, which grants him great size and range in addition to cutting power.

His idea for the \"salvation\" of the human race is to eradicate it, and as a guardian of Upper Yard he spent a great deal of time working to kill anyone he encountered. Ohm is extremely arrogant about his abilities, being very proud of his Ordeal of Iron's 0% survival rate. He will speak derisively to people who attempt to challenge him, none moreso than his fellow three priests, and will take any opportunity to boast about his great power.

He, along with the other priests, are stated to be \"unimaginably strong\" by Pagaya, with their prowess below that of only Enel. Ohm frequently uses Milky Dials as well as an Eisen Dial, which generate a substance known as \"Iron Cloud\" that has the toughness and sharpness of iron, but can move freely like normal clouds. With the combination of these Dials and his Mantra, Ohm is extremely powerful in combat and can use his weaponry to take out most opponents with relative ease, including being able to briefly spar equally with Gan Fall and greatly challenge the powerful swordsman Roronoa Zoro in their sparring match. Ohm is also a \"skybreeder\" who is extremely proficient in training animals, as evidenced by his giant dog Holy, whom he has trained in hand-to-hand combat to an exceptionally human-like degree. Holy is a powerful fighter and will fight alongside his master on command, substantially increasing Ohm's threat to opponents. Ohm controlled the Ordeal of Iron against intruders on Upper Yard. It was by far the most effective of the four priests' ordeals, having a 0% survival rate until Roronoa Zoro managed to triumph against it and defeat Ohm. Ohm set up pressure plates on the ground that triggered Milky Dials to instantaneously generate barbed wire made out of Iron Clouds, with the sudden growth of this wire resulting in victims being stabbed. Additionally, Ohm could create a giant cage-like structure to trap opponents known as the White-Barbed Iron Deathmatch, and he took part in the Ordeal by attacking with his sword, leaving just about all of his opponents overwhelmed by constant assault. Ohm is a skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, which is known as \"Mantra\" on the Sky Islands. He is proficient enough with this Haki to see the presences of everyone on Upper Yard, and could keep track of the statuses of his fellow priests and any intruders. In combat, he can easily find opponents attempting to hide from him as well as predict their next actions, allowing him to dodge their attacks and prevent them from dodging his. Ohm's main weapon is the Eisen Whip, a sword whose blade is Iron Cloud generated by an Eisen Dial at the hilt. In addition to taking the form of a typical sword blade, Ohm can freely manipulate the cloud's shape and increase its length and width as he pleases. This, coupled with his advanced Mantra, gives him the ability to strike opponents a great distance away from him, and since the cloud can change shape almost instantaneously and he can foresee his opponents' next moves, he can strike opponents so quickly that very few can dodge him. Ohm has transformed his sword blade to resemble other weapons as it suits him, as well as into other tools like a wall. The hardness of the Iron Cloud makes the Eisen Whip extremely powerful in addition to fast and free-forming; it initially overwhelmed the tremendously strong swordsman Zoro, and when he ultimately managed to deflect it, such an action completely stunned Ohm. It also has enough cutting power to easily shatter through a thick stone wall."},

He is missing his right eye, and his left arm has \"SZ-900\" tattooed on it, \"SZ\" representing \"Special Zombie\" and \"900\" being his zombie classification number.

A blue cloth is stitched across the middle of his stomach; this is actually a curtain that opens up and leads to a compartment located where his digestive system should be.

Apart from the various bandages covering his limbs, Oars wears only a large black loin cloth adorned by three gigantic skulls and a large cross pattern in front strapped onto a rope holding it up.", "personality": "Oars's personality in life is largely unknown, though Hogback implies that he was a ferocious beast hailing from a clan of giants who were especially evil; Oars, in particular, was well known and feared. However, Oars was also very dense, given Chopper's assessment that he ended up dying not from old age or injuries sustained in battle, but by walking around in an extremely cold environment wearing only his loincloth. Due to being implanted with Luffy's shadow, Oars inherited several of Luffy's personality traits, including Luffy's desire to become the Pirate King. Oars is also unable to tell that Usopp and Sogeking are actually one and the same, but thinks Sanji and his badly-drawn bounty poster look exactly alike. He also retains Luffy's excitability, becoming shocked when he learned that the Straw Hats could not complete Pirate Docking Six due to Robin refusing to take part in it, and shares Luffy's carnivorous nature, having been distracted by being told that there was a large pile of meat to his right. Oars also remembered certain things about Luffy's abilities; he found that it was weird that he did not stretch when using Gomu Gomu no Pistol and found stretching to feel familiar when Moria later helped him do so.", "abilities_and_powers": "In life, Oars was an extremely strong beast, having been given the epithet \"Continent Puller\" due to his sheer power; with Luffy's shadow animating him as a zombie, he retains his enormous strength, allowing him to perform feats of incredible strength like destroying enormous chains restraining his body simple by standing up, shattering a large portion of a thick steel freezer with a single punch, easily moving the massive rudder of Thriller Bark by himself, defeating all the General Zombies at once with a barrage of punches, and breaking a tower off its foundation to use as a weapon, while his sheer size and weight grant his attacks enough power to effortlessly destroy large buildings. Despite his massive size, Oars is surprisingly fast, having launched a surprise attack on the General Zombies by quickly leaping into the air before they could restrain him and later avoided several attacks from the Straw Hat Pirates with his speed and reflexes. In addition, his body is incredibly durable; simply disabling his already damaged right arm required multiple powerful and concentrated attacks from the Straw Hat Pirates.However, according to Chopper, even Oars was not resilient enough to withstand extreme cold without proper clothing, which was the cause of his death. Due to having Luffy's shadow within him, Oars can perform some of Luffy's Devil Fruit-based techniques, namely Gomu Gomu no Pistol, Gomu Gomu no Gatling, Gomu Gomu no Kane, Gomu Gomu no Kama (notably, Oars simply sweeps a single arm at his opponent instead of clotheslining them when using this technique due to his size and inability to stretch), Gomu Gomu no Kazan, Gomu Gomu no Muchi, Gomu Gomu no Yari, Gomu Gomu no Ono, Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, Gomu Gomu no Stamp, Gomu Gomu no Rifle, and Gomu Gomu no Bullet; he also has his own technique called Gomu Gomu no Shirimochi (, Gomu Gomu no Shirimochi?, literally meaning \"Rubber Rubber Butt Stomp\"), where he leaps into the air before crushing his opponents with his large rear end. However, Oars cannot stretch his limbs like Luffy does due to not actually possessing the powers of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, though this usually does not matter due to the tremendous reach of his arms. With the aid of Gecko Moria's Kage Kakumei, Oars can stretch his limbs like Luffy does, increasing both the power and range of his attacks, as well as contort his body in ways that Luffy cannot, such as becoming a sphere for the attack Oars Ball (, zu Bru?); despite this, Oars's body still does not possess the other attributes of Luffy's rubbermost notably, he is still susceptible to attacks that Luffy can normally withstand without injury, such as blunt-force blows and lightning. Since Oars is a zombie, he is immune to pain; this allowed him to withstand and get up from the Straw Hat Pirates' attacks time after time with seemingly no limit to his stamina or how much damage he could endure, eventually requiring Luffy to completely shatter his spine. However, he still instinctively flinched when he was harmed until he fully comprehended his immunity to pain. Chopper also points out that since Oars cannot feel pain, he will not know which parts of his body are damaged. Like any living being, if his bones and nerves are badly damaged or destroyed, Oars cannot move."},
{"name": "Oimo", "episode": "Episode 377", "chapter": "Chapter 265", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Oimo is a thickset giant with a flat, pig-like nose and long, flowing orange hair, along with some stubble on his chin. He sports viking attire, with a light green short-sleeved shirt lined in brown-green. He also wears tab suspenders with large gold buttons, and a big pink tunic with brown lace lined on the top with a lighter colored fluff. Under that, he sports green-brown pants with big black boots. He is seen wearing a Roman style helmet, with gold around the edges and red in the middle, with pink frills on the top. He has a big black belt with a gold buckle, and is usually seen with his gargantuan wooden club. Sixty-three years ago, Oimo had less girth and wore a brown hat with flaps on the sides.", "personality": "Oimo has shown himself to be devoted to serving and helping his comrades and allies. Oimo does not take kindly to enemies threatening his friends or mocking him, but his rage can cause him to act rashly, such as when he tried to hit the Franky Family standing on Kashii's body and ended up striking Kashii instead. Oimo was even willing to devote 100 years of his life to working for the World Government just to save his two captains from imprisonment, and when he thought he had failed in this duty, he wept bitterly. After allying with the Franky Family and Galley-La Company, Oimo and Kashii were even willing to risk themselves for them, as shown when they took the brunt of the Buster Call's fire to keep their allies out of harm's way. Oimo is very confident in his power as a giant and has no issue with using excessive force against smaller opponents. He takes the pride and customs of Elbaf extremely seriously, viewing Dorry and Brogy's duel to the death as natural and nearly becoming very angry at Usopp when briefly under the impression that the pirate was mocking the giants' pride. Like Kashii, Oimo does not take kindly to being deceived, and so immediately turned against the World Government after finding out they had lied to put them in service.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a giant from Elbaf and a former member of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Oimo is a very powerful warrior. Together with Kashii, he guarded the main gate to Enies Lobby without fail for 50 years. Oimo and Kashii were able to quickly overwhelm the Franky Family and Galley-La Company when they invaded Enies Lobby, although they were ultimately overpowered by the invaders' strategy and teamwork. After defecting against the World Government, Oimo and Kashii quickly became a fearsome threat against the legions of guards and soldiers in Enies Lobby, although they were eventually subdued by the guards' vast numbers and tied up. Oimo and Kashii have a notable degree of seafaring skill, as they were able to navigate the treacherous New World on their way to find Dorry and Brogy, although they ended up being captured by the Marines. As a giant, Oimo possesses immense physical strength. He and Kashii showed themselves to be vastly superior to the Kairiki Destroyers, a trio of large humans, by defeating each of them with a single attack. When attacking the World Government forces at Enies Lobby, Oimo used his vast frame to his advantage to quickly overpower the opponents around him. Oimo was shown ripping off part of a building with no effort during his rampage, and later he was able to carry the gigantic King Bull Sodom on his shoulder along with many Galley-La and Franky Family members who were on Sodom's back. Oimo possesses a tremendous level of durability. Although he fainted after being rapidly spun around, he very quickly regained consciousness. He then proceeded to be struck in the back by Rocketman, a high-speed runaway train with a front section resembling a drill; he regained consciousness soon after this attack as well, and although the train left a noticeable dent in the skin on his back, he was not shown to have been impaled by it. Later, Oimo was hit by an extremely powerful cannonball barrage from a Buster Call fleet with the firepower to destroy an entire island, but he was shown to be conscious afterwards. Oimo wields a very large wooden club with metal studs. He uses this in conjunction with his natural strength to strike enemies with immense force, and was even able to knock his fellow giant Kashii unconscious after accidentally striking him in the face with the club."},

If time goes by without the bell ringing, Nola will become sullen and even weep out of sadness. Nola will be very friendly to people who ring the bell, acting much like a pet. Being separated from people it cares for will make the snake just as sad and upset as not hearing the bell, and Nola will not forget the people it loses even after centuries have passed. After 400 years of not hearing the sound of the bell, Nola became a vicious predator feared by those who stepped foot on Upper Yard. If Nola saw a human, it would relentlessly pursue them with the intent of consuming them whole. However, when the bell was finally rung at the end of the Skypiea-Shandia war four centuries after the Shandia's arrival, Nola was overjoyed to the point of dancing for multiple days nonstop, and became friendly to the Skypieans and current generation of Shandia.

When the snake slammed headfirst into base of the immensely large Giant Jack at high speed after the beanstalk had been slightly weakened by Zoro, the force was strong enough to slightly tilt it. Despite Nola's size, the snake can move very quickly, making it very difficult for its prey to elude it. Nola's scales are extremely tough and durable, as Wyper was unable to damage it even with multiple blasts of his powerful Burn Bazooka.

She also has a long, thin, and defined nose. In the anime, Robin's skin tone has a slightly darker tan unlike in manga-colored artworks where it is lighter. Robin also resembles her mother greatly, with the exception of her hair color and style as well as having a slightly darker skin tone than her. Robin's limbs are very long, especially her legs, contributing greatly to both her fighting capabilities (given the nature of her powers) and overall height. She has no trademark looks like the others, though her all-purple cowgirl look from when she was first introduced is often associated with her trademark look. Like Nami, Robin seems to be fond of revealing outfits as she is frequently wearing clothing that is either dark in color (often black or purple) or consists of leather (sometimes both). She is also fond of high heels, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Robin sometimes wears a gold arm band with white fringes attached to it with the letter N on it, which stands for her family name. She also had a similar one with BW on it, which stood for Baroque Works, but no longer wears it as she is no longer affiliated with the group. She has also worn an outback hat on numerous occasions. In the Arabasta Arc, she wore a revealing cowgirl outfit consisting of a purple cleavage-exposing corset and matching miniskirt, both with white ornaments hanging from them, and a white fur-lined coat paired with a white cowboy hat and white high-heeled boots. At the end of the arc when she started traveling with the Straw Hats, she wore a more modest buttoned-up long-sleeved lavender shirt with long purple pants and a pair of purple boots. In the Skypiea Arc, along with Nami, Robin changed her outfit into something more appropriate for Angel Beach, switching into a yellow sleeveless shirt and purple pants reaching to her calves (which would not get wet as she walked on the beach), with a simple belt around her waist. She sported her white ornament on her left arm, and not needing footwear on the beach, ventured over to the shore barefoot. She put on purple high-heeled Mary Janes when she required shoes for travelling around the rest of Skypiea, and once the crew began exploring the ruins of Upper Yard, she donned her trademark white cowboy hat, which she still wore for the time being. In the Long Ring Long Land Arc, she wore her purple jacket over a blouse with aquamarine trim, dark blue pants, and matching boots. After being frozen by Kuzan and subsequently thawed out, she changed into more casual clothes to keep warm, consisting of a waist-length black sweatshirt with a dark gray hood, black leggings that reached down to the middle of her thighs, and simple white slippers. In the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arc, she wore a short, black, cleavage-revealing leather dress with long sleeves over what looked like a lighter, white polka-dotted underdress. She also wore black thigh-high-heeled boots. In the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she was seen wearing a tight-fitting, pink t-shirt that has the Galley-La Company emblem at the front and a pair of black trousers. She also wore a pair of white high-heeled shoes. Later, she replaced the T-shirt with a tight, pinstriped purple buttoned sweater and dark high-heeled shoes. In the Thriller Bark Arc, she wore a short garnet dress (purple in the anime) with lace embroidered edges, stockings reaching up to her thighs held up by suspenders, and black high-heeled boots with two lines of buttons on the front. In the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, she wore a black (purple in the anime) outfit consisting of a cowboy hat, a cleavage-revealing sleeveless shirt, with a wide, yellow collar covered with black concentric circle motifs, matching pants reaching down to her calves, and purple high-heeled Mary Janes. She also had a string of round and yellow ornaments that hung loosely from around her waist. While imprisoned on Tequila Wolf, Robin wore a single-piece blue prison jumpsuit, which was left open to reveal her ample bosom. While on Tequila Wolf, Robin's skin tone seemed to slowly lighten in color (possibly due to the cold weather of Tequila Wolf). From the Return to Sabaody Arc to near the end of the Fish-Man Island Arc, Robin's black hair (also lightened in color) has grown longer, which reaches to her lower back, and it is pulled back, so it reveals more of her forehead and ears. After the timeskip, her outfit now is a long salmon sarong skirt that has a design of a green seaweed with red and yellow flowers on the side with ruffles that bares her hips with a partially-zipped short-sleeved navy blue (sometimes purple in manga and some other media) leather vest with a V-neck line and an image of her Devil Fruit or of an actual Chrysanthemum morifolium is printed on the left breast near the shoulder that exposes her stomach, darker pink (sometimes red in other media) high heeled pumps, and a lavender pink backpack. She wears white sunglasses with orange lenses (black in the manga) which she hangs on her forehead and is seen wearing them during the battle with the New Fish-Man Pirates in the Gyoncorde Plaza. Like Nami, Robin's breasts have also grown much larger and rounder, but her appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that her hourglass figure and body curves have become more pronounced. Robin's skin tone seemed to lighten with color to the point of the manga's skin color (possibly due to the time spent training indoors). Unlike the other members, Robin did not grow taller as she remains at 188cm. After the battle for Fish-Man Island, Robin wore a teal, long-sleeved V-neck dress. While exploring the Burning Lands of Punk Hazard during the Punk Hazard Arc with some of her crewmates, Robin removes her dress due to the heat to reveal a floral camisole and black shorts; she later ties the dress around her waist. She also has on very high heels with this outfit and still wears her new trademark sunglasses over her forehead. She later wears a long, spotted winter coat over this while on the Ice Lands of the island, which she took from a female member of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit. During the events in Dressrosa, she wears a very short, black dress. It is low cut, and hence, a large portion of her breasts are visible, as well as her legs and lower thighs. Her costume also includes her sunglasses, black high-heel boots, and a white bell-brimmed hat. She also chooses to wear her hair in a high ponytail. The hat was an extra precaution she used to hide her face along with her sunglasses to avoid being spotted by her enemies on the island, primarily the CP0 agents. She also temporarily disguised herself as one of the grunts in the Donquixote Pirates, borrowing a uniform similar to that of a burglar with a dark long-sleeved turtleneck, dark camouflage pants, boots, gloves, and a unique horned hat (as some of the grunts wore unique headgear). After the events of Dressrosa Arc, she wears a light-colored tank top with the word \"Corrida\" written on it along with dark-colored shorts (pink tank top and purple shorts in the anime). During the Zou Arc, she wears a light purple turtleneck, dark, fuchsia-colored shorts, and cream heels. During the Wano Country Arc, she tied her hair up, wore lipstick, and dressed in a black traditional Geisha outfit. Her second outfit was a purple kimono in white and purple squares patterns. Her third outfit consists of a mostly white kunoichi attire with a purple daffodil pattern, and a dark purple tsuke obi with a large blue bow in the back, as well as a light purple obiage, and a red obijime. She also has a dark flower pattern-covered cloak over her shoulders, and her hair is tied back with a red ribbon. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. During the Egghead Arc, Robin wears a leather jacket that reveals her ample bosom, which is connected by a belt at the bottom of it that wraps around stomach and exposes her midriff, and connects to her panties with 2 lines, along with gloves, an earpiece and a pair of DOM Shoes. The author has also replied to a fan's question asking about Robin's body measurements are as follows:"},

He has two necklaces around his neck, a simple one composed of green beads, and a bigger and more elaborate one, which consists of many red jewels linked together. He wears a glove on his left hand, and bracelets around the wrist. He has an unique hairstyle, with a bald top crossed by three mohawk-like strips.", "personality": "Having undergone the customary training of CP9 agents, he is a calm and collected individual, seen with the casual way he spoke with Franky when they fought. Nonetheless, he is not above displaying his emotions, such as anger at being tricked, fear in the face of inevitable pain, or exasperation in the face of Franky's antics. Additionally, Nero appears to be less hardened than the other agents, as he easily believed Franky's lie when he asked what was behind him, just so that he could sucker punch him. Beneath his calm exterior, he has a measure of arrogance, thinking that knowing four of the six forms of Rokushiki made him a \"superhuman\" that could be in the same league as the other, full-fledged CP9 agents. When Rob Lucci expelled Nero from the group with a death threat, Nero became horrified and made a failed attempt to run away.", "abilities_and_powers": "Nero, while not very strong compared to the other, fully-trained CP9 agents, was still quite intelligent, since he figured out that the attackers on the Puffing Tom would try going along the roofs of the train cars in order to reach the one containing Nico Robin as easily as possible, and he was able to quickly deduce that Franky was vulnerable to attacks aimed at his back. As Nero was still a new recruit, his training incomplete, he only could use four of the six Rokushiki techniques: Soru, Geppo, Kami-e, and Rankyaku. His lack of Tekkai and Shigan made him unable to block powerful strikes and pierce opponents, respectively. To compensate, he evaded enemy strikes carefully with Soru, Geppo, and Kami-e; for offense, along with slashing with Rankyaku, he used a pair of pistols instead of stabbing with his fingers. He was at least skillful enough to have one variation of Rankyaku. Regardless of his creative improvising and analytical nature, his lack of mastery of Rokushiki caused Rob Lucci to claim Nero was \"worthless\" to the unit, leading to Nero's dismissal. To compensate for his lack of Shigan, Nero wielded a pair of derringer flintlocks."},

She, like most of the Kuja islanders, have no knowledge of what men are. Because of this, she, like them, was not easily embarrassed when Luffy was naked and believes all his attributes are common among all men, including the ones given by his Devil Fruit powers.

{"name": "Nekomamushi", "episode": "Episode 809", "chapter": "Chapter 756", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Nekomamushi is a large, yellow feline mink with dark brown stripes, sharp teeth, claws, and a very thick striped tail. He has wild, bushy blonde hair resembling a lion's mane running around his neck and down his back, and there is a scar running from the left side of his forehead down to his cheek. His outfit consists of a large robe decorated with circles, a haramaki around his waist, sandals, a light-colored shirt, and pants. In addition, he frequently smokes a kiseru. Like all the retainers of the Kozuki Family, Nekomamushi bears the family crest somewhere on his body. While being tortured by Jack, he lost his left hand and part of his left forearm due to several members of the Beasts Pirates spearing them off. At some point before his arrival at Onigashima, Nekomamushi replaced his lost hand with a prosthetic double-barreled gun.", "personality": "Nekomamushi takes great pride in his status as one of the Mokomo Dukedom's rulers alongside Inuarashi, having proclaimed the country to be his when the night came during his first encounter with Jack. Unlike his former friend Inuarashi, Nekomamushi is aggressive and merciless; Inuarashi has described him as an \"obstinate and stubborn imbecile\", comparing him to Jack himself, and he is completely willing to damage the historical Mokomo Dukedom while fighting, referring to doing so as a \"minor detail\". Nekomamushi can be stubborn even when not angry, as demonstrated when he kept ignoring Tony Tony Chopper's orders to recuperate in order to have fun. He does not like to be ordered around, having claimed that he went to bed of his own volition rather than on Chopper's orders while being treated by the doctor, and describes himself as a \"freedom-loving man\"; in spite of his bravado, however, he is afraid of needles. Despite his stubborn, sometimes abrasive behavior, Nekomamushi genuinely cares for his friends and fellow minks; he took care of Bepo and the other Heart Pirates when they arrived on Zou and did not expect them to help him defend the Mokomo Dukedom against the Beasts Pirates, though he was impressed when they decided to do so anyway. Additionally, while being tortured by Jack and his men, Nekomamushi convinced the Beasts Pirates to aim their spears at him instead of at his incapacitated fellow minks. He is also firmly loyal and possesses an incredibly strong will, having absolutely refused to reveal that Raizo was on Zou despite extensive torture at the hands of Jack, even when he lost his arm, and was fully willing to risk the kingdom's destruction in order to protect his friend. His loyalty to his allies means that he will treat anyone who tries to harm them viciously, having claimed he will devour any intruders he finds. Nekomamushi has many feline behaviors that can sometimes get the better of him; he likes to lick his paws, play with balls and cat toys, and eat catnip. Unlike most cats, however, he loves taking baths and eating lasagna. Like many others, Nekomamushi has his own unique laugh: \"Goronyanya\". \"Nya\" is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a cat's meow, and \"goro\" may come from \"gorogoro\", the Japanese onomatopoeia for purring.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the former two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Nekomamushi held a large amount of influence over the Mink Tribe, with the highest authority during nighttime. As the Guardian of the Whale Forest and the commander of the Guardians, Nekomamushi had full control over the forest's inhabitants, before he stepped down from his position. Nekomamushi is equal in power to his daytime counterpart and friend Inuarashi, which caused all of their battles to end in stalemates. Nekomamushi fought evenly against Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, before the latter poisoned him with Caesar Clown's Koro gas. Even while Nekomamushi was recovering from severe injuries, Sanji confidently left the protection of his comrades from the Fire Tank Pirates to him, while Capone Bege felt wary of facing him and called him a monster. During the raid on Onigashima, his Sulong-enhanced attacks were capable of injuring the Emperor Kaidou, who had assumed his Beast Form. As a former pirate, Nekomamushi is an able seaman with enough navigational skill to lead a crew formed from his Guardians through the New World. In the anime, Nekomamushi also knows how to make Vivre Cards. Noted as one of the two strongest minks of the Mokomo Dukedom, Nekomamushi possesses immense physical strength, demonstrated when he lifted up Jack, in his Beast Form, before slamming him into a building with enough force to destroy it. His claws are incredibly sharp and powerful, as he instantly beheaded Kurozumi Orochi in his Beast Form and sent Charlotte Perospero flying through a rock formation with a single swipe. Despite his large size, Nekomamushi is also extremely fast and agile; he traveled from the Whale Forest to Kurau City in a matter of seconds and lept high into the air in the Skull Dome. He has astounding levels of vitality as he fought against Jack and his replenishing forces for five days, taking 12-hour intervals to recover, and still managed to survive exposure to the Koro gas and an entire day of torture, which included the loss of his right arm. Even more notably, while all the other minks were immediately weakened and left unable to move by the Koro gas, Nekomamushi retained much of his strength and almost tore apart the chains that bound him to his crucifix, demonstrating an exceptional level of endurance. Like all minks, he can use Electro. It is unknown how much the loss of his hand affects his overall combat abilities, but he managed to clash evenly with a one-legged Inuarashi. He was also able to disarm Kaidou of his kanabo and held his left arm to prevent him from retaliating against the ambush. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Nekomamushi can awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Nekomamushi's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified, allowing him to take out multiple members of the Beast Pirates and completely overwhelm Jack alongside Inuarashi and would have killed him if Kaidou had not intervened. A great testament to his power is that he defeated Charlotte Perospero, a pirate with a bounty of 700.000.000 and one of the strongest members of the Big Mom Pirates, with a single attack. Using this form is risky as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long. However, he can revert to his normal form by blocking his eyes from the moonlight. Nekomamushi has considerable skills in swordsmanship, able to fight on par with Inuarashi when they sparred during their youth. Like Inuarashi, his swordsmanship skill is great enough that he is capable of emulating Oden's signature Oden Two Sword Style, and even using a more personal version known as Oden One Sword Style. Nekomamushi wields a staff resembling a jumonji yari with a fire-shaped blade on each end, which he can channel Electro through. When he arrived at Wano, his lost left hand had been replaced with a double-barreled gun. Nekomamushi possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Neptune", "episode": "Episode 611", "chapter": "Chapter 530", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "Neptune is a giant-sized and muscular coelacanth merman. He has a red nose, small eyes, and long thick orange curly hair (despite his age of seventy) and beard. Both his chest and arms are covered with hair. He is bare-chested and has matching black tattoos on both arms, which looks like a spiral with wavy protrusion designs around it. He wears a gold crown that resembles a tulip with jewels embedded, a golden bracelet on each wrist, and carries a gold trident with an elaborate design. At Otohime's funeral, he wore a large suit. When he and his family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, he wore a dark-colored coat.", "personality": "Neptune seems to be very blunt, as he simply invited the \"Straw Hat humans\" to the Ryugu Palace, instead of being more cordial. He also tends to shout his words out for no reason, including a habit of shouting his own name at random times, being followed by his whale shouting \"Hoe\". Neptune sometimes mispronounces people's names, as he refers to Zoro as \"Zori\". He appears to be easy-going, absent minded, and carefree as he was scolded by his ministers for leaving the castle on a whim on more than one occasion. He has a tendency to finish most of his his sentences with the word \"jamon\". However, he can be serious when the situation demands it, as he intended to capture the Straw Hat Pirates when they were wrongly accused of kidnapping mermaids, though Neptune did not think it was fair to arrest them based on a prediction made by Madam Shyarly, and merely wanted to capture the crew rather than arrest them for a precaution. In addition to being fair, while in his youth he would kill others for revenge, in the present he has shown to be very merciful, as he allowed the human slaves of the New Fish-Man Pirates to leave and let the lower Fish-Man subordinates to do penal work under the watch of the army. He dotes on his only daughter Shirahoshi, and worries about her immensely. He provided several extreme but necessary security measures to protect her from Vander Decken IX, and even attempted to beg the Straw Hats to rush to her aid when he thought that his daughter is in danger. Neptune apparently acknowledges the value of sacrifice, as he decided that he would rather risk his daughter's safety in the hands of strangers than in Decken's captivity. He gets quite upset when he hears that Shirahoshi is upset and gets very emotional when she is in danger as shown when he burst into tears when Shirahoshi was supposedly kidnapped and when Decken went after her. Neptune is also partially perceptive as he correctly guessed that Luffy snuck Shirahoshi out of Hard-Shell Tower by stuffing her inside Megalo, even though everyone else thought this was a bizarre idea. However, he can jump to conclusions when he stopped suspecting Luffy after Vander Decken IX appeared in the palace and quickly accused Decken of kidnapping Shirahoshi. He stated when his wife died, that even if the person who killed his wife was unarmed he would have torn them apart. However, moments later he noted Otohime would not approve of a revenge attack and though he would only have listened to those words because it came from her, he still could not understand why he could not bring himself to tear that person apart. He did not understand how the events led to the people of Fish-Man Island and humans hating each other. He however, wanted to end the cycle of hate between humans, he noted due to his past as a soldier he could not be a candidate for causing such a thing as he would only cause the opposite of his intentions to happen. He understood how the circle continued though, that children who witness darkness only continue the dark path that has caused their problems, but time could heal those scars and pain. Neptune is well aware of the Void Century and poneglyphs, as well as the dangerous potential they pose to the world. Despite doting on his daughter, he knew she is the incarnation of the deadly ancient weapon, Poseidon, and fears of her power having fully awakened. He was also shocked and seemingly slightly frightened that Nico Robin is able to read about Joy Boy in the Sea Forest's poneglyph, but trusted her enough to tell her about the history in detail when she asked. Like many other characters in the series, he appears to have a unique laugh: Hoh hoh hoh hoh.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the king, he has royal authority over the entire Ryugu Kingdom. His lone presence outside the palace is enough to cause a panic. He seems to have an uncommon ability for a merman as he is able to communicate with whales; normally, they can only do so with regular fish. He uses that ability to call his pet whale, Hoe, when he needs him. He has a strong sense of danger. In the anime, he could quickly understand Zoro's strength and refrained his men from taking Zoro head on. He immediately took caution right after the New Fish-Man Pirates took Energy Steroids. He's also fully aware of the existence of Haki as he commented on Otohime's Kenbunshoku Haki skills. As a former veteran soldier himself, Neptune is an extremely powerful warrior, being respected as the \"Great Knight of the Sea\". Even Brook and many Fish-Men acknowledged his strength. However, his strength has declined due to his old age, as he ended up straining his back due to excessive exertion which gave Zoro the upper hand. Neptune's sprained back also rendered him defenseless against the New Fish-Man Pirates when the pain incapacitated him after using one of his more powerful attacks. Neptune has massive strength befitting his size. He could carry around and wield a gigantic trident. It also required that the Strawhat to use metal chains instead of rope to restrain him. He also has vast durability as he withstood a relentless Yabusame attack from Hody to defend his helpless men. Later at the Gyoncorde Plaza, he survived brutal assaults of Uchimizu and Yabusame from Hody, who had gained a monstrous enhancement of physical strength via overdosing on Energy Steroids. He is shown using a technique called \"Merman Combat\". With it, he is capable of manipulating water, grabbing it with his hands as if it were something solid and launching water-based projectile attacks. He carries around a gigantic trident fitting his size, and is presumably proficient in using it, as Brook and many Fish-Men acknowledged his strength. Zoro, however, seemingly stopped one of his attacks with ease, and soon after managed to subdue Neptune and lock him in chains without receiving any visible injuries, although Neptune was taken by surprise and did his back in."},

While Big Mom was amnesiac, he remained quiet, only reawakening when Big Mom regained her memories, saying that the reason he did not say anything up to that point was because he was shy around strangers.

When doing this, Napoleon can freely manipulate the shape of the sword, extending the blade at will or turning into different kinds of blades, including a cutlass, longsword, a seax with a serrated tip, and a gladius. The blades he turns into are extremely powerful, capable of clashing equally with Kaidou's kanabo without sustaining any damage. Out of all the special homies, Napoleon, being a hat/sword, possesses the least amount of mobility. While it can stab and slash independently, with a significant amount of power, as well as hover a bit, it's true power can only be achieved while being wielded by Linlin. This was seen when during the battle with the Worst Generation, when Napoleon was separated from Big Mom and attacked by Killer, he was unable to attack, dodge, defend or counter."},
{"name": "Nefertari Vivi", "episode": "Episode 103", "chapter": "Chapter 62", "year": 1999, "note": "Her real name was revealed by Mr.5 in Chapter 110.", "appearance": "Vivi is a young woman of medium height with long wavy light blue hair, with two locks hanging down, one on either side of her head, which started out at about chin-length but were past her shoulders by her last appearance before the timeskip. According to her father, Vivi holds a strong resemblance to her mother. She most often wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, and brown eyes. She has a slender body but tends to wear less-revealing clothing than Nami and Robin do. Vivi has been seen wearing several different high heeled shoes, including white high heel boots, white high heel sandals, and blue wedges. Though she is a princess, she rarely wore clothing that would suggest her royal status while traveling with the Straw Hats, although she started to do so more regularly after her coming-of-age speech. After the timeskip, she wears her hair down but held back by a clip, and it seems a bit shorter than before. Like most female characters since the timeskip, her hourglass figure has become more pronounced. A notable facet of her appearance is that when she was a member of Baroque Works, she seemed to have been drawn in a slightly different way. While playing the role of Miss Wednesday, she looked older, and her facial features were much more angular. She wore her ponytail in a very high position until she was attacked by Miss Valentine, where a few strands of her hair were slashed off with her hair bead. It was only after her true identity was revealed that she was drawn to look more like a teenage girl, with slightly bigger/rounder facial features and a less shapely body. This was more noticeable in the anime than the manga, as the animators drew her in such a different way that she could almost be mistaken for another character. As a child, she had shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail. During the Reverse Mountain and Whisky Peak Arcs, she wears a shirt with dark blue and white circles (light blue and dark blue stripes in the anime), shorts fastened with a belt, and a white coat. During the Little Garden Arc, she wears a light green long-sleeve shirt with blue lines, white shorts, and white boots. At the beginning of the Drum Island Arc, she exchanges the shirt she wore in Little Garden for a maroon sweatshirt. Once they arrive in a cold climate zone, she begins to wear warm clothing, wearing a white coat with pink shoulder pads, long blue pants, and yellow gloves. During the Arabasta Arc, Vivi had several different outfits: During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she wears a light pink shirt with dark pink lines and figures, a white skirt, and purple high-heeled sandals. Durning the Post-War Arc, she wears a white dress. Two years later, when she attends the Levely, she wears a long-sleeved pink dress, with gold accessories at the waist and arms, a cape, red on the outside and dark blue on the inside, and white high heel pumps. When she arrived at Levely, she took off her cape. During the Egghead Arc, after being taken in by Morgans, she wears clothes lent to her by a female journalist from the World Economy News Paper, consisting of a sleeveless ruffle top, a long skirt and high-heeled sandals.", "personality": "Vivi does not fit the stereotype of a needy and authoritative princess, never demanding any special attention or prioritizing herself above others. In fact, she usually puts the needs of others far above her own and is hesitant to rely on others or ask for help with her own problems. In particular, she places an enormous value on the citizens of her country and the lives of her friends. Vivi's selfless nature could be seen especially when she asked the Straw Hats to make a detour to get medical help for Nami instead of continuing straight to Arabasta, even though she knew her country was in a state of emergency. This selflessness applies to herself as shown when in a precarious of being kidnapped by CP0 and possibly made into a slave, Vivi was more worried for her friend Shirahoshi who was being targeted by a World Noble. She is also extremely brave and determined, going up against powerful enemies for her friends' sake, even when clearly outmatched. Her selflessness and sense of responsibility push her to carry her country's burden. She is slow to anger and quick to forgive but fiercely loyal to her friends, her family, and her country. Because of this loyalty and bravery, she is willing to make virtually any sacrifice, such as when she was willing to allow her feet to be cut off to escape Mr. 3's candle prison. Vivi can stay calm in bad situation and act quickly when she sees a way out. As a member of Arabasta's royal family, she loves her country and is willing to do anything to protect it, even infiltrating a vast criminal organization. She does not mind doing tasks that seem unsuitable for a princess, such as washing dishes. Vivi grew up knowing that she was responsible for the well-being of her country. As such, she developed impressive skills as a diplomat. Even as a child, she understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years: when slapped by Wapol, she apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy to not attack the villagers and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. During arguments, Vivi has a hard time coming up with insults and usually ends up saying something of little offense. She has a habit of giving people nicknames, calling Zoro \"Mr. Bushido\", for example. She also has a habit of biting her bottom lip when she is worried. Despite her kind and earnest nature, she can be deceptive when necessary. At age fourteen, she was able to infiltrate Baroque Works and, over the course of two years, quickly rose to frontier agent status without anybody realizing her true identity. A running gag throughout much of the Arabasta Arc was that Vivi constantly forgot to warn the Straw Hats about various dangers of the desert, such as giant scorpions and lizards, until after they appeared. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji quickly dispatched any threatening creatures but berated her for her inability to remember such things beforehand. Vivi is also self-conscious about her lack of physical strength. After being nearly eaten alive by one Bananawani, she witnessed Luffy and Zoro defeated a group of them easily, causing Vivi to wail to Usopp about not being able to handle even one. After the timeskip, it is shown that her time with the Straw Hats have changed her, as Vivi's adventurous side from her times as a pirate showed itself when she was about to head to Mary Geoise for Levely. She apparently misses her time on the sea, as she felt reminiscent from the breeze from the salty ocean. She even jumped down from the mast of the ship, worrying those around her who were not with her during her time as a pirate. Vivi will not hesitate to stand up for someone whom she just befriended as she spoke out against Charlos' attempt to enslave Shirahoshi. When Neptune expressed his disgust at the World Noble's actions and went on to attack him, saying he would never bring his kind to the surface again, Vivi was brought to tears, saying that not all humans are like the World Nobles. Being fair-minded and honest person, Vivi expressed her dislike of the World Economy News Paper due to their lack of journalistic integrity, especially when the president, Morgans, falsified a story where Luffy took Vegapunk hostage while waging war against the Marines, which Vivi knew Luffy would never do.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a princess, Vivi has a great deal of authority in her country. She has a natural skill in diplomacy. This was clear even as a child, as Vivi understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years during her childhood trip to the Levely. When she was slapped by Wapol, she quickly apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When meeting the Straw Hats, she managed to persuade Zoro and Nami into protecting her from the Baroque Works agents after her cover was blown, and even persuaded Nami against charging her for their protection. When traveling with the Straw Hats, she even showed an impressive, and almost comedic amount of skill in keeping the more childish members of the crew (Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper) as well as Karoo, focused, calm, and motivated during their travels together. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers back and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. In the aftermath of the battle against Baroque Works, Vivi even managed to persuade the royal guards and rebels of her country to ultimately stop fighting and killing one another, effectively ending the needless civil war that was started by Crocodile. Vivi has proven herself to be a very capable spy and has shown great skill in stealth and other clandestine skills as well. This was proven clearly as Vivi was extremely good at moving about undetected, having established herself as a single digit member of Baroque Works for two years before her identity was compromised and she returned to Arabasta completely unnoticed by the citizens. Her actions as a spy were completely unnoticed by the Marines, the World Government, and even the Warlord of the Sea Crocodile for more than two years until her cover was finally blown by Miss All Sunday. Since leaving the Straw Hats, she seems to have managed to maintain her role as a princess, all the while successfully keeping both her past as a Baroque Works agent and a companion of a pirate crew secret from the Marines and the World Government. Despite her lack of combat experience compared to the Straw Hats, Vivi has proven herself more than capable of being able to hold her own in battle. When infiltrating Baroque Works, she held her own within the organization, and quickly rose up the ranks within two years. As a Baroque Works frontier agent, she and her partner surpassed three other pairs in skill, and was experienced as both agents and bounty hunters, as they were the pair tasked with killing Laboon. Her confidence in her own fighting abilities were so great that she even openly tried to attack Roronoa Zoro, till she realized the clear difference in strength between the two of them. Vivi can also make use of Karoo, in spite of his frequent incompetence, to gain more mobility in battle. She was able to hold her own against a group of Billions, although she was eventually overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and had to be saved by Pell. On her own, she has surprising natural agility, often dodging attacks gracefully and almost mindlessly, often appearing surprised after it happens. Her instinct seems to be to tackle her opponent and hold them down, as seen during her confrontations with Luffy and Koza. Her time as a Baroque Works agent also seems to have given her a preference for surprise attacks and ambushes, as seen during her confrontations with Zoro and Crocodile. However, since both her attempts failed, her actual ability in these skills is currently unknown. Vivi is resilient and able to endure a lot of pain, such as a bullet wound to the arm and a skinned knee caused when she fell due to her wedges falling apart, slowing her down momentarily. Her feet are also tough enough that she can go barefoot with ease, as she was able to trek through Alubarna unhindered after her wedges fell apart, run across cobblestone streets without any visible pain, and stand perched steadily atop a narrow ledge on the city's clock tower. After all this, she only suffered minor scrapes and tarnishes to her feet and needed no bandages on them afterwards. After the timeskip, Vivi has seemingly become much more physically agile and resilient, as evidenced by her deftly jumping from a crow's nest hundreds of feet high and landing on her feet in front of her father and guards. In terms of physical strength, she is highly outmatched by other members of the Straw Hat Pirates. This was made very evident when she struggled against a single Bananawani while Luffy and Zoro could defeat a group of them effortlessly. This huge difference in strength briefly made Vivi comically depressed, as she even had trouble with just running from one. Vivi's weapons of choice are her twirling \"Kujakki (Peacock) Slashers,\" which are small, sharp discs attached to her fingers by wires. She is left-handed but capable of dual wielding the slashers. At Arabasta, she started using the longer range Kujakki String Slashers, which carry enough power to behead someone with a single slash. If her Peacock Slashers miss the target, as seen when she was fighting Miss Father's Day and Mr. 7, she can use a special backup move she has dubbed Run Back. This technique has been proven to be extremely useful, as it defeated the two frontier agents of Baroque Works. Before joining the Straw Hats, she had another attack, first seen being used on Zoro: the Miwaku no Memaii Dansu, in which she performs a hypnotic dance utilizing the concentric patterns on her outfit. The effect immobilizes her opponent and creates an opening for her final attack. In the anime (where the design of her outfit is altered), this attack is changed to the Miwaku no Kousui Dansu and relies on a special perfume for effect. She and Mr. 9 briefly wielded bazookas during their attempt to kill Laboon. Vivi was once seen hitting Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji with a large mace, after which the weapon was never seen again. It was replaced with a broom in the anime."},
{"name": "Muret", "episode": "Episode 223", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "Her name was revealed in the Blue databook.", "appearance": "Muret is a young woman with long pink hair tied up in a chignon, with one tuftgoing down. She is wearing a tight-fitting, cleavage revealing yellow outfit with a zipper running down the middle and boots decorated with crosses. She also seems to have a tiny mole or freckle under her left eye.", "personality": "As a member of Bellamy's crew, Muret appears to think highly of Bellamy and Sarquiss' strengths. She has almost no interactions with the crew, but when Nami refused Bellamy's offer to buy her off the Straw Hat Pirates, she had been the first to laugh at her response. After Bellamy's defeat, Muret showed her cowardice, refusing to take action against Luffy even when the Straw Hats took all the gold that Bellamy stole.", "abilities_and_powers": "Muret has not demonstrated much in battle. However, as the Bellamy Pirates' doctor, her talent may lean more on first aid and medical treatment rather than direct confrontation. Also, being the crew's physician, she presumably made the bandage around Bellamy's head that was seen when Doflamingo came to Jayato punish him. It is unknown how advanced her medical skills are."},

He also has a grey mustache. He wears an off-white collared shirt and a polka-dotted tie.", "personality": "Tower has a very good memory, remembering the fighting style used by Kyros and Ricky from many years ago. He has been a regular patron of the colosseum for many years, and loves watching the matches so much that his family left him. Despite this, he remains healthy and in good spirits."},
{"name": "Mummy Mee", "episode": "Episode 79", "chapter": "Chapter 35", "year": 1999, "note": "Her name was revealed in Blue databook.", "appearance": "Mummy Mee is a fair-skinned woman with a long face, long eyelashes, and a pointed chin. She has puffed up purple hair and wears red lipstick and gold earrings. She also wears a fancy purple coat with a fluffy, white fur collar and a yellow-orange button-up shirt with a red dress underneath. In the anime, Mummy Mee has orange hair instead of purple hair, pearl earrings instead of gold earrings and, although the color of her coat was still purple, the fur collar was brown and not white. Her shirt was pink and her dress was yellow, as opposed to the yellow-orange and red colors in the manga, respectively. Furthermore, the anime shows her with two parts of her hair splitting from the center and also shows that she wears purple nail polish. Furthermore, in her initial anime appearance, she had brown hair and the collar of her coat was white and frilly.", "personality": "Mummy Mee is a caring woman as she tried to take care of Nojiko and Nami after finding out that the two little girls had lost their parents. Furthermore, she tried to convince Bell-mre that their orphanage was better suited for caring for the two, which shows that she truly did care for orphans, or otherwise, she would not have tried so hard to convince her."},

He is nervous when talking to Hannyabal, possibly for fear of receiving retaliation from a superior.", "abilities_and_powers": "Muchana possesses some medical experience and seems to know the poisons that the Doku Doku no Mi produces very well."},
{"name": "Nami", "episode": "Episode 8", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "Her name was revealed in Chapter 9.", "appearance": "Nami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Many characters seem to consider her to be an attractive woman.[citation needed] She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mre, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew. Her overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature four-letter words, such as \"Gold\" or \"EVIL\", similar to a shirt that Bell-mre once wore that had \"MACE\" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by her sister, Nojiko. After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head may form into a messy cowlick. She wears a strap around her thigh with three slots in it which she keeps each pole of her bo staff and later the Clima-Tact in. Before the Syrup Village Arc, Nami wore her trademark orange miniskirt with two white rings on each side filled in with orange or brown in their centers and shirts with short sleeves that were long enough to hide her tattoo on her left shoulder that showed that she was a member of the Arlong Pirates. She also had short hair with a particularly curled strand over the left side of her face. During the Romance Dawn Arc to the Syrup Village Arc, Nami's initial trademark look consisted of a white and blue striped shirt, her trademark orange mini-skirt and brown high-heeled boots. During the Baratie Arc, she wore a pink shirt with the letters \"W\" and a lowercase \"B\" in the center in a circle in white. The shirt has white liners and two lines along the sleeves. She also wore her yellow miniskirt, and brown high-heeled boots. During the Arlong Park Arc, Nami wore a green camisole with dark green flower shapes, tight black pants with two yellow rings on the sides, and light orange high-heeled sandals. Nami temporarily put on a glove to hide the fact she had stabbed her hand when pretending to murder Usopp but quit wearing it once the truth was exposed. She also wore Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat for a while before it was later returned to him. After the arc, she wore a plain white shirt with a blue miniskirt with two white rings on the sides. For the first time, she wore sleeveless clothing that exposed her Arlong Pirates tattoo, but later, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, Nami later stabbed her tattoo relentlessly in an attempt to destroy it, until Luffy stopped her by force. She eventually asked Dr. Nako to remove it, but the doctor couldn't erase it entirely, leaving a visible scar; the scar had been caused from both Nami repeatedly wounding herself in the arm and the indelible nature of the tattoo. Nami chose to cover it up by getting a new tattoo which was a cross between a tangerine and a pinwheel, in honor of both Bell-mre and Genzo. Nojiko also gave her a gold bracelet as a keepsake before she departed from her home, which Nami began to wear regularly on her left wrist ever since. During the Loguetown Arc, she wore a plain navy blue, short-sleeved shirt, a dark blue mini-skirt with white rings on the sides, and navy blue high-heeled sandals. During the Warship Island Arc to the Reverse Mountain Arc, she wore a sleeveless baby blue shirt with a light heart in the center with a crisscross design, a dark blue mini-skirt, and her regular light brown high-heeled sandals. She also received a Log Pose from Crocus and began to wear it regularly on her left wrist, the same one with her gold bracelet. During the Whisky Peak Arc, she wore a black shirt with the word \"MODE\" printed in the center in pink with the base in a pink mesh-like design, her regular yellow skirt and her high-heeled sandals. During the Little Garden Arc, she wore a simple, long-sleeved shirt with blue sleeves, her yellow skirt, and her high-heeled sandals. After escaping Mr. 3's Giant Candle Service Set, her shirt was burnt and revealed a black, lacy brassiere underneath. She also wore Sanji's jacket to cover up, before changing on the Merry. During the Drum Island Arc, she wore several outfits. In the beginning, Nami wore a pale blue, short-sleeved cotton sweater, her yellow skirt and high-heeled sandals. While Luffy and Sanji carried her to be treated by Dr. Kureha (she caught a fever in the previous arc), Nami wore a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange and bright yellow (which Luffy later donned). She wore pale blue pajamas while recovering at Dr. Kureha's home, and a light purple blanket with light brown fur lining it when she ventured out of her room. In the end, Nami wore a long, maroon coat with fur on the hood, collar and hem, and maroon high-heeled winter boots. During the Arabasta Arc, she wore white overalls to protect her skin while in the desert, she retired these clothes during her fight with Zala to reveal a dancer like outfit (which Sanji had bought her earlier in the arc) after Paula damaged them. This outfit consisted of a blue and purple halter top with a pink shroud and a long white skirt with the top part blue, Nami later tore the skirt up the side to make it easier for her to run. Finally, Nami wore a long-sleeved white shirt with a brown skirt to match all of these with her normal high heels. During the Jaya Arc, Nami wore a blue and white striped tank top with her usual skirt and high heels. During the first part of the Skypiea Arc, while exploring Angel Beach and Upper Yard, she wore a bikini top that was designed in a cloud pattern colored in blue, light blue and white. She paired her top with maroon trousers and went barefoot. After returning from Upper Yard, she threw on a light yellow short-sleeved shirt over her bikini and put on her orange high-heeled sandals. Sanji notably showed dismay when Nami put on the shirt. She also wore glasses for a small period of time, and upon doing so, tied her hair back in pigtails to keep it out of her eyes, leaving it tied up for the remainder of her return trip to the Upper Yard. Nami eventually changed back out of her shirt when she had to dive into water and stayed in her bikini; Sanji was pleased to see Nami had removed it. She finally changed into a gray, zippered camisole with the word \"EVIL\" imprinted on it in big blue letters, blue cutoff jeans, and a dark gray pair of sandals. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc she wore a black tank top revealing her navel with the word gold on it, she also wore white jeans with two rings on the side, a bracelet, and her regular high heels. During the Water 7 Arc, she sported two outfits. The first one was a dark blue, short-sleeved shirt with a light blue tie that had three rows of black dots decorated diagonally at the end. She complemented her top with a white pleated skirt with golden rings on the sides and dark blue high heel gladiator sandals. After Luffy's fight with Usopp, Nami changed into a violet camisole with the number \"3\" imprinted on it in white, a white pleated mini-skirt, and her default high-heeled sandals. During the Enies Lobby Arc, she wore black high-heeled gladiator sandals, a brown cleavage-revealing blouse that exposes her abdomen with cream-colored liners and a pale blue, pleated mini-skirt. Initially, she also had on a blue denim jacket, but this was later caught and pierced by Kumadori's staff. This caused her to be pinned down, making Nami strip off the jacket and abandon it so she could run away. In the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she wore a yellow mini-dress with a hood and her default orange high-heeled sandals. During the Thriller Bark Arc, she sported many outfits. One of them was a pink, long-sleeved sweater with a white collar, a pleated brown mini-skirt, and brown high-heeled boots. She later wore a strapless, long wedding gown and white high-heeled pumps. She tied her hair into a short ponytail. She seemed to have abandoned the sandals for high-heeled boots as of Chapter 435, but she started using sandals again by the end of the arc. For the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Nami wore an orange shirt with an orange floral pattern, white short shorts, and her high-heeled sandals. Nami's clothes consisted of a pink shirt, jean shorts, and high heels for the Straw Hat's Separation Serial. From the Return to Sabaody Arc through the Fish-Man Island Arc, Nami's hair has grown rather long, which reaches her lower back. A single long hair stand hanging on the left side with bangs still hanging over her forehead. Her breasts have also grown much larger/rounder similar to Nico Robin's, but apart from this, her appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that both her body curves and hourglass figure have become more pronounced. Oddly, Nami's face is now drawn to look younger with her eyes bigger (with the irises now showing), droopier and placed lower on her face; though this may be from the art style evolving. She also has grown slightly taller. After the timeskip, her outfit consists of a revealing green and white bikini halter top, tight low-rider jeans (that expose a bit of her hips and rear), orange high-heeled sandals and a pair of pearl-like earrings that she constantly wears. Ever since arriving to the New World, Nami sports a new belt that is black with a \"\" symbol on it where she can also keep the pieces of her Sorcery Clima-Tact on the right side and puts the belt around her waist when she is fighting seriously against an opponent. Before leaving Fish-Man Island. she changed into a Criminal brand red halter top and tied her hair back in two ponytails behind her with blue bands, as well as removed her belt. The Minister of the Left also gave her a New World Log Pose to replace her old Log Pose, which had become unreliable due to the more unpredictable nature of magnetic fields coming from islands in the New World, which she began to wear henceforth. As the crew left the island Nami decided to unwind, undressed, and took a bath, but upon being interrupted during her bath due to the ship getting caught in a White Storm, she rushed out onto the deck only wearing a light blue hooded zippered sweatshirt over her body, as well as her new Log Pose, gold bracelet, pearl earrings. She also put on slip-on brown sandals; in the anime, she was only shown wearing them very briefly and ended up barefooted, losing her sandals when the Sunny passed through the White Storm. At the start of the Punk Hazard Arc, when they arrived in the New World, Nami changed into a red and yellow Criminal brand bikini top with the same pair of blue jeans, belt, and high-heeled sandals. She also tied her hair back again, and temporarily wore a pink raincoat while in stormy waters. When she reached the cold side of Punk Hazard, Sanji gave her his jacket to stay warm. She was later given a long black double-breasted coat and a set of gloves by Kin'emon using his unnamed Devil Fruit power, but when Sanji was using her body after Trafalgar Law swapped their minds with his Ope Ope no Mi, he took them off to rescue Kin'emon's displaced torso from underwater, and they changed back into rocks. He had the samurai create a new set of winter attire, a tan coat with black fur and gloves. Inside Caesar Clown's lab, she shed the coat and gloves in the warmer conditions, causing them to revert back to rocks. After returning to the Thousand Sunny, she changed into real and more personalized stylish winter clothing and also replaced the clothes which were not suited for the cold, putting on a high-collared black coat with three sets of gold buttons held together by straps, brown gloves, a set of black leggings instead of jeans, and in place of her sandals, a set of calf-high dark brown boots with white fur insulating the boots at the calves. Once the crew had sailed out of Punk Hazard into more pleasant conditions, she wore a pink sleeveless shirt with the word \"HEAT\" on it in red letters with a picture of candy below it, teal and white striped shorts, and her high-heeled sandals. During the Dressrosa Arc, Nami's first outfit consists of a tank top and short shorts. Later, while playing a shogun scene on the Sunny, she wears a bikini top, a necklace with a star pendant, short shorts, and very high heels. After the crew had split up, she changed into a frilled halterneck and a pleated frilled skirt with round studs around the waistline and a small decorative bow in front. She wore her hair back in a ponytail with a scrunchie and kept her pearl earrings and high-heeled sandals. While on Zou, Nami wore a sleeveless fancy purple dress covered in fancy pearls, which is a national treasure of Zou. She still wears her high-heeled sandals, and her hair is loose. When leaving Zou she wore a skirt and shirt with the number \"73\" on it and later a hooded fur coat when the crew was traveling in cold weather. In the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami bought a corset skirt and blouse, making her look like a \"pretzel girl\", which Carrot and Brook liked. Before landing on Whole Cake Island, Nami briefly wore a suit of armor with spears on the back (due to fighting ants all night) but changed out of it instantly. Later on, after her original outfit gets destroyed in a fire, she steals new clothes from an unconscious man lying nearby; blue overalls with very large, puffy pant legs along with a pink sash wrapped around her waist. When meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, she wore a short, backless turtleneck red dress. After escaping Whole Cake Island, she wore a white long sleeve mini dress and donned another belt, similar to the one when arriving the New World, but brown; with her new upgraded Clima-Tact on the side of her waist. In the Wano Country Arc, Nami first wore a dark-colored (light purple in the anime) dress with yellow outlines. She was later given a blue and orange revealing kunoichi outfit by Kin'emon. Her third outfit was a baby blue kimono with a dark-colored (pink in the anime) floral pattern. Her fourth outfit consists of a red kunoichi outfit with a dark-colored (also pink in the anime) floral pattern, completely reminiscent to her first one, with the addition of an armor plate for her midsection, tied with a yellow ribbon, and flower decor on her hair, with her Clima-Tact hidden safely on her, even after the weapon merges with the Homie; Zeus. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. During the Egghead Arc, Nami is shown wearing a bright colored leotard bodysuit with a hood, an earpiece and DOM Shoes. The author has also replied to a fan's question asking about Nami's body measurements are as follows: In Episode 1, she appears wearing a ballroom gown with pink lines, a red necklace and earrings, and a pink bracelet. Then, she appears in a pirate's outfit, with a blue shirt, black pants, a red scarf at the waist, a pirate style black bandana in the head, and two black bracelets. In the Movie 2, she initially appears in a dark pink bikini. After the Trump Pirates stole the Going Merry with her clothes inside, she had to wear a wedding dress from a store. In the Movie 3, she wears a white dress with crisscrossed black lines, and a red belt.

She also wears a gold tiara shaped like three rectangles, gold hoop earrings, a pink sash around her neck, a tiny red-beaded necklace, and two lilac bracelets on her left wrist.

He has a large chestnut on his head which he inherited from his ancestor, Noland. He wears dark-purple tracksuit-pants with a white stripe running along each leg, and a rope around his waist. He does not generally wear a shirt, nor shoes, due to his continuous diving explorations. He is usually seen smoking with a cigarette in his mouth. On his left arm, Cricket has a tattoo of a chestnut with the word \"Maroon\" written across it. Twenty four years ago, his appearance was the same as it was during the Jaya Arc, except he had a short beard on his chin. After the timeskip he now wears a dress shirt leaving it partly open, showing off his chest. He also wears a captain's coat hanging from his shoulders. He has also grown anew, larger beard along his jaw line connected to his sideburns.", "personality": "Cricket is a very determined and somewhat stubborn man. He can be cheerful at some times, however not to the extent of his ancestor. He believes that people should pursue their dreams even when others laugh at it, which he considers romantic and laughs when Luffy told him he wants to go to a Sky Island and believes it to exist, while he himself did not know if it existed or not. Cricket also shows compassion to the Saruyama Alliance, viewing the two captains as his surrogate sons and jumping to their defense against Bellamy. Cricket was carrying a burden about his ancestor Noland, as he was labeled as a liar and was ridiculed by many because of his relation to Noland which resulted him in setting sail as a pirate. When he came across Jaya by chance, the island that Noland supposedly found the city of gold and the island that so many of Cricket's family members failed in finding, he decided to search for it believing it was fate and stated he is not doing it to clear Noland's name but just fulfilling what he believes is his destiny. Eventually, once he discovered that what his ancestor stated about the city of gold existing was true and the story about him was false, He found peace with his ancestor's legacy and move on to continue onto new dreams.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Saruyama Alliance, Cricket commands two large pirate crews through his proteges, Masira and Shoujou. Cricket is a skilled diver, being able to dive at great depths. This skill was apparently inherited from his ancestor, Noland, who also dove to great depths. However because of his constant diving without rest, the activity had taken a toll on his body. Cricket is also a skilled martial artist, being able to outclass Sarquiss in a one-on-one fight and able to keep up in his fight against Sanji before succumbing to decompression sickness. In combat he takes an unusual fighting stance and attacks mainly with kicks. He has great stamina, completing a manual labor right after his ambush by the Bellamy Pirates. These abilities could be attributed to his long career as a pirate, as he is apparently a young veteran from Roger's times. Cricket has access to a flintlock pistol that he attempted to use in his fight against Sanji."},

This feature was passed down to his descendants. He was a well built man who often wore a high-collared black coat, closed by a belt, and an orange scarf. Cricket was right to suggest that he is so far removed from the main family that he bares no resemblance to him at all. While Noland had tanned skin, Cricket is very pale; while he had brown hair, Cricket is blonde; and while Noland had a roundish nose and pleasant face, Cricket has a small pointed nose and a longish face. His legs were covered by striped blue and white pants, and his feet by standard shoes. Hidden under his coat, he had an orange sash adorned with medal-like pendants. He carried around his sword, a katana with a chestnut-shaped handguard and orange and white hilt-bandaging, on his left hip, in an orange scabbard with a green band on it. On the left side of his chest is a large cross-shaped scar. After his execution, Noland's image was distorted over the years due to the shame that was brought to his name. Since then, whenever someone refers to Noland, the image of an ever smiling idiot is the one that commonly comes into mind. This defacing image is the one often drawn by artists in children's books. His nose is shaped like a spork.", "personality": "The Noland who is depicted in the stories is a grinning fool who often went away on long expeditions only to return with stories that seemed unbelievable. In the end as far as the story was concerned, Noland pushed his luck with the bragging of a whole city of gold and it was a tale that cost him dearly, his life. The real Noland was an honest and good man who was brave and cared about people, despite what history remembers him as. He was happy-go-lucky, had a strong determination and was friendly. His only flaw seemed to have been acting without consulting people on things (such as cutting down the Shandia sacred trees), however he only did what he thought was (and usually was) best for people. He did not hesitate for a moment in risking his life to save Mousse and also took it as his duty as an explorer and researcher to eradicate the curse which plagued the inhabitants of old Jaya island. He was also deeply remorseful after learning that the trees which he cut down to save the people of Jaya island were considered to be sacred and asked his crew to leave all the gold behind as a sign of grievance for the crime they committed.", "abilities_and_powers": "Mont Blanc Noland was an exceptional seaman and captain who maintained the utmost respect of his crew and together they made multiple expeditions into the Grand Line, even exploring the New World. While lesser sailors would not return or be completely traumatized by even a single trip, Noland and his crew were able to return safely each time. He was also a skilled botanist and doctor, almost single-handedly curing the Shandia village of the tree plague. All of this is in addition to his intelligence, resourcefulness, and his nature to see through to the heart of things and take action when necessary in order to do what is right. Noland was shown to be extremely strong in combat, both bare handed and with a sword. He was able to single-handedly kill a Sea King underwater in order to feed his crew, while noting that this wasn't his full potential. He was on even terms with his friend Kalgara, who was believed to be the strongest warrior in the history of the Shandia village. He was capable of defeating the huge God Serpent Kashigami in a single sword strike, in the process saving Kalgara's daughter who was about to be sacrificed. This is something that even Zoro and Wyper, fighting together, were unable to do to Nola (who was at the time a similar size to Kashigami) during their battle in Upper Yard. This not only speaks about his monstrous physical strength, but also his sword mastery. Noland was also shown to have superhuman endurance. After being caught in a fissure for several hours (before and after Kalgara found him) he was still able to remain conscious, which led a shocked Kalgara to note his surprise at the fact that he was still alive. Despite the gargantuan weight of the landmass crushing him, he was still able to slightly move it, not enough to free himself, but enough to shock Kalgara by his impressive feat of strength. Noland was also a very skilled diver, diving to such depths and for such long durations that his own crew could not tell if he was still alive or not. Noland had exceptional combat power in the water as he did on the ground, and would frequently dive into the sea to hunt giant fish for provisions. This diving skill was apparently inherited by his descendant, Mont Blanc Cricket. He also possessed exceptional hearing, being able to pick up the extremely faint sound of Shandora's golden bell even in the midst of a storm."},

She usually has a very jovial attitude and dislikes those who are unnecessarily violent. When she sees people paying attention to her, she constantly wonders if it is because they have a crush on her, not knowing why they would do so otherwise. However, she does not seem too fond of others being attracted to her, having been grossed out when Betty jokingly implied that the men of the Peachbeard Pirates had a crush on her.

Donquixote Doflamingo even pictured her as one of the key figures in the Revolutionary Army. The World Government has given her a bounty of 293,000,000, showing how dangerous a threat to them she is. She is a capable fighter as she was able to fight against Admiral Ryokugyu during the latest Levely and managed to get out safely and unharmed. As a giant, Morley possesses tremendous physical strength and a longer lifespan when compared to humans. Because of her size, she is able to move very large sections of the ground with her Devil Fruit power. Morley wields a largeharpoon-trident hybrid, which she uses in conjunction with her Devil Fruit power to move the ground. Morley ate the Oshi Oshi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to push and mold the ground as if it were made of clay. Using this power, she can easily move underground, as well as attack enemies by pushing clumps of ground onto them, as it seems to otherwise maintain its original weight and hardness.

{"name": "Morgan", "episode": "Episode 4", "chapter": "Chapter 2", "year": 1997, "note": "He was first mentioned by Helmeppo in Chapter 3.", "appearance": "Morgan is a notably tall, muscular man with tanned skin, blonde hair, a well-defined face, and a steel jaw etched with the word Mwe (German for \"seagull\"). As his epithet suggests, his right hand has been replaced with a huge steel axe, the handle of which is not only bolted through the bones of his forearm, but sticks out where his elbow should be. Like most Marine officers, he wears a large, ornate overcoat. However, this coat notably lacks the usual \"Justice\" (?) insignia, and is completely sleeveless; it is also worn conventionally, instead of being draped over the shoulders like a cape. His trousers bear a striped pattern reminiscent of Marine Bases and battleships. In peacetime, he can often be seen smoking a cigar. As a no-name Marine, Morgan had a cleft chin similar to his sons (though this apparently developed after his youth), and his arms were both whole and a little less muscular, though he still seemed very well-built. During the attack by Captain Kuro, his arm was maimed and his chin shattered, necessitating his future prosthetics. He wore a standard Marine uniform, which was slashed across the front by Kuros signature Cat Claws. After his defeat and arrest, Morgan was put into a standard striped prisoner's uniform, and shackled around the arms and legs. While he eventually rid himself of the shackles, the prisoner's uniform has remained his last known outfit to date.", "personality": "In his youth, Morgan was a brave, tenacious Marine, willing to defy enemies even on the brink of death. In time, however, his success corrupted him until he became a brutal tyrant obsessed with his personal status and glory above all. As such, Morgan's usual demeanor is similar to that of many pirates: ruling chiefly through terror, quick to threaten execution for the slightest defiance, and utterly convinced of his own infallibility. Such is his narcissism that he considered a statue of himself (funded by taxes coerced from Shells Town's citizens) one of his greatest accomplishments. Following his defeat and arrest, Morgan also displayed enough cunning to successfully escape custody. What motives or goals he may have adopted since are unknown. However, he became lax enough to take a nap while sailing away.", "abilities_and_powers": "Even as a recruit, Morgan was notably tougher than average, surviving an onslaught from Captain Kuro that instantly killed dozens of other Marines (though it should be noted that not finishing him was a deliberate choice on Kuro's part). As Captain of the 153rd, Morgan possessed notably more muscle and bulk, enough to easily lift an average-sized man by the neck, as well as complete authority over an entire base of Marine swordsmen and riflemen. While he lost this authority after his arrest, he still maintained enough strength to burst a set of metal shackles from the inside-out. He also possesses some knowledge of Devil Fruits despite their rarity in the East Blue, immediately identifying them as the source of Monkey D. Luffy's rubber body. Morgan's axe-hand is a completely functional weapon, sharp and sturdy enough to bisect an entire chain-link fence and create small fissures in the ground. Despite its unwieldy appearance, Morgan is able to maneuver it with ease."},

His body is covered in white feathers, and he has a large tail and wings that resemble human arms.

As of yet, his Human and Beast forms have not been shown.", "personality": "Morgans gets excited by major events, looking forward to reporting them as news to the world. He tends to exclaim \"Big News!\" when witnessing a newsworthy event. This trait is the reason for his epithet. In fact, whenever a big scoop would pop up, he would retain his calm and composure just to get it, despite the chaos and danger the opportunity presents. As the President of the World Economy News Paper, Morgans takes utmost pride in his occupation as a journalist and does not tolerate being called otherwise. He is even willing to risk his life on occasion just to take pictures of a newsworthy event. He is not even afraid of incurring an Emperor's wrath upon himself, as seen when he intentionally wrote an article of Big Mom's defeat, knowing full well what consequences that action could do to him. While claiming that he has deep connections with the Germa, he showed no caring concerns for their well-being, as when the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treacherous plot to obliterate Germa's ruling family, Morgans simply found the turn of events to be exciting. He has proven to be an unscrupulous individual, as when Big Mom was dealing with her enemies, Morgans tried to peek into the contents of the Tamatebako and was caught eavesdropping on the events with Du Feld and Stussy. He agreed to create a fake story to cover Stussy's tracks in exchange for seeing the famous sea treasure. He can also be prone to letting his personal biases influence his news stories, as his respect and admiration for Luffy caused him to exaggerate the pirate's accomplishments against Big Mom. Morgans is shown to not care whether anything he publishes in the newspaper is true or not and considers the newspaper a form of entertainment. Morgans has a soft spot for beautiful women, as he was completely captivated by Shirahoshi. This may apply to Vivi as well, as despite the extremely dangerous situation that unfolded at the Levely, Morgans took her in to hide her from the World Government. Morgans has demonstrated impartiality and a commitment to pursuing captivating news stories, regardless of their origin. This was evident when he chose to take in Wapol and Vivi, not out of concern, but just because he was sorely interested in the fact why the two are seeking asylum. Whether he did this out of the goodness of his heart or for his own personal gain, or some mixture of both, remains to be seen. Occasionally, Morgans may incorporate false information and fabrications into his articles to enhance reader engagement. He has a distinct laugh: \"Kuwahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Morgans is in charge of the World Economy News Paper, giving him control over the newspaper and the information it gives to people. He has access to information not available to most people, as demonstrated by his knowledge of Big Mom's recent acquisition of the Tamatebako and of her Soul Pocus technique. Furthermore, as a boss of the Underworld, Morgans has a high degree of power within it. His importance is recognized by Emperor Big Mom, who invited him to a Tea Party. He also has deep bonds with the Germa, and his newspaper incidentally publishes a popular comic strip that features their army as its main antagonists. Morgans does not fight often, but he has considerable combat skills, beating a Cipher Pol agent within seconds. He also possesses great willpower, withstanding a blast of Haoshoku Haki from Big Mom. Morgans ate the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Albatross, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit which allows him to transform into an albatross. However, for unknown reasons, he is incapable of flying."},

These scales are actually his hardened skin, protecting his vital organs from external attacks as an armor. He has a big, round nose with a gold nose ring, cow-esque face, horns, and green spots throughout his body. Besides helping him swim, his fins contain retractable bones sharp enough to act as claws.", "personality": "Like most pirate pets, Momoo is very simpleminded, and spends most of his waking time focused on either food or obeying those he recognizes as superiors. As a carnivore of great size and strength, he has no qualms about eating any humans who approach him. However, he is easily intimidated by those he cannot overpower, and developed a severe phobia of the Straw Hat Pirates in particular after receiving multiple beatings from them, particularly Luffy and Sanji. His behavior has not changed even after two years. After seeing the Straw Hats again during the journey to Fish-Man Island, he quickly fled in terror, but the Caribou Pirates easily forced him to turn back by giving him a lump on the head.", "abilities_and_powers": "Momoo is strong enough to destroy an entire village, as seen with Gosa Village. Momoo (as other sea cows) also has the strength to overturn ships while searching for food. He has a well-developed sense of smell, allowing him to lurk on the bottom of the sea and emerge at once to attack his target without giving them time to react. Due to his gigantic fins, he can swim as fast as 70 km/h (43,5 mps). The hardened skin on his body serve as an armor, protecting him from external attacks. Momoo can also swallow his prey whole. His four stomachs (just as a normal cow has) are full of various bacteria and parasites that actively digest whatever he eats.

{"name": "Monet", "episode": "Episode 657", "chapter": "Chapter 581", "year": 2012, "note": "Her name was revealed in Chapter 662.", "appearance": "As a harpy, she had white feathered wings instead of arms that fade to light green at the edges, talons instead of feet, and a tail. She had the build of an average human, but her long legs made her much taller. She had long, wavy, light green hair and brown eyes. In the anime, her eyes are amber. She was also considered very attractive as several Marines commented on her appearance. She wore a green cropped tank top with \"HAPPY\" written in dark green on the chest and yellow cut-off pants with orange stripes. She had a Baby Den Den Mushi strapped to her belt. She was usually seen wearing glasses while reading, implying she was farsighted. The glasses have circles in a ripple pattern on the lenses, giving the appearance of thick spectacles. In a flashback, she was seen with human limbs, wearing a blue and white striped shirt and blue bloomers, as well as a set of blue heels. When enraged, Monet could transform her body into a large demonic entity with sharp teeth and berserk-like eyes. In the manga, Monet's legs had human skin below the cutoff of her pants until the first joint, while in the anime, her legs had all bird skin below the cutoff of her pants. In SBS Volume 80, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Monet is shown wearing a white tank top, black pants that went down to her knees, and standard glasses.", "personality": "Monet appeared to have a very flippant personality, choosing to only inform Caesar about the disaster unfolding on Punk Hazard, after finding out that the intruders were the Straw Hat Pirates. Despite all of the uproar, she maintained the thrilled smile on her face, implying she found it amusing. Monet was also shown examples of being quite diligent, like how she explained to Caesar how the Straw Hat Pirates' real strength might be above their current bounties, being unsurprised by Luffy breaking through her barrier noting an ordinary pirate could not do so, recognizing that she couldn't defeat Luffy in battle, knowing how to delay him effectively, she also did not believe that she could beat Zoro in a sword fight and instead tried to aim for the weaker targets: Nami, Chopper and Robin. Zoro commented on this, stating it was pitiful she attacked people who could not even defend themselves, due to their lack of Haki. While fighting foes that are more powerful than her, she will use cunning tactics to gain an advantage or attack foes that are weak. If she has control of the situation, she displays a confident demeanor. However, Monet can be overconfident, which results in her underestimating her foes. When fighting against Tashigi, she assumed Zoro would not attack a woman, but this was because Zoro was holding back as he did not take her as a challenging opponent. Monet was also a very calm and level-headed individual, as she rarely got surprised or angry in regard to either situation and always maintained a relaxed demeanor even in the heat of battle. Also, unlike Caesar, she was a much more skillful liar, such as all the children believing her about Caesar's treatments on them to cure illnesses. Despite knowing of Caesar's cruel treatment towards the children and his own underlings, Monet continued to follow him without hesitation (likely due to her mission to watch over him from Doflamingo's order). She could also be rather flirtatious, such as flirting with Law when he returned to the lab and even thinking about a date when he said he needed her. When commented on her looks and being told of her beauty, she bashfully blushed despite the serious situation. She also tried to cover herself with her wings and her knees buckled as well, suggesting she was rather shy to compliments. Monet has been shown to be rather sadistic, seemingly enjoyed the suffering of others such as chuckling at Law's pain from encountering Vergo. She, like Caesar, gave the children the terrible drug, NHC10, with a smile, showing that she was just as ruthless as her master while even knowing of how they will die within five years yet she showed no concern whatsoever. When Mocha was in danger and being chased by the drug enhanced children, Monet showed no concern and even derided her situation when her life was on the line. She expressed no remorse for what was happening to either Mocha or the berserk children, and even mockingly stated that she and Caesar had raised them, giving them a carefree life, despite using them as test subjects. Like Doflamingo, she had a habit of sticking her tongue out in a sadistic manner when she was amused about a predicament or when she attempted to kill someone. Monet could also be terrifying when enraged such as when the Straw Hat Pirates and the Marines tried to stop the kids, Monet was furious at them for attempting to ruin her long, hard work and even justified her actions against the children by claiming that she gave the kids a happy and carefree life. Monet isn't without fear, as when Zoro was charging at her, Monet could not move and was cut in half. Even though his sword was not imbued with Haki, the thought of being killed left her unable to reform properly. Monet had a habit of licking her lips, usually when she got excited, like when she was about to fight Luffy or heard something interesting, such as Luffy being able to use Haoshoku Haki in the anime.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a harpy, Monet had the ability to fly. Her feathers were prehensile enough for her wings to double as hands, as she was seen holding a newspaper with them. Although they made for rather large hands, she was able to do delicate things with them such as turning pages and writing. She could also use her talons to slash foes. Monet seemed to be a good researcher, as she was able to look up information about the Straw Hats in a short amount of time and later inform Caesar about Law's involvements with Luffy from two years ago. She was also quite perceptive, noting that the true strength of the Straw Hat Pirates might be more than what their bounties suggested given their two years of seeming inactivity. Monet was also cunning enough to be able to delay Luffy effectively even though he outclassed her. In direct combat, Monet was capable, being able to fight against Luffy and later Zoro without much difficulty (though she did admit she would not be able to defeat them and was only able to hold them off). With her powers, she was able to overwhelm both Nami and Robin with little effort and even clash with a powerful swordsman such as Zoro (when he was holding back). Her skills were great enough to defeat Tashigi, a Marine Captain, with little effort, and she would have killed her had Zoro not interfered. Monet ate the Yuki Yuki no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit which allowed her to create, control, and transform her body into snow. She had a very high level of control over her powers and her elemental body that are rarely seen among Logia users. She could compress and solidify her snow, allowing her to create durable snow barriers, ice-like snow blades, and strong concussive snow attacks. She could create incredibly durable snow walls or even a multi-layered igloo-like dome. Only Monet herself could pass through the barriers by merging with the snow. By solidifying and hardening her snow feathers, she could use them as ice-like blades that were strong enough to clash with Zoro's Meito swords. She also had the ability to make someone fall asleep and even succumb to hypothermia by hugging her freezing cold body around them, causing their body temperature to lower and leaving them weakened. Monet could give herself the home field advantage by covering the area in a thick layer of snow and generating a blizzard across the battlefield. She could trap her opponents in the thick snow. Additionally, with her ability to merge with the snow, she was able to maneuver around the battlefield at higher-than-normal speed and without her opponent being able to perceive her. This allowed her to deliver sneak attacks. She could even transform herself into a large snow monster with long icicle-like fangs. In this form, her bite was not only strong, but cold enough to freeze and break the afflicted body part. Monet wielded a pair of gigantic ice picks, which she used by holding them with her clawed feet, and was capable of clashing with Zoro, who was an accomplished swordswoman (Though it should be noted that Zoro was holding back). In the anime, they were composed of snow, and reverted back into snow when she was defeated. She could also use her wings as a sword with her \"Snow Sword\" ability against him."},
{"name": "Monkey D. Dragon", "episode": "Episode 100", "chapter": "Chapter 52", "year": 1999, "note": "His full name was revealed by Monkey D. Garp in Chapter 432.", "appearance": "Dragon is a tall middle-aged man with spiky black hair with a widow's peak and a tattoo on the left side of his face, which is colored dark red in the anime and bright red in the manga. He has a bit of stubble on his chin. He is usually dressed in a long green cloak, underneath which he wears the orange garb of a revolutionary. He is most often seen sporting a grin. Only on rare occasions, such as at Roger's execution, has Dragon not been seen smiling. 22 years before the start of the series, at Gol D. Roger's execution, Dragon did not have his tattoo or his stubble on his face. After the timeskip, Dragon's hair has grown slightly longer, reaching down his back past his shoulders.", "personality": "As the leader of the Revolutionary Army, Dragon is dedicated to dismantling the World Government and its corrupt nobility system that allows its World Nobles to oppress lower-class citizens as they please. He considers the corrupt nobility in his homeland of the Goa Kingdom to be the same problem on a smaller scale and was enraged when their self-serving actions caused an innocent noble boy like Sabo to denounce them. When he rescued Sabo the next day from being attacked by a World Noble's ship, Dragon was shown with a powerful glare of anger on his face. Dragon is typically seen with a serious and business-minded disposition and takes care to stay highly informed about the happenings of the world and educate his subordinates about relevant objects and events in current affairs. Dragon is quick to caution his subordinates against celebrating small victories, reminding them of the war they are in and of the World Government's great power. However, he has been shown smiling when reflecting on the changing course of the world, particularly his son Luffy's role in it as a pirate. Dragon is extremely secretive about his personal life and history, as he did not tell anyone in the Revolutionary Army that he was Garp's son or Luffy's father, and once shut down an attempt by Ivankov to ask if he had family out in the world. When the news of his family ties came out following the Summit War of Marineford, Dragon noted that it would help his subordinates to see him as a human for once. Dragon has shown himself to be an empathetic person, particularly to those who are oppressed by the World Government's system. He checked to see if a young Sabo was all right after seeing him be thrown to the ground, and did not hesitate to take his denouncement of the Goa Kingdom's nobles extremely seriously. He cares greatly for the plights of people who are oppressed by the World Government and their member islands, and seeks them out to invite them to join his fight for freedom. He also cares about the members and associates of his army, as shown when he asked Koala if Nico Robin was doing well. When he was under the impression that Portgas D. Ace was Dragon's son, Emporio Ivankov expected that Dragon would go to Marineford to save Ace, showing that Dragon holds love and care towards his family and possibly his son, Luffy, despite not being involved in his childhood. Dragon is very unforgiving to those he consider had done wrong, stating he would not forgive Sabo if he really had killed Nefertari Cobra during the Levely no matter the reason, as killing regular royals is not part of the Revolutionary Army's goals.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Army, Dragon has the greatest authority over a powerful, globally active paramilitary that has risen to become a prominent threat to the expansive, centuries-old World Government in only a few years. Dragon's actions have given him the distinction of being the \"World's Worst Criminal,\" yet he has managed to lead a largely secure existence despite the world's greatest powers being after him. After Luffy tells Emporio Ivankov that Ace is his brother, the okama queen greatly fears the possibility of the World Government warring against Dragon along with Whitebeard. While his individual combat abilities are mostly unknown, he is able to command extremely powerful army officials like his chief-of-staff Sabo and the five commanders, who have all been shown battling and defeating notable pirates and Marines in the Grand Line. When Sengoku told everyone of his relationship with Luffy, most people were stunned, including Gecko Moria of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and members of the Whitebeard Pirates. This reputation alone was enough for Luffy to be marked as a dangerous potential to the future, and for Demaro Black to take advantage of via impersonation. Dragon himself was able to grab Smoker's jitte when the Marine captain was preparing to use it on Luffy, quickly stopping him in his tracks, and despite Dragon's great criminal status, Smoker was not seen making the effort to try and apprehend him. Additionally, Ivankov noted that Luffy's inhuman will to live in Impel Down made sense for a son of Dragon, indicating that Dragon has a similar level of tenacity. While at the Goa Kingdom and Loguetown, strong blasts of wind have occurred in close proximity to Dragon, which have helped him accomplish his objectives in both places. It remains unconfirmed if Dragon was directly responsible for these wind blasts or if he has a power enabling him to create them. Additionally, Dragon was somehow able to reach Sabo's ship as it was sinking far off the coast of Dawn Island and grab him right before he sank without drawing attention from any onlookers."},
{"name": "Monkey D. Luffy", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his nickname \"Straw Hat Luffy\"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. He wears blue shorts with cuffs, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest. Similar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Arabasta) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin. No matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Arabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang on his back from his neck during fights. During his return to Marineford to give a silent prayer, Luffy was briefly shown with four characters written on his right arm spelling 3D2Y, with the 3D crossed out to symbolize that the Straw Hat Pirates should meet up in 2 years (2Y) rather than the 3 days (3D) as planned after fleeing from Bartholomew Kuma. During his journey, Luffy has used the power of his Devil Fruit in creative ways, many of which involve altering his body. The greatest example of his altered appearance is the creation of his Gear transformations which dramatically affect his entire body: After those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the X-shaped scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it. His usual attire is mostly the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open, long-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons, with a yellow sash tied around his waist (somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit). Due to Luffy's increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his foes, after the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity, with varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark straw hat and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear. After the two-year timeskip, Luffy developed another two Gears, with one of them having its own sub-transformations, as well as significantly changing Gear 3: In Movie 3, he wears a red shirt with the number \"01\" in black in the middle. A deer costume with a fur coat and two tree branches for antlers was also momentarily seen. In the G-8 Arc, he infiltrates the kitchens as a Marine cook, wearing a white cook uniform, a blue scarf on his neck, and a white cook hat covering his straw hat."},
{"name": "Monkey D. Garp", "episode": "Episode 92", "chapter": "Chapter 68", "year": 1999, "note": "He is formally introduced in Chapter 432.", "appearance": "Garp is a tall, tanned, broad-chested, muscular old man. He has a beard and a scar over his left eye. In the anime, his eye color is blue, and his hair is gray, whereas in the manga, it is white. Garp and Tsuru are the only two vice admirals to have special shoulder-pads; Garp is golden and blue (black and red in the anime) while Tsuru is purple with white dot whereas the standard color is blue and red. During the Battle of Edd War, Garp's had two black stripes on his epaulettes, and during his appearance at Water 7, it increased to three stripes and by the time of the Marineford War, it increased again to four stripes. The dog mask that Garp initially wore when introduced served to hide his identity as Luffy's grandfather, whose design had appeared in Romance Dawn, Version 2. After their relationship was revealed in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Garp is no longer seen wearing the mask. In his free time or vacation, Garp often wears sandals, a red tropical shirt and light-colored shorts. He sometimes pairs this shirt with black trousers and boots. When visiting Dadan during Luffy's childhood, he sometimes wears his official black suit without wearing his Marine cape. Thirty-eight years ago, Garp's hair was all black and lacked a goatee. He wore a white dress shirt and a red tie. Thirty years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were all black. He wore a dark suit with an orange striped undershirt and a black tie. Twenty-four years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were still black, with sideburns beginning to whiten. He wore a dark double-breasted suit with a white shirt and a red tie. When he was a child and a young man, Garp resembled Luffy, though more muscular than his grandson. As a child, he had light brown hair, wore a tropical button shirt with shorts, and wielded a pipe staff. Garp already had the scar on his left eye in his childhood days. After the timeskip, his appearance has somewhat remained the same though he now wears a dark-colored suit (still white in the anime).", "personality": "Garp is an eccentric but caring man, who is loyal to both his criminal family and the Marine Headquarters, who he has served for decades. He is loud, boisterous, exuberant, and overall acts in a similar manner to his grandson. He has a habit of falling asleep during conversations and can be absent-minded. Luffy's crew noted his apparently hereditary selfishness during Garp's interaction with Luffy in Water 7. Unlike many Marines, Garp does not believe that a person's lineage determines their path. On a similar note, he does not believe that being labeled a criminal necessarily makes someone a bad person. Although Garp wanted his grandsons to become marines, he entrusted their care to a mountain bandit whom he had refused to turn over for prosecution. Garp believes that throwing children into harsh conditions will ultimately make them strong, and has no problem striking children to drive home a point. Despite this, Garp is a supportive person. When Ace asked Garp whether he should have been born, Garp replies that Ace will find the answer if he continues living. When Momousagi mentioned Luffy being targeted by two Emperors, Garp did not express much concern about it. Although Garp will ultimately comply with Marine HQ's most serious orders, he highly values his freedom and family. Often to a point where he bends the rules to accommodate these values. He initially refused to capture Luffy in Water 7 until explicitly ordered to do so. Despite fulfilling his duties, Garp has a Moral Code to follow, which according to Sengoku is the main reason why Garp refused the promotion as an Admiral multiple times, as his code dictates that it is not his duty to protect Celestial Dragons. Additionally, Garp is generally amused by Luffy's exploits as a pirate, and only seriously laments both of his grandsons' choices to become pirates after Ace is captured. He ultimately allowed Luffy to hit him due to valuing his family more than his duty as a Marine during the war at Marineford. He even seemed ready to defend them when Akainu executed Ace and was on the verge of killing Luffy. Like Luffy, Garp is extremely blunt and honest when talking to people as seen when he openly badmouthed Sterry, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, unafraid of the consequences. He considers the Celestial Dragons scumbags and is not afraid of expressing this vocally. The main reason he refused to become an admiral is because he does not want to be their direct subordinate. On one occasion, he also blurted out Monkey D. Dragon's name in front of Luffy, his friends, and his subordinates without any consideration at Water 7. When he realized he should not have said that he just simply laughed it off, asking those who heard to forget about it. Garp believes in the potential of youth and sees it as a Marine's duty to protect the future. This is the first lesson he teaches to Marine recruits, even telling them in a situation where they have to choose between saving a old man and a baby; they should leave the old man behind on the dangerous island and save the baby because the old man doesn't have much time left while the baby and them have a whole future ahead of them. While his fellow Marine instructor told him never to repeat this lesson, Garp stood by it. He would display his commitment to this by launching a rescue mission to save Koby after he was taken to Hachinosu by Blackbeard, declaring Koby the future of the Marines. At the end of the raid, he showed his faith in Koby, Prince Grus and Helmeppo by entrusting them to save the Marine ship from Avalo Pizarro's attack while he stayed behind to allow to them to escape, calling all of them the \"future of the Marines\". When Garp prepares to fight seriously, he often removes his Marine coat or a suit jacket. Like his grandson, Garp is extremely fond of food, especially donuts, rice crackers and meat. Garp has his own laughter style: Bwahaha or Wahaha.", "abilities_and_powers": "Garp is considered a living legend and is one of the strongest marines of all time. In his heyday he was famous for cornering Gol D. Roger many times, as he was one of the very few people capable of fighting the Pirate King. In fact, Roger states that he and Garp had almost killed each other many times throughout their battles. Due to his incredible power and popularity, Garp was offered the rank of admiral several times throughout his life but refused the promotion every time. As a testament to his strength, together with Roger he fought and defeated the Rocks Pirates, one of the strongest pirate crews in history that featured Roger's most formidable rival, Rocks D. Xebec; three future Emperors, Edward Newgate, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou; and other legendary pirates such as Shiki the Golden Lion. This tremendous feat earned Garp the title of Hero of the Marines. His power and reputation are so immense, that Cross Guild has given him a bounty of 3,000,000,000, the same bounty as an Admiral. As another testament to his sheer power, Garp defeated and nearly killed Don Chinjao in the past with a single punch, whose bounty was worth 542,000,000 in his prime and was said to be able to split a continent with a headbutt, this earned him the epithet, Garp the Fist. Chinjao himself said that during that time, all the pirates saw Garp as a \"Devil\" to them. Even at the ripe age of 76, he was shown to be able to easily strike down Marco the Phoenix, Whitebeard's right hand, which was something that both Kizaru and Akainu seemed unable to do. In fact, during the War after Ace's death, Akainu would possibly have been killed by a furious Garp had Sengoku not restrained him. Whereas it took Akainu 10 days to barely defeat Aokiji, Garp was able to easily overpower the latter in moments. During the raid on Hachinosu, he battled his former student, Kuzan, and the other Titanic Captains present thereSanjuan Wolf, Shiryu, Avalo Pizarro, and Vasco Shotall at once and more than hold his own before he was ultimately overwhelmed. Although, this was after the Marines completed their mission to recuse Koby and Garp chose to stay behind to cover their escape. Similarly, when it was revealed worldwide that Luffy is Garp's grandson, Luffy's fame rose based on that fact, as Demaro Black attempted to use that as one of the strong points in his impersonation of Luffy. Charlotte Linlin referenced Garp when Luffy challenged her. He has merits and influence great enough to make even the World Nobles do not dare to get rid of him despite his rebellious personality. Jaygarcia Saturn of the Five Elders remarked how Luffy's record is understandable, being Garp's grandson. As a vice admiral of the Marine Headquarters, Garp has command over all lower ranking soldiers, as seen when he took two of Ripper's subordinates (Koby and Helmeppo) and made them his own subordinates instead due to his higher rank. Also, as a vice admiral, he has the potential to be called upon to be one of five vice admirals leading a fleet of ten battleships during a Buster Call. Being a Marine vice admiral and the commanding officer of the 153rd Marine Branch, Garp possesses leadership skills and is well respected by many among the Marines, having mentored many other prominent figures in the Marines, including former Admiral Kuzan. Garp is also a great teacher, as he was able to make Koby and Helmeppo capable fighters in a short period of time, and he was also selected to be an instructor. He was also the one who trained Luffy and Ace into being strong enough to set sail on their own. After the Summit War of Marineford, Garp now trained the new recruits of young Marines. Kuzan, who was at the time as a cadet who already learned all he could from the official instructors, was able to become the powerful warrior he is today thanks to Garp's tutelage. Garp is one of the strongest Marines, whose physical strength is considered legendary, having fought many powerful pirates including the Rock Pirates and Gol D. Roger himself in his prime. At his best he had monstrous punching power at his disposal, with his epithet, \"Garp the Fist\", attesting to the immense power of his punches. He claimed to have crushed eight mountains during his training to face Chinjao. This is proven when he was able to dent Chinjao's drill head, which was powerful enough to split the immensely hard Ice Continent in two, with relative ease. In his youth and even all the way to old age, he would use retired battleships as punching bags, often doing so every day for years, without using Haki to build up punching power. As a result, he became capable of caving in the armored hulls of those ships with the strength of his fists alone. It is evident Whitebeard respects Garp's strength, as he mentioned him during his talk with Shanks. Even in old age, Garp still remains powerful, being able to launch iron cannonballs like baseballs at higher velocities than if they were fired from a real cannon, break through brick walls and cannon supports with his fists, and carry and throw a giant ball and chain many times bigger than the Thousand Sunny. During the Summit War of Marineford, he struck down and injured a Mythical Zoan user like Marco with a single blow and, in the anime, Garp took down Jesus Burgess, a master fighter with titanic physical strength effortlessly. In conjunction with his tremendous mastery of Haki, Garp's strength becomes monstrous, as he was able to obliterate a portion of a town with a single blow, toss Sanjuan Wolf, a giant with the ability to grow even more enormous clean into the ocean and almost drowned him in the process, and decimate multiple structures and land masses connected to Avalo Pizarro and his Devil Fruit. In addition to his immense physical strength, Garp also has tremendous levels of durability and tolerance to pain, as seen when he was slashed by Captain Morgan's axe hand, only to recover only seconds later, with no obvious pain and apparently oblivious to the fact that he was struck at all. In fact, when informed by one of the Marines that he was nearly killed, he mistook this for one of the men being killed. It was only when he saw what the wound did, he realized what happened, as he fell asleep before being attacked. He was able to get back on his feet after allowing himself to be punched by Luffy in Gear 2 at point-blank range without losing consciousness and was still able to fight the Blackbeard Pirates along with Sengoku. On Hachinosu, Garp took numerous attacks from Kuzan, his former student who went through the same battleship punching training as Garp, and came out with noticeably very little damage from his punches or his ice-based attacks. He was also run through with a sword by Shiryu, but not only did he shrug off the injury and attack Shiryu, but continued to fight a large number of the pirates on the island, including Kuzan and the rest of the Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates, holding them off long enough for the marines and the all the people rescued from the island to successfully escape. Garp is also extremely fast and agile, seemingly disappearing as soon as he starts moving. He managed to bypass all of the Straw Hats in order to get to a sleeping Luffy, with none of them even being able to react until he was already past them. He is also fast enough to grab Kuzan, a former Marine Admiral, by the face and slam him to the ground before he managed to defend himself. He was quick enough to grab two random pirates just to block a flaming attack from Vasco Shot, and even after being stabbed by Shiryu, was able to move around fast enough to travel across the island and land a devastating attack on Avalo Pizarro. As a vice admiral of the Marines, Garp is fully capable of using Haki. and is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Kuzan, Koby and Helmeppo. Garp possesses immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki, which is the rarest form of Haki for those who holds the qualities of a \"king\". Most notably, he is among the small \"handful\" of users who are capable of using the advanced application of \"infusing\" his Haoshoku Haki into parts of his body or objects, as signified by the thin streams of black lightning emanating from his fist. He can also use his Haoshoku Haki defensively, protecting himself from the deep-freezing effects of Kuzan's Ice Ball before breaking out of it with ease. Garp is an immensely skilled and powerful master of Busoshoku Haki. By hardening his fist, Garp became able to counter and even crush Chinjao's Busoshoku Haki-enhanced drill-shaped head 30 years ago, proving his superior mastery compared to Chinjao, who himself is a masterful Busoshoku Haki user in his own right. During the Summit War of Marineford, he managed to punch and hurt Marco, despite the latter being in his regenerative phoenix form. He can also utilize the advanced application of emitting Busoshoku Haki out from his hands, allowing him to attack opponents without making physical contact. Garp is an extremely skilled and experienced user of Kenbunshoku Haki. He could sense that Kuzan was present on Hachinosu and was going to freeze Hibari where other Kenbunshoku Haki users Koby, Helmeppo and Tashigi couldn't sense him. He was able to sense and catch Shiryu's attack when he attempted to attack a distracted Koby, despite the former jailer being invisible. When Koby awakened Kenbunshoku Haki, Dr. Fishbonen recommended that he ask Garp how to master it, suggesting Garp has enough expertise in it to mentor others. Garp throws cannonballs with his bare hands. The cannonballs soar much faster than when fired from a cannon, due to Garp's immense physical strength. He also wields a giant iron ball, mounted on a chain, which dwarfs the size of his own Marine battleship."},

Similarly, he is able to block Hancock's Devil Fruit abilities by stabbing his hand with a knife, using pain to block the lust that consumed the rest of his crew and turned them into stone. Hancock stated that it was his experience that prevented him from being affected by her power. Momonga also leaves Hancock with a warning that even without his men he is still dangerous. Momonga has incredible strength as he was able to easily kill a Sea King which is tough enough to resist gunfire and cannonballs without taking any damage. Momonga is also extremely agile, as shortly after he dived inside the Sea King's stomach through the mouth, he swiftly killed it. He has a strong tolerance to pain as he readily stabbed his own hand to resist the effects of Hancock's petrification powers. Momonga can use at least two of the Rokushiki techniques. During the Summit War of Marineford, he is seen using Soru and Geppo against Monkey D. Luffy. Momonga is a highly proficient and powerfulswordsman, as seen when he could kill a Sea King with his sword from the inside of its belly. He is seen employing swordsmanship with his Rokushiki techniques. In the anime, he could cleanly slice Panz Fry's gigantic soup ladle made of metal and also take down the giant in a single slash. Momonga carries around a katana with a flower-shaped octofoil tsuba and a brown hilt-wrapping, attached to his right hip, which may suggest that he's either left-handed or ambidextrous. He also has a tanto, which he used to inflict pain on himself to prevent himself from getting petrified by Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi. Like all vice admirals, Momonga is capable of using Haki. He possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He was logical to understand that the household was not the only ones in danger, thinking of the well-being of the entire village, and that it would be better to just give Kuro the entire estate and fortune as a negotiation standpoint for sparing their lives (unaware that Kuro required Kaya's death to ensure a smooth transition into a life of peaceful luxury).", "abilities_and_powers": "Though not known to have any combat skill, Merry was durable enough to survive a direct attack from Kuro's Cat Claws. He also possesses some skill as a shipwright, given his designing of the Going Merry. He is known to carry a pistol in defense, and be able to shoot with some accuracy."},

He sports a blue shirt with loose sleeves and ruffled edges under a black vest.

McGuy is a swordsman, although his exact level of ability remains unknown, however it is presumed quite high. His weapon of choice is a saber. He was somehow able to channel electricity through his blade, increasing the damage done; how he accomplishes this has yet to be explained, but it is likely the source for his alias.

He was very concerned for the queen's well-being and was greatly depressed when seeing her meet with little to no success. His failure at safeguarding the contents of the Tamatebako ten years ago was what led him to personally install a bomb within the chest and rigged it to explode the moment anyone tries to open it again.

If someone mocks his writing, he will respond by portraying them in a bad light and leaving their names out of the story. He also seems to be an avid thinker and planner, as shown when he developed and executed a plan to lead a Marine warship battalion into dangerous waters, and later calmly assessed his situation when he was stuck on the Sabaody Ferris wheel with Marine Ensign Isuka.

{"name": "Marshall D. Teach", "episode": "Episode 223", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned in Drum Island in Chapter 133. He is formally introduced in Chapter 234. Most commonly referred to by his epithet Blackbeard.", "appearance": "Teach is an extremely tall man with dark skin, being exactly twice Luffy's (pre-timeskip) height. He has a massive build as his body is round with relatively thin limbs. He has a prominent lipped mouth with several broken or missing teeth (though sometimes he does have a full set, which might be an inconsistency error made by Eiichiro Oda), a pronounced crooked nose and a very large and hairy chest and torso. Long, thick, woolly black hair falls down the back of his neck, underneath a black bandanna, and a small scruffy black beard (hence his epithet) grows around his jawline. As the series progresses, his beard becomes longer and scruffier. At his first appearance in Mock Town, Teach wore an open buttoned white shirt with rolled up sleeves, green trousers with black line patterns, a yellow sash around his waist and classic black swashbuckler boots complete with large bronze buckles. During his raid on Banaro Island, he had added a large black and gold captain's coat over his attire, along with white beads on each wrist as bracelets and rings with gemstones on all of the fingers of both his hands (similar to his predecessor, Crocodile). At the Seven Warlords of the Sea meeting at the Marine Headquarters, he added a pair of necklaces of red as well as golden-yellow and blue beads to his dark orange sash (dark yellow in the anime) and a traditional black tricorne hat over his grey bandana, as well as switching to a red shirt, while wearing his captain's coat like a cape. He also has three flintlocks and a flask tied to his sash around his waist. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords of the Sea as children. Teach is shown wearing a baseball cap with a rolled up long sleeve shirt and green shorts. He is also wearing black curled tip shoes, and unlike his usual cheerful expression, is crying for an unknown reason. After the timeskip, Teach has grown a long beard that he has split into multiple sections, very much like his real-life basis. He also wears golden hoop earrings and the same black tricorne with a yellow bandana with red polka dots. He switches to a light purple shirt with a black captains coat with red linings. He has a red and white feather with a purple flower on the side of his tricorne. He has an orange plume alongside with his coat. He now wears dark blue pants with light blue floral designs on them. He also now dons a pair of sunglasses.", "personality": "Teach's personality seems to be a strange mixture of courage and cowardice, carefulness and recklessness, and intelligence and stupidity. While at times his character appears strong and fearsome, like he has full control of a situation, in others he will seem weak and ridiculous, struggling in ways that are unbecoming of a pirate of his stature. All those contrasting elements reinforce the idea that Teach is rather unpredictable and somewhat of an enigma, making him similar to series' protagonist Monkey D. Luffy to a great extent. It is worth noting that Teach was a rather gloomy and serious individual in his childhood, back when he was nothing more than an orphaned pirate apprentice, unlike his more outgoing and expressive adult self. In general, Teach is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a pirate within the series, showing various degrees of greed, dishonesty, brutality, opportunism and cunning. This is a point Teach has in common with his crewmates for the most part, as they are known for being equally rowdy and violent. Having wild personalities under his command, however, does not bother Teach in anyway, as he believes that a pirate crew is primarily defined by its members being in sync about their goals and agendas, with relationships among personnel being a secondary concern. This means that Teach is willing to welcome in anyone who he thinks could assist him in achieving his objectives, whether they are infamous criminals from Impel Down, which is the case for half of his Titanic Captains, former warlords, like Gecko Moria, or even former Marines, such as Kuzan. Like many other characters, Teach has a unique laugh: \"Zehahahahahaha!\". This laugh is not present in the English dub until the Duel on Banaro Island. Teach is most well-known for his treacherous, long-term plans, having lied and deceived various organizations in order to reach the top of the pirate world. As stated by Shanks, Teach is very patient and careful, choosing to lurk in the shadows until the perfect opportunity presents itself, at which point he will quickly act to capitalize on whatever he has set his sights on. As an example, Teach as a child joined the Whitebeard Pirates to find the Yami Yami no Mi, killing a crewmate in cold blood despite having spent two decades aboard the ship. Later, he deceived the Marines by joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea in an elaborate and convoluted fashion for the sole reason of gaining access to Impel Down in order to find new, powerful crewmates. Though he betrayed the Whitebeard Pirates, Teach does consider the crew he himself formed as comrades to an extent, which is made evident when he was willing to make a trade with the Marines for a battleship big enough to hold all of them comfortably for the sake of one crew member, Sanjuan Wolf. Despite his obvious malevolent nature, he can also put up a front of compassion, care, show sympathy and empathy towards his crew's well-being and is willing to take assaults intended for them. However, this apparent kindness does not eclipse his lust for power, as he would have no qualms in sacrificing anyone of his crew in order to save his own skin or obtain a powerful Devil Fruit. In addition, Teach does not care about any allies sailing under his flag, which is in contrast to most Emperors, who tend to retaliate when their subordinates get attacked. Teach is an ambitious, power-hungry man who will bide his time to get whatever he needs in order to become stronger. Having a major interest in Devil Fruits, Teach believes that their pros heavily outweigh their cons. As such, he is constantly on the lookout for powerful abilities to steal for himself and his crew, with this ability hunting routine being the backbone of his rule as one of the Four Emperors. Teach also seeks to become a king, even attempting to negotiate with the World Government to make his homebase of Hachinosu an official nation. Teach, like others who carry the Will of D., has a strong belief in fate and the dreams of men, but unlike the others, is the only one who truly seems to take it to heart. He shares several attributes with Luffy, including having a voracious appetite, a carefree attitude and a love for partying, as well as a competitive and reckless nature to the point of persevering even if there may be grave consequences, and huge ambitions to follow his dream of finding the One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Despite that, there is a great contrast between him and Luffy: primarily, Teach fears death whereas other D. carriers embrace it if it comes. Furthermore, when backed into a corner, Teach has shown himself to be a coward: when being held at chokepoint by Whitebeard, he pathetically begged for mercy, calling him \"Pops\" and reminding Whitebeard that he was his \"son\" and that he could never kill one of his own \"family\". Just before his death, Whitebeard cryptically noted that Teach was not the one Roger had been waiting for and dismissed Teach as being incapable of continuing Roger's legacy. Perhaps because of his strong belief in fate, Teach is highly amoral. He believes that there is no inherent \"good\" nor \"evil\" in the world, jeeringly mocking anyone who expresses such belief. His nihilistic tendencies are in line with the power of the Yami Yami no Mi he possesses, which is said to reduce everything to \"nothingness\". During his raid on Impel Down, he stated that his plans have not gone exactly as expected, but is willing to take these surprises in stride and adapt his plans to whatever new circumstance he stumbles into. Teach is often very calm, composed, relaxed, easygoing, cheerful, and free-spirited, being often politely sarcastic and mocking towards those around him. He does not seem to hold resentment towards those who wrong him or when a disaster befalls his crew, taking things in stride while laughing in amusement. He is also fond of relaxing and having some leisure every now and then, believing that the pirate life should be fun. Teach is overconfident and tends to converse and/or taunt his opponents in the middle of battle, having done this in every confrontation he has been depicted in and something Whitebeard once pointed out as a weakness of his. This arrogance often translates into consequences, as he almost always suffers a heavy, painful attack while his guard is down. Since having acquired two Devil Fruit powers, Teach has developed a severe superiority complex, believing himself to be truly invincible and the strongest of them all. Despite his arrogance, Teach does show a sense of caution, and will avoid fighting opponents he views as highly troublesome.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Four Emperors and one of the members of the Worst Generation, Teach is one of the most powerful pirates in the world. Even before becoming an Emperor, Teach was an immensely powerful pirate, even for a former member of the Whitebeard Pirates and Seven Warlords of the Sea. At some point in his life, Teach once fought Shanks and gave him the scars on his left eye, with Shanks admitting that the injury did not occur because of carelessness. Their battle led Shanks to cautiously recognize Teach as an extremely dangerous menace. Ace once stated that Teach could have become a commander when he was recommended for the position. The most remarkable thing in these two feats is that Teach had not yet eaten a Devil Fruit. After the Summit War of Marineford, the Five Elders believed that Teach had a one-step lead to usurp the position of Emperor that Whitebeard once held, which eventually came to fruition. During the timeskip, he gained mass notoriety with his bounty being set at 2,247,600,000, showing how dangerous he had become. For unknown reasons, it was later raised to 3,996,000,000, making his bounty the second highest out of the current Emperors and the highest among the former Warlords of the Sea and members of the Worst Generation. He easily defeated his fellow ex-Warlord, Boa Hancock, and even Silvers Rayleigh, the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\", confessed that he would stand no chance against Teach due to his elderly age. He managed to defeat Trafalgar D. Water Law whose bounty is worth 3,000,000,000 and one of the two pirates responsible for defeating former Emperor Big Mom. One of the most prominent feats that showcase Teach's incredible power were displayed by him defeating three division commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates: Thatch, Portgas D. Ace, and later during the Payback War, Marco, the new captain of the Whitebeard Pirates. After the timeskip, he and his crew fought against the Revolutionary Army and destroyed their headquarters on Baltigo, before briefly clashing against the Marines and the Cipher Pol and eventually fleeing the place. Teach has shown himself to be an expert planner and a master at orchestrating manipulative schemes provided he has time to prepare; he waited two decades aboard the Moby Dick with the Whitebeard Pirates and even integrated with the crew dynamic solely to increase his opportunities of obtaining the Yami Yami no Mi (and also recruited some future members of his own crew during this time, indicating great charisma and leadership skills even as a regular crewmate). He also went to capture Monkey D. Luffy to guarantee an offer for the vacant position of the Seven Warlords of the Sea by the World Government, which in turn was simply sought for free access through the Gates of Justice into the notoriously impenetrable Impel Down to recruit mighty Level Six prisoners to strengthen his crew. This scheme completely deceived both Sengoku and Tsuru, the two greatest strategic masterminds of the Marines, with Sengoku realizing Teach's true intentions only after the Blackbeard Pirates had appeared in Marineford. Marco also suggested Teach had already made plans to steal the Gura Gura no Mi, from being on the crew for so long. Instead of taking Whitebeard head-on to steal his Devil Fruit, Teach effectively manipulated Whitebeard and the entire military force of the Marines, including the Admirals Akainu, Aokiji, and Kizaru, into fighting each other during the former's attempt to rescue Ace. Eventually, Whitebeard became fatally injured and weakened enough for Teach and his crew to brutally overpower and ultimately kill Whitebeard to steal the Gura Gura no Mi, becoming the first person to wield two Devil Fruit powers. When confronted by Shanks and his crew, Teach instead had his crew retreat as he deemed that it was not the right time to fight them, which showed a great sense of caution. This side of him was seen again when he chose to flee from Marine Admiral Akainu. Later, in an attempt to steal the Road Poneglyph rubbings now that both Kaidou and Big Mom are gone, Teach set a trap for one of the three pirate crews leaving Wano Country, ambushing them at Winner Island. Following his victory over the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, Teach used his previous knowledge of the latter's territory to conquer most of it, becoming one of the Four Emperors. However, for all his combat prowess and intellect, Teach can be overconfident and careless, as noted by Whitebeard. He has a habit of concentrating too much on conversations with his opponents while fighting them, letting his guard down in the process, a weakness he has demonstrated in his battles against Whitebeard, Luffy, Ace, Magellan, and Law. This usually results in him suffering critical injuries. In fact, if not for Shiryu's help, Teach and his entire crew would have been killed by Magellan's poison. Teach has an immense amount of superhuman endurance and durability. During his fight with Ace, he was engulfed in flames and pierced in the chest by two fire spears, but after putting out the flames, he was able to shake off the impact of the attacks. Another indication of his sheer endurance is shown when he took a Jet Pistol from an enraged Luffy, and was hit by one of Sengoku's shockwaves in his Daibutsu form only to come out with minor injuries both times. Teach also shows an incredible tolerance to pain as, despite his Devil Fruit greatly amplifying the pain he receives, this never stops him for long, demonstrated when he took a point-blank quake bubble attack from Whitebeard to his head and neck without losing consciousness. He shrugged off a kick to the head from Supernova Jewelry Bonney, took a direct slash from Whitebeard's bisento without suffering any lasting damage, and quickly recovered after having his insides fried by Law's Shock Wille. According to Marco, Teach has a unique body structure that is different from other humans, which could even explain how he was able to possess two Devil Fruits, while any individual would have normally ended up dying. This is further shown when Buggy stated that Teach did not need to sleep like other people. It is rumored that Teach has never slept once in his whole life, which shows off his tremendous stamina. Teach also possesses tremendous physical strength, even for his comparable size, as demonstrated when he seriously injured Luffy and Ace, both of whom are exceptionally durable, with just one hit, sending them crashing back with incredible force and across great distances. He was able to stop an enraged Whitebeard's quake attack with his own physical strength and with the help of his Kurouzu technique. Through an unknown method, Teach became the first and so far, only known person to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits at the same time. Marco speculated that this was possible due to an unstated peculiarity unique to Teach himself, having to do with an \"atypical body structure\" of some sort. He also pointed out that the other Whitebeard Pirates should be aware of this fact. With the power of darkness (the Yami Yami no Mi), which \"reduces anything to nothingness\", and the power of earthquakes (the Gura Gura no Mi), which \"brings destruction to everything\", Teach claimed himself to be truly invincible and the strongest of them all. Teach has since attempted to acquire other additional Devil Fruits such as Boa Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi and later Trafalgar D. Water Law's Ope Ope no Mi, though it is not known if he has acquired any more abilities yet or how many he has in total. Teach ate the Yami Yami no Mi, a unique Logia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create, control, and transform his body into darkness. The darkness appears reminiscent of a fiery black smoke while also bearing a resemblance to a liquid. Unlike a normal Logia user, Teach cannot turn intangible; in fact, any damage he takes will actually hurt worse than normal. Teach has an infinite amount of space inside of his body made of darkness. The darkness has strong properties of gravity and absorption. The darkness has the power to pull things in, much like a black hole. Even light itself cannot escape. Furthermore, the gravity is so strong that it can completely crush anything in its path. Once something has been pulled in, it can be absorbed into the darkness, where it will be trapped until Teach himself decides to release it. It is described as a void which devours everything and returns all to nothingness. The most frightening power of the fruit is that it allows Teach to absorb/nullify other people's Devil Fruit powers. So long as Teach maintains physical contact with the other Devil Fruit user, it is as if the victim never ate their Devil Fruit at all. Teach, through currently unknown means, stole the power of the Gura Gura no Mi from the dead body of its previous user, Whitebeard. The Gura Gura no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gives him the ability to cause earthquakes and generate powerful shockwaves. It is considered to be the strongest power of the Paramecia class, in addition, it is said that it has the power to destroy the entire world. He has the power to send incredibly powerful shockwaves through the air, creating cracks in the air itself in the process. By striking at the general area with his quake powers, he can cause large earthquakes. His quakes cause serious damage and alterations to the surrounding landscape and are capable of destroying buildings. He can also \"grab\" the surrounding area and literally tilt it, he can even do this with not just an entire island, but also the surrounding sea's. He unknowingly caused a tsunami at a nearby island when he first tried this. In the anime, he has also displayed the ability to use his shockwaves defensively, as their vast raw power can easily stop incoming attacks, even from the Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit power of the then Fleet Admiral, Sengoku. Upon initially obtaining the power, he did not have great control over it. After the timeskip, he seems to have more control of the power, as he casually created an earthquake with no effort. Teach is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. By hardening his arm, he was able to defend himself against S-Hawk's sword slash, which could cut Amazon Lily's large mountain in half. Teach is a highly skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki. As he was able to sense that Luffy's bounty of 30,000,000 was too low compared to his strength, and during his raid on Impel Down he was able to sense that Luffy's Haki had improved since meeting him in Jaya. Teach has occasionally been shown using claw weapons, one of which he favored since his youth days. It is very likely that this was the weapon he used to give Shanks his facial scars. When the Whitebeard Pirates started protecting Fish-Man Island, he was seen with longer metal claws in one hand. He has yet to been seen wielding a claw weapon in the present day, however. Teach used a flintlock pistol when dealing the deathblow to Whitebeard along with the other Blackbeard Pirates, and also has three pistols tied in his sash. His accuracy with them is not completely shown, as he was only seen emptying his ammunition into Whitebeard at point-blank range, yet Whitebeard was still briefly alive after he had finished shooting."},

Like her fellow Kuja, she dresses in a revealing bikini top and miniskirt made out of animal skin that greatly show off her cleavage and long legs, and a white cape that seems to resemble a Marine jacket. She keeps her snake (which almost all Kuja women seem to have) who is black and green striped wrapped around her waist at most times. She is also known to wear some type of black and white striped legging similar to a stocking on her right leg, along with high-heeled boots.", "personality": "Although it is forbidden to have men on the Amazon Lily, Marguerite seems to have developed an interest in them ever since seeing Luffy. She also seems to have developed an interest in Luffy's \"Kintama\" (a Japanese slang term for the male testicle which literally translates to \"Golden ball(s)\"), wanting Luffy to take them off, so she could have a look at them. This is mostly due to her misunderstanding and navet towards men, taking everything Luffy said as literal. She deems men as \"useless\" based on the impressions left by Luffy, but at the same time admitted that she risked becoming attached to him if she stayed with him for too long, resulting in attacking him as a way of stopping herself. Like the rest of the Kuja tribe, she eventually begins to care for and respect Luffy during the Amazon Lily Arc. She also seems to admire her leader, Boa Hancock, calling her \"the most beautiful woman in the world\", and seems to hold no grudge against Hancock for petrifying her. Marguerite is very honest, shown when she tried to take the full blame for Luffy's presence on Amazon Lily, prompting Sweet Pea and Aphelandra to also try to take the blame with her.", "abilities_and_powers": "Marguerite appears to be a talented seamstress, as she was able to completely replicate Luffy's tattered vest and shorts, and even added a floral pattern and frills to his vest, much to his dismay. She also knows how to swim, as proven when she saved Luffy from drowning. Another note is that Amazon Lily is located in the Calm Belt where Sea Kings breed and so the sea around the island is full of Sea Kings, yet she jumped in to save Luffy despite this. She was seen accompanying Boa Hancock on the Kuja pirate ship after the two-year timeskip, indicating that she has become strong enough to become part of the crew, since only the strongest warriors are allowed on the ship. As with most of the other Kuja warriors, Marguerite uses a snake that can morph into a bow to launch arrows at her target. She imbues Busoshoku Haki into the arrows to increase their destructive powers, being able to pierce through trees with ease. While threatening Luffy to stay away from her, she held a dagger against him. Like all the members of the Kuja tribe, Marguerite possesses Haki, a manifestation of willpower of sorts. She can channel Busoshoku Haki through her arrows, though she is unaware of its use in suppressing Devil Fruits. This puts her above most other characters seen in the series as Haki is not a widely used ability. After the timeskip, Marguerite has seemingly become a member of the Kuja pirate crew and thus she may have improved her abilities to use Haki."},

During the Ohara Incident, he was courteous to Clover, acknowledging the scholar's achievements and justifying the danger of reviving the ancient weapons. At the time of ordering the killing of scholars, Mars was seriously embarrassed when he gave that order. He appears to view the Nefertari Family's rejection of life on Mary Geoise harshly, as he stated that such an action makes them traitors. He will obey any order given by Imu without question, as he views Imu to be a \"creator\" who alone has the power to shape the course of the world. Mars has been shown to be extremely callous, as he had no issue with annihilating a highly populated country and justified it because its populace had started to show signs of rebellion. While other Elders have occasionally struggled with their composure in the wake of massive threats, Mars has always been shown with a calm and stoic demeanor. He seems to keep profiles on people, allowing him to be discerning when discussing them, as he knew that Shanks' personality made his contact with Whitebeard less threatening. He also knew that Blackbeard's past would give him a great advantage in replacing Whitebeard as an Emperor, and wanted to know the connection between Luffy and Rayleigh.

As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is Imu. Mars has an ability that allows him to transform into a giant bird-like creature, it also has a ring around it.

This trait was fully confirmed by Kabu, who stated that Mansherry is really kind to everyone. The reason for Leo's misinterpretation is that Mansherry has a huge crush on him, as seen when she reacted happily when he saved her, calling him a knight in shining armor and even blushing when he caught her. However, this did not stop her from punching Leo after he bluntly remarked that she had gained weight; Mansherry shows a typical tsundere attitude toward Leo alone.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a dwarf, she is incredibly fast and much stronger than her size would suggest.

Mansherry ate the Chiyu Chiyu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gives her the ability to instantly heal any living being's injury. Mansherry can use her power in several different ways, including her tears. This was shown to be used against her will when Giolla made her cry in an attempt to heal defeated members of the Donquixote Pirates.

He wears an open purple jacket and a light blue sash adorned with an elaborate golden-yellow belt around his waist. He has dark gray knee-long pants and black sandals, and on his left leg he wears what appears to be some sort of straw decoration, in a similar fashion to Arlong. While his chest was bare in his initial appearance, in his subsequent appearances he has the cross and crescent moon mustache symbol that resembles a black silhouette of Whitebeard's Jolly Roger tattooed on it. Robin and Luffy believe that Marco's head looks like a pineapple. Initially in the anime, Marco was given a generic crew member look of a black-haired man with pale skin and different clothes. When he later became more formally recognized in the story, his appearance was changed to what is depicted in the manga, along with his light purple jacket, his black pants and his dark red tattoo. Later, starting with Opening 13 \"One Day\", he was given another color scheme. Once again, his jacket was recolored in a much brighter purple, his pants were made dark blue, his tattoo blue and his skin a little brighter. Marco was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates twenty-two years ago as well. Even at the age of 23, his appearance, for the most part, resembles his present self. As a kid, Marco's signature tuft of hair was curlier. He sported a vertically striped shirt, with black pants, and no shoes. As a teenager, his appearance was not much different. After the timeskip, while working as a doctor on Whitebeard's home island, Marco wears a light button-up shirt as well as a pair of eyeglasses. He also has more facial hair. During the raid on Onigashima, Marco wears his initial attire and retains his eyeglasses.", "personality": "Marco is generally calm and level-headed in the face of adversity or challenge; the only strong emotional moments he has shown so far were directly related to Whitebeard's health (after he was stabbed in the torso by his own subordinate Squard and after his death). When Ace and Whitebeard were killed, Marco and the rest of the Whitebeard Pirates were in tears. In fact, seeing his captain, Whitebeard, get stabbed through the chest by a deceived Squard was enough for Marco to lose his usually unshakable cool-headedness that he immediately flew over to where they were to smash Squard's head against the Moby Dick's figurehead. He also demonstrates himself to be acute at detecting power, able to quickly notice the presence of Red-Haired Shanks' Hashoku Haki before anyone else aboard the Moby Dick as well as the underlying potential of Monkey D. Luffy. He clearly cares for his crew as he warned them to stay back from Shanks' Haki. Having been a member of the Whitebeard Pirates for at least thirty years, Marco has an extremely high degree of experience with exposure and combat inside the treacherous New World. After Whitebeard's and Portgas D. Ace's deaths at Marineford, Marco took the position of commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, highlighting his level of intelligence and suitability in taking up a commanding position. He appears to be somewhat playful, pretending to be hurt from Admiral Kizaru's attack with obvious sarcasm, though he can also quickly become serious. Marco seems to appreciate raw talent, even if it comes from someone whom he had never met before (i.e., Luffy). Because of this and based on the fact that Luffy intercepted Crocodile's attack on Whitebeard, Marco immediately took a liking to him. When he was an apprentice, he appeared to be a cheerful person. He was also encouraging as he cheered on Oden when he came close to passing Whitebeard's test to join the crew. He showed a playful side when he noticed Oden being close to Toki. Like some other characters, Marco has a very particular speech habit, which is a simple tic without meaning, ending his sentences with \"-yoi\" (?): e.g. \"arigat-yoi\" (?, \"thanks-yoi\") or \"mattero-yoi\" (?, \"wait-yoi\").", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former 1st division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Marco held authority over the 1,600 crew members lower-ranked than him, while enjoying particularly deep trust by Whitebeard as his \"right hand\". A veteran of the crew, Marco had been part of it for at least thirty years, from the time of Gol D. Roger in his apprentice days. Following Whitebeard's death, Marco assumed full leadership of the Whitebeard Pirates, their retreat from Marineford seemingly made under his command. Later on, it was he who led the crew into the Payback War against the Blackbeard Pirates, until the crew's subsequent dissolution after the Blackbeard Pirates had defeated them. Marco's status in the world is well-established, not least by his massive bounty of 1,374,000,000. After the war at Marineford, the Five Elders mentioned Marco (only him by name) with the remaining Whitebeard Pirates as one of the few groups left capable of defeating Blackbeard, who at that point was already held to be the chief candidate for succeeding Whitebeard as Emperor. Other Emperors have also expressed their respect for Marco: Shanks on three separate occasions called on him to join his crew, and Big Mom acknowledged Marco's strength by noting that his allegiance to the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance was unbecoming of a man of his caliber. In battle, Marco is shown to be a very powerful combatant. At Marineford he, if only briefly, fought and held his own against each of the three Marine admirals, indicating his capabilities. During the Raid on Onigashima, Marco had a brief, head-on clash with Big Mom on what seemed to be even terms, Marco appearing confident that he could keep the Emperor occupied. When abandoning their confrontation, Big Mom stated that she did not have enough souls to spare on Marco. Later during the raid, Marco effectively held off and overpowered the two All-Stars King and Queen, Kaidou's two strongest combatants with bounties over 1.3 billion, at once; however, Marco did state that fighting the two was difficult for him, and he sustained some light injuries amid the engagement until eventually (if only temporarily) succumbing to exhaustion. Marco is shown to have a strong will, remaining unfazed by the Emperor Shanks' Haoshoku Haki as it was knocking his lower-ranked crewmates unconscious by the dozens. Since childhood Marco has been very intelligent, supporting his crew with more than just battle power by providing knowledge and insight. He had enough medical knowledge to act, assisted by his powers, as a ship doctor, and while as a child he had a big passion for navigation, it is unknown how deep his knowledge runs in the present. Marco possesses immense physical strength. He could clash with marine admirals, blowing Kizaru and Aokiji large distances away using simple kicks (overpowering the former's one-armed guard and breaking the latter's Ice Saber in the act). He easily toppled the Queen Mama Chanter, a gigantic ship, above the Wano waterfall entry in a single blow and was later seen clashing head-on against Big Mom while the woman was wielding Prometheus, seemingly matching up to the Emperor's monstrous strength in the process, for a brief time; ultimately though, Big Mom was able to restrain Marco with a one-handed chokehold. To King and Queen Marco has been repeatedly seen dealing powerful melee blows, his phoenix-legged kicks sending the All-Stars flying with great force and drawing blood. In the anime, Marco was even able to send Queen in his massive brachiosaurus form flying a fair distance away with a one-legged kick. Marco seems to prefer an off-the-ground, kick-emphasizing style of attack supplemented by his phoenix transformation. Aerially in his hybrid form, he has been seen delivering hard kicks (and even knee strikes) using his human legs or with his feet as phoenix talons, to deal slashing damage. Marco is extremely fast and agile, especially while flying. He sprung instantaneously to protect Whitebeard from Kizaru's Yasakani no Magatama, interposing himself between his captain and the extremely quick-moving barrage of light bullets, and went on to intercept and clash with the fast-as-light admiral. On top of his self-regeneration, Marco has exhibited great endurance. He was relatively fine (and able to run whilst healing) after having two of Kizaru's lasers pierce clean through his torso and was later shot yet another two times while Seastone-shackled (thus with his powers nullified), but was still able to stand and function normally thereafter. Marco ate the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a phoenix and a human-phoenix hybrid at will. He has a very well-developed mastery over his transformation, allowing him to alter select parts of his body as he needs to. This power is the source of his nickname \"Marco the Phoenix\". As a Zoan, Marco enjoys a great boost to his physical abilities, gaining strength enough to restrain two extremely powerful Ancient Zoan users at once. Furthermore, as a bird-type Zoan, Marco gains wings that allow him to fly in both his hybrid form and full phoenix form, as well as taloned bird legs that he can use to perform powerful kicks or slash enemies with. Marco can freely create his \"Blue Flames of Resurrection\" from any part of his body, even without actually transforming, and they always cover him while transformed. These phoenix flames are stronger than normal fire and possess tremendous healing properties; while shrouded in the flames, Marco can rapidly self-regenerate from nearly any physical damage he receives, like a phoenix being reborn. It is noted, or at least implied, that no matter what injury he is dealt, he can recover by flame (even injures that he suffered while his powers are nullified). Such immense power of recovery allows Marco to ward off extremely potent attacks with little issue, like Kizaru's volley of light bullets or even Akainu's magma punch. Marco can also share his healing flames with others, allowing him to mend them as well, even multiple individuals at once. However, his flames are less effective on anyone other than himself. Marco is a highly skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, shown by his ability to imbue his legs with it to physically contact and kick away Logia users such as Marine Admirals Kizaru and Aokiji. He, alongside Vista, used this type of Haki against Admiral Akainu, although it had zero effect on him. Marco can use Kenbunshoku Haki. During the Raid on Onigashima, he was able to sense when Luffy's Devil Fruit Awakening occurred."},

In the manga, he wears epaulettes which may serve to differentiate himself in rank as a Chief Petty Officer.

{"name": "Magellan", "episode": "Episode 528", "chapter": "Chapter 425", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Hannyabal in Chapter 526.", "appearance": "Magellan is a large man, about three times the height of a normal human. He has a face that resembles a mandrill, with very sharp teeth and a thick beard. His fingers closely resemble those of the Blue Gorillas. He wears bat wings and horn-like ornaments on his head, the latter of which he can pull out and use as weapons. Underneath those horns, he has short black twintail-styled hair. Overall, Magellan resembles a devil. While most guards wear a white-colored uniform, Magellan wears a black-colored suit with a red shirt underneath. His suit features more buttons than those of his subordinates. Draped over his right shoulder is a piece of rope. He wears what appears to be the standard cap of Impel Down workers. Twenty years ago, while Magellan was still the vice-chief, he had the same attire as he does today, with the exception of the uniform being tan instead of black, and a green shirt. After the timeskip, Magellan still wears the same attire as two years ago. He has gained scars on the left side of his face which cover his cheek and eye. Also, his left wing and his left horn are broken and have been repaired with sheet metal. All these scars and new designs on his appearance are very likely from the near-death experience he gained from the Level 6 inmates escaping. When he was a young child, he was chubby, and his horns were much smaller. He had hairy arms and his fingernails were painted black. He had a light-colored long sleeve shirt with a three headed dragon on it along with light colored shorts and black shoes. He is depicted as watering some flowers. However, they died due to the poison oozing off his arm, showing that he already had his Devil Fruit power as a child.", "personality": "Magellan's biggest quirk is his severe diarrhea brought upon by his frequent consumption of poisoned food. His Devil Fruitability gives him immunity from actually being poisoned, but it does not spare him from diarrhea. As a result, he spends approximately ten hours each day in the bathroom relieving himself and eight hours sleeping; even after suffering such conditions multiple times, he still insists on eating poisoned food. It has been hinted that he is actually agoraphobic and enjoys dark, enclosed spaces. Though he only performs roughly four hours of duty per day as Warden of Impel Down, he still takes his role quite seriously and does not tolerate the prisoners' bad behavior. As he has permission to execute any one of them he sees fit, he shows no hesitation to drench them in his Hydra's lethal poison, as seen with what happened on Level 6 when insulted by prisoners. Magellan also takes great pride in keeping Impel Down's reputation of being impenetrable and inescapable, and felt personally insulted when Monkey D. Luffy became the first to stain that record since Shiki 20 years ago. Despite his demotion, he is still considered the most reliable man of Impel Down. Magellan's pride with Impel Down led him to reject the help of the Marines and any other outsiders, and instead took a risk and released Shiryu to assist him, which turned out to be a critical mistake that nearly cost Magellan his life. Even when he was in a near-death state, Magellan wanted to take responsibility for the Level 6 convicts to the point that he wanted to commit suicide for his failure. Magellan seems to find it amusing whenever someone he does not particularly like gets poisoned or suffocated by his powers, evident when he was seen chuckling at Hannyabal after he sighed a poisonous mist in the latter's direction. While he also does not tolerate Hannyabal's poisonous (the actual term used is punned with the word distant) comments he himself is prone to use them against himself. It is also shown that he is not as emotionally stern as Hannyabal, as he clearly went head over heels for and was easily persuaded by Boa Hancock, while the vice warden remained focused and serious with the crisis they were having. Despite the silly aspects of himself, he is an extremely serious combatant, speaking little and never toying with his opponent. His ruthlessness applies not only to the prisoners, but also to his own men, as seen when he was berating a guard who was accidentally poisoned by his Hydra. He will also not tolerate any of his own men who abuse their power, as he dismissed Shiryu for killing prisoners for fun and had him jailed in Level 6, this intolerance renders Magellan unable to forgive, as even though he accepted Shiryu's assistance, he only postponed the death sentence, rather than retracting it.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former warden of Impel Down, Magellan is a very powerful individual who was in complete control of the prison. However, after the timeskip, with Hannyabal now the warden and Magellan having been demoted to vice warden, his control of the prison is second to Hannyabal. He has both the authority and the ability to execute any of the prisoners within Impel Down as he sees fit. Despite being occupied by intense diarrhea for 10 hours per day, sleeping for another 8 and recessing for another 2, Magellan is still capable of easily coordinating the defense squads of Impel Down in case of a potential break-in or break-out, as well as being fully aware of all the mechanics of the prison's traps. However, since Magellan's work hours are limited by his diarrhea, Shiryu was considered more dangerous. Despite this, he was apparently the one responsible for defeating Shiryu and locking him in Level 6, although it is unknown how it happened. Even Emporio Ivankov, a commander in the Revolutionary Army, was shown to be no match for him, being defeated in no time and very easily. According to Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, Magellan is known to silence even the most ultimate of prisoners. Indeed that all the prisoners are afraid of him. Even two former Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile and Jinbe, were concerned of Magellan's upcoming arrival. He also easily defeated Luffy, who even after using Galdino's wax armor, effectively against the Magellan fruit, was unable to stop him. He also easily dispatched the Warlord of the Sea Blackbeard and his crew in one fell swoop when they first met. However, according to Shiryu, this happened because they underestimated Magellan's strength. Even without his Devil Fruit powers, Magellan is far stronger than normal humans, as he easily blocked awax-covered Gomu Gomu no Champion Stampwith one arm, as well as pillars of stone hurled at him by Inazuma with both of his forearms. He also pinned down Ace with just one arm when the young pirate attempted to get away. He was shown to have excellent reflexes, as he was able to follow Luffy's movements without any difficulty despite the latter using Gear Second. He is also incredibly resilient, as he took many ofMonkey D. Luffy'sGear 2attacks straight on (an impressive feat as Luffy's Gear 2 attacks are capable of breaking through strong defensesquite easily) and managed to stand back up to continue fighting with no lasting injuries, as well as receiving multiple shots of cannon fire without any resulting injuries. Magellan was also relatively unfazed by the boiling temperatures of Levels 3 and 4 or the sub-zero temperatures of Level 5 in Impel Down. Magellan ate the Doku Doku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and control poison. He can produce various types of poison, ranging from a mild irritant to a strong paralyzing agent, to a deadly and highly corrosive toxin. He can produce these poisons in either liquid or gaseous states. He is also completely immune to all types of poison. He can create massive amounts of liquid poison that he can shape into a gigantic monstrous entity, such as a hydra or a demon. Magellan can use his poison as a means of transportation, sending himself through it like a pneumatic tube. He can also cover himself with a thick layer of liquid poison, giving him a virtual suit of armor. Said armor does not offer much fortitude, but it does dissuade his opponents from attacking him directly for fear of being poisoned. His poisoning can be cured fairly easily individually, however, a mix of various poisons is nearly impossible to cure. His most powerful poison is called Kinjite, which Magellan himself has stated is powerful enough to \"destroy Impel Down itself\". Not only is this poison more lethal and fast acting than most, but it also spreads out from any surface it touches, literally \"infecting\" everything, including stone. He likes to add poison to his food for flavor, while he is immune to the poison, the tainted food afflicts him with excessive diarrhea, causing him to spend approximately 10 hours a day on the toilet. This is a big problem for him since he loves to eat poisoned food. The ends of Magellan's horns are detachable and can be worn like boxing gloves over four fingers (his thumbs stick out). The sharp points allow for the weapons to slash and pierce. Magellan can also transmit his poison abilities through the horns and dissolve anything they touch."},

He was even able to shrug off one of Dellinger's high powered kicks with his only reaction being mild pain, while powerful fighters like Bellamy were seriously injured by similar attacks. Machvise ate the Ton Ton no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to drastically increase his own body weight, leveled by metric tons. The force of his weight is powerful enough to easily crack the ground, and even the bones of a giant. His main style of fighting involves getting above his targets, high into the air, and then swiftly increasing his weight to fall on his enemy in an attempt to crush them into the ground. Machvise's signature weapon is a round, cross-shaped shield that he uses to crush his enemies with in conjunction with his Devil Fruit power.

The muscles in his legs are very strong and surprisingly flexible. Roux is the chef of Red Hair Pirates. Roux possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. He used a flintlock pistol to shoot a mountain bandit that was threatening Shanks at point blank range."},

As prince of Elbaf, he commands an entire military of giants, which is said to be the strongest in the entire world; Big Mom was confident that, had she taken over that military, she could have defeated the other Four Emperors and become the Pirate King. Being the prince, he also had the privilege of proposing to the 23rd daughter of Big Mom, who was deeply hated by the giants, and had the marriage been successful, Loki's political influence would have allowed the giants' grudge against Big Mom to cease. Since Big Mom attempted to deceive Loki after failing to deliver Lola as an arranged bride, the giants as a whole came to detest her even further for offending their prince."},

This sets her apart from the real Lola, who simply proposes to any man she has her sights on, and lets him go upon being rejected. Also, while the real Lola continuously tries finding a different man to propose to after being rejected, the zombie who carried her shadow focused entirely one man. Also, unlike the original Lola, who takes the constant rejections well and acknowledges them instantly, the zombie would employ underhanded tactics like attempting to trick Absalom into signing a marriage registration without his consent and kill anyone else whom Absalom fancied to be his wife, as well as attack anyone who tried to stop her from doing so. However, she was not without intelligence, as she immediately saw through Nami's claim of being a man and created an opportunity for her to escape from Absalom by pretending to attack her in a fit of rage during their \"wedding\". Additionally, she is perfectly capable of forming a meaningful and sententious friendship with someone who supports her feelings toward Absalom.", "abilities_and_powers": "Lola possessed considerable physical strength, having effortlessly wielded a large axe in combat, smacked Inuppe away with enough force to crater the wall he crashed into, and carried around the weight of both Usopp and Tony Tony Chopper (in his human form), both of whom she sent flying simultaneously with a flick of her head; using her katanas, she can cut through solid stone with ease. She also had inhuman durability and stamina; when Absalom blasted her with his bazooka, not only did she remain conscious after the blast, but she got to her feet a few minutes later without displaying any lasting injuries or fatigue beyond some moderate scratches. While not exactly a fighting style, Lola practiced a form of martial arts called Hanayome Bujutsu (, Bridal Arts?)(Bridal Martial Arts in the Funimation dub) that acted as a way for her to show her affection toward the one she loved rather than as a way to defeat an opponent. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. Concludes non-canon section. Lola wielded two large katanas that she keeps strapped to her back, similar to the original owner of her shadow. Her proficiency with them is unknown, but she could slash very rapidly with them in combat, as well as convincingly attack someone without actually hurting them.

His nickname is a tribute to his ancestor Oars who was taller. His overall shape and silhouette resembles his ancestor greatly - large forearms and hands, small lower body and barrel-like gut. His skin is yellow-green and he has orange hair reaching down to his legs, which are quite small in comparison to his large belly and hairy forearms. He has large fangs and horns pointing upward, black triangle-like marks just above his eyes, and some stubble on his chin. He also wears three skulls on a beaded necklace rather than a belt, but the most notable item among his effects is a gigantic kasa hat that Ace made for him, which is usually seen resting on his back in a similar fashion to Luffy. He also sports a black, open indument that looks like a jacket, samurai-like armor plates protecting his chest and back, linked together by chains, and a loincloth with a mimetic pattern on it which looks like the Marine's battleships' hull and which is held up by a fur-lined belt. He carries around a gigantic sword fitting his size, with a large blade and a long hilt. In the video game One Piece: Gigant Battle!, his color scheme is similar to his ancestor Oars (the game was developed before Little Oars Jr.' color scheme was revealed in the anime).", "personality": "Little Oars Jr. seems to be a very caring and kind person at heart. As shown in flashbacks, he was carefree and appreciated the little things in life, such as the straw hat Ace made for him. He is also shown to be very determined and loyal, as demonstrated when he went straight through enemy lines to rescue Ace, despite being hit by Kuma's Ursus Shock, impaled by Gecko Moria's Tsuno-Tokage and having one of his legs severed by Doflamingo. This mirrors his ancestor's determination and endurance, but contrasts with his brutal, ruthless nature.", "abilities_and_powers": "Little Oars Jr. is a fearsome pirate who has managed to make a name for himself in the New World and allying himself with the Whitebeard Pirates. In addition, he has obtained a bounty of 550,000,000, which indicates his power and danger. As a giant of immense size, Little Oars Jr. has incredible strength, enough to lift both Marine battleships and one of Whitebeard's paddle ships and throw them, the first for destruction, and the second as a way of helping his allies to enter the Plaza. He also displayed incredible fortitude in proportion with his own size, since he was relatively unfazed after receiving several cannon shots from the marines prior to being felled by Kuma's Ursus Shock. Little Oars Jr. also has immense stamina and pain tolerance; he sustained injuries from three Warlords of the Sea, incoming Marine officersand the Marines' artillery without once losing his resolve to save Ace, and standing back on his feet after a short time. Ordinary cannon fire seems to have little effect on him. He was able to beat Vice Admiral Lacroix effortlessly and it took an enormous amount of damage for him to lose consciousness and pass out. Little Oars Jr. carries around a gigantic sword fitting his size. It has a broad blade with a single cutting edge, and a long hilt with a red hilt-wrapping. When not in use, it's seen resting on its owner's right hip, suggesting that Little Oars Jr. is left-handed, or even ambidextrous. When in his hands, the sword becomes a terrifying weapon, as the sheer force behind his blows can shatter almost any other weapon, including those wielded by other giants.

Despite the technology and weaponry at her disposal, Lilith was cautioned by Shaka that she was not equipped to take on Roronoa Zoro and Nico Robin, two members of an Emperor's crew with bounties around 1 billion, in combat. Lilith has made heavy use of mechas and cybernetically enhanced animals to aid her in combat. She pilots a giant mecha called the Vega Force 1, which is extremely large to the point of being able to carry the Thousand Sunny in its hands. The Vega Force is able to move underwater and unleash explosions when it punches. Additionally, Lilith has power over Sea Beasts that she has turned into cyborgs. These Sea Beasts are equipped with numerous weapons, with an example being the Mecha-Shark having a torpedo launcher in its mouth. This army of cyborg creatures allows Lilith to easily surround and overwhelm ships sailing the sea, enabling her to loot them. However, she has had issues with achieving programming to completely override the organic urges of the creatures, which limits her ability to have them do exactly what she wants; Shaka himself would also note that any equipment, weaponry and modified Sea Beasts at Lilith's disposal would be useless against a swordsman of Zoro's caliber. Lilith wields a large futuristic-looking gun, called a Bubble Gun (, Baburugan?) because it shoots bubbles that are capable of deflecting any attacks. These bubbles, called Bubble Balls (, Baburubru?), are made of a special material containing sea energy, meaning they also serve as a weakness for Devil Fruit users."},

However, he appears to possess an additional, humorous measure of obliviousness, as he misinterprets Princess Mansherry's flirtatious behavior towards him as selfishness, meanness, and capriciousness, not realizing that it is actually caused by her feelings of affection towards him. Despite his gullibility, Leo refused to believe Trebol when he said that Usopp lied to them about being a hero. He, like Kin'emon, appears to have little knowledge of Devil Fruits, as he referred to his and Robin's powers as magic.

At the same time with his strength, skill and quick thinking he was able to defeat Giolla, an officer of the Donquixote Pirates. Leo ate the Nui Nui no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit that grants him the ability to stitch things together and un-stitch them like nothing happened. The stitches are strong enough to immobilize a person on the ground. Leo also uses it in combat to sew his enemies together and make them slam into each other. Leo refers to it as magic \"Nui Nui\" Power (\"\", Nui Nui no Chikara?) rather than a Devil Fruit. Leo wears a pair of needles strapped to his belt in order to use his Nui Nui power.

His skin is black (blue in the anime), coupled with short fins and a fluked tail. Much of his head is crisscrossed with scars, from his many years of tackling Reverse Mountain. After meeting the Straw Hats, Laboon had a crude replica of their Jolly Roger painted over these scars. His interior contains a complex network of metal chambers and tunnels, installed - presumably by Crocus - to deal with his habit of swallowing ships that challenge or annoy him. The largest of these chambers, built into his stomach, can receive newly-swallowed ships from his esophagus and allow them to leave through a set of gates leading to his blowhole; it also holds an artificial island with a cabin for Crocus to \"vacation\" in. This chamber is \"painted\" with an unknown material that not only resembles the daytime sky (complete with clouds) but apparently produces its own light. 52 years ago, he had rounder teeth and was around the size of a small dinghy, just large enough to carry two or three men.

He is also a bit stubborn, as he would not believe the fact that his friends had died, despite Crocus's constant explanation. He would hit the Red Line constantly, completely ignoring Crocus's protests. He also seems to have a bit of a playful nature, as evidenced by Crocus. In his early years, he was a happy little Island Whale who formed a strong bond with the Rumbar Pirates. However, his happiness was shattered and he fell into a deep depression after he was told that they had fled the Grand Line, leaving him behind. His strong will and determination was led by a blind ambition to see his friends again, clinging on to what little hope he had for their safety. Because of this, he tried to break through the Red Line, so that he could get to the West Blue and rejoin his friends. Later, when Luffy fought him and painted the Straw Hat Jolly Roger on his head, Luffy promised to have a rematch when they meet again.

His connection with the Rumbar Pirates remained strong even after that, as when Brook joined the Straw Hat Pirates, Laboon was noted to be unusually happy.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to the foremost part of his head, called \"hammer head\", that has spike-like protuberances, Laboon is resistant to most physical damage, and was able to survive daily headbutts against the Red Line for decades (albeit not without medical assistance from Crocus). However, he did react in pain when Luffy slammed the mast of the Going Merry into a fresh wound on his head. Laboon is also able to swallow small-to-medium-sized ships without much difficulty, trapping them inside his stomach. While his stomach acid is mild enough that even an unarmed human can survive brief exposure, lengthy exposure can very much prove fatal. Intellectually, Laboon is highly capable of understanding both human languageand psyches.

Despite being a malevolent pirate, Laffitte has an extremely refined and sophisticated personality, always speaking in a polite and courteous manner even when threatening people such Avalo Pizarro for wanting to replace Teach as captain. He also reprimanded Burgess for his habit of referring Teach as \"captain\" instead of \"admiral\". Like the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates, Laffitte believes strongly in luck, fate, and dreams.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former sheriff, Laffitte had authority and power over citizens. However, due to his extreme cruelty, he lost this authority when he was exiled. After the time-skip, he is officially the Captain of the Blackbeard Pirates 5th fleet/ship and part of a group of Ten Titanic Captains that personally guard the Emperor, Blackbeard. Although his combat abilities are unknown, he must be someone very powerful. The fact, that Blackbeard refuses to accept any weakling in his crew, even going so far as to reject Super Rookie Jewelry Bonney with a bounty of 140,000,000, is further testament to Laffite's power. He seems to have confidence in his abilities as he threatened to kill Avalo Pizarro, one of the most powerful criminals in Level 6. He was also quickly recognized by Vice Admiral Tsuru. It was stated during the Marineford Arc that he was able to hypnotize Marines to open the Gates of Justice for him. Laffitte is considerably skilled in infiltration. When he traveled to Mary Geoise, he easily bypassed all the security defenses of the sacred land of the World Government and joined in the meeting for the new Warlord of the Sea nomination, all without being noticed until he willingly revealed himself, a notable feat considering he was able to sneak past a number of high ranking Marines and three Warlords who each boast considerable degrees of sensory Haki, while wearing tap shoes no less (anime-only feature). Later at Marineford, before the Blackbeard Pirates sailed to Impel Down, Laffitte infiltrated the control room to hypnotize the Marines present there without being noticed. As a navigator, Laffitte guides the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates through the open seas. His level of navigational skills are as of yet unknown, though it is expected he is a significantly skilled navigator to navigate through the Grand Line including the seas of the New World. Interestingly enough, despite his occupation, he is not seen carrying a Log Pose, which is essential for navigating in the Grand Line. Laffitte is able to quickly move in a similar fashion to the Soru technique as shown in Blackbeard's fight with Ace. Laffitte has been shown to possess a large amount of endurance being able to continue fighting even after taking one of Whitebeard's Gura Gura no Mi shockwaves (albeit not a direct hit) and a direct hit from Fleet Admiral Sengoku's shockwaves with the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates. Laffitte has eaten an unnamed Devil Fruit and shown that he can transform his arms into a pair of bird-like wings, though it has not been confirmed if this is the Fruit's ability or a power separate from it. He demonstrated this ability when the Blackbeard Pirates invaded Impel Down. Laffitte carries a cane that he spins to accompany his tap-dancing from time to time; it is yet unknown if it can be used as a weapon. Laffitte was using a pistol when he helped to murder Whitebeard. He was also seen holding it while keeping Marine soldiers away from Blackbeard."},
{"name": "Lao G", "episode": "Episode 682", "chapter": "Chapter 608", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 702.", "appearance": "Lao G is old and rather short. He is bald with veins protruding from his head. He has a beard and wrinkled skin. In his appearances, his eyes have been shadowed out, as they areextremely squinted. His mouth is also shadowed, suggesting that he doesn't have any teeth despite being able to speak and eat. He wears a blue jumpsuit with a white arrow pointing upwards with two blue lightning bolt-like shapes pointing towards his shoulders. The jumpsuit has a belt with the letter \"G\" on the buckle. He also wears white gloves and boots. He wears red tights under his jumpsuit, with blue arrows pointing downward on his legs. As a child, Lao G had a curly patch of hair on his forehead with the front curl resembling a G. He wore a shirt with an arrow pointing upwards that had a \"G\" on it, a sash around his waist, white gloves, and black pants. His eyes were also wide and visible, yet to turn squinted. At age 54, he wore a dark blue bunny-eared hat and had a more muscular body, as well as a black beard trimmed to form a G, and was shown to still have teeth. At age 60, his hair had started to gray and he was becoming pot-bellied. He wore a cap with devilish horns and eyes, gloves, a blue bodysuit with a yellow gold matrix-pattern, what seems to be briefs over it and a belt with the green letter \"G\" as the gold yellow buckle.", "personality": "He is a stern and loyal man, as is seen by hisfollowing Doflamingo's orders to the letter and regarding his captain's orders as absolute. He is very calm and analytical, as he was able to deduce that Doflamingo had an ulterior motive for his supposed abdication. However, despite his calm demeanor, Lao G has a bombastic and brutal side, joyfully showing his techniques against enemies to prove himself as a superior fighter and viciously pummeling his foes with brutal efficiency. In the anime, Lao G takes great pride in his skill, boasting to Sai, a formidable fighter in his own right, that he would need a century's worth of training to defeat him. He also has an odd quirk that makes him emphasize the letter \"G\" in his words and even goes so far as to mimic it with his hands in various ways. Lao G can also be exceptionally cruel as he gleefully mocked Baby 5 for being convenient for the Donquixote Family's purposes due to her desperation to be needed and viciously disposed of Don Chinjao when he was distracted. He seems to be rather senile in his old age, such as when he went back into the elevator that he had just left instead of going to the Toy House. He appears to be far-sighted, as he needed glasses in order to spot Kabu up close. This does not seem to affect his fighting capabilities, however, as he was able to swat Kabu away quickly with minimal effort. He is also hard of hearing. He has his own Laughter Style: \"Fafafafafafa\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Lao G held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members and addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the Corrida Colosseum's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high, despite his age. It is said that when Lao G and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory.This is especially notable, as Lao G is the only one of the officers to lack Devil Fruit powers or fish-man heritage, while boasting the same achievement based on physical skill alone. Doflamingo also trusted him enough to guard the entrance to his factory from the Straw Hats' actions. Despite his elderly age, Lao G has proven himself to be an extremely powerful and skilled martial artist, being able to knock down Thunder Soldier, a toy known for his speed and dexterity, with ease and pummel larger opponents with little effort. His incredible speed and reflexes are seen further when he managed to put his glasses on and then swat Kabu away in a fraction of a second, despite the fact that the dwarf, a member of a species that can move faster than the untrained eye can see, was mere inches away from his face. Despite his frail appearance and behaviors, Lao G has a massive level of durability and endurance, able to survive with no notable injuries and stay conscious after Sai directly kicked his head with a Busoshoku Haki-imbued Kiryu Kirikugi, which split the entire ground they were standing on. Even the likes of Chinjao, a pirate of legendary strength, is shown to be no match for him (although at the time the latter was still weakened by his fight against Luffy). He was the one who taught Law hand-to-hand combat, along with a diagram of pressure points, showing his skills as a teacher. However, his legs seem to be frail from old age, as they were shivering while standing, and his eyesight requires spectacles to see more clearly. Lao G also has shown that his hearing is not very good, as could not hear people that were right in front of him. His body can even become so weak that his spirit may leave it and be ready to pass on.However, he can just as quickly recover from near-death if he feels he has been called back, showing that he still has a very strong life force. Lao G is a master of a martial arts style known as the Jio-Ken. The techniques utilized all revolve a theme around his advanced age, taking advantage of any debilitating symptoms of an elderly as his fighting stance. With his mastery of Jio-Ken, he could fight and overwhelm Chinjao, who is an extremely powerful master of Hasshoken. Lao G can use the ultimate technique of this style, which is to use qigong, the principle of cultivating and balancing one's own spiritual energy, to conserve his physical vitality from back during his youth, which he can store up until he needs it, granting him access to them immense strength of his prime once unleashed, thus negating his weaknesses of senescence. In fact, it would seem that the practitioner's fighting prowess even increases as they age. In the past, Lao G used a bazooka to attack a Marines ship."},

The doctor wears round glasses, a white a-shirt with a cross on the front, striped-patterned pants, white shoes, a doctor's coat with the name \"Dr. Black Beard\" on the left side, a medical cross on each side of the collar, and carries a pen in the right breast pocket of the coat. Because of their similar appearance, Ace accidentally mistook the doctor for the true Blackbeard.", "personality": "Kurotsuru dislikes Ace because the young pirate kicked him in the face.

{"name": "Kurozumi Higurashi", "episode": "Episode 965", "chapter": "Chapter 965", "year": 2019, "note": "Her name was revealed in Chapter 969.", "appearance": "Higurashi was an extremely old and decrepit woman with long, wild water green hair and a cleft chin. She had several missing teeth. Over 41 years ago, during her meeting with Orochi, she wore a tattered light kimono and dark pants, and had two lit candles fastened to her forehead with a headband. 25 years ago, after Orochi became the shogun of Wano Country, her clothes seem to be well maintained. She is also shown to have blackened her teeth. Due to her Mane Mane no Mi abilities, she could alter her physical appearance into a number of individuals, two of whom being Kozuki Sukiyaki and Oden.", "personality": "Higurashi believed that those with power decided what was right and wrong, and did not view any attempt to gain power as wrong, even if it involved murder. Thus, she was sympathetic to the Kurozumi Family's first attempt to gain the shogunate, and used deceit to help Orochi take the title. Higurashi was very cunning, and would stop at nothing to get what she wants. She was very cautious, having Orochi gather funds and weaponry well before his rise to power, knowing the benefits of those markets in the long run. When she saw Kozuki Oden humiliate himself on the street of the Flower Capital, she cackled with her family members, enjoying their successes. In battle, she did not follow any code of honor, as she disguised herself as Kozuki Momonosuke and with the help of a Beasts Pirate member, distracted Oden with a hostage situation so Kaidou could get the upper hand. However, this came at the cost of her life, as Kaidou was intolerable of foul play in regards to his battles. Like many other people, she possessed a unique laughter style: \"Ni kyo kyo kyo kyo\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Higurashi has proven herself to be an adept strategist, as she instructed Orochi to amass funding and weaponry in order for a successful coup-d'tat, which Orochi eventually used the wealth and massive weapons stock to form an alliance with Emperor Kaidou. She also has knowledge of Devil Fruits, considering the isolated country of Wano's limited knowledge, as she knew the power of the one she ate while offering Orochi another. Higurashi ate the Mane Mane no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that enabled her to perfectly replicate other people's appearances. She used this fruit to deceive the Wano administration by posing as Kozuki Oden and Sukiyaki and using their likenesses to promote Orochi. She also used this ability in the battlefield effectively, disguising herself as Momonosuke in order to distract Oden."},
{"name": "Kuro", "episode": "Episode 23", "chapter": "Chapter 9", "year": 1998, "note": "He was introduced with his alias, Klahadore. His real name was revealed by Jango in Chapter 26.", "appearance": "Kuro is a tall and slim man with glasses and slicked black hair, though during his fight with Luffy strands fell off onto his face. During his stay on Gecko Islands, he wore a black suit with two golden markings on it over a white shirt with a curious collar, with spiral-like protrusions on the edges, and a standard black tie. He also sports striped shoes (which he apparently kept from his life as a pirate). He would loosen up the tie and collar on the night before the planned raid on Syrup Village. During his time as a pirate, he wore a standard black captain's coat with a red interior and the Black Cat Pirates' symbol on the epaulets. Under the coat he wore a simple white shirt and a pair of black pants reaching down to his knees along with his trademark shoes. Kuro is always seen wearing round glasses that tend to slip off. Despite requiring Kuro to routinely push them back into place, they are nevertheless his signature belongings, as he rejected a more fitting pair from Kaya. Luffy shattered the lenses with a punch in their fight, while the final headbutt bent the frame.", "personality": "Kuro is an extremely intelligent man (holding the second highest IQ in East Blue, behind only Benn Beckman), whose plans have never failed in the past. He is a master strategist and an accomplished fighter, but he was severely hampered by the fact that he simply did not have the patience to deal with a pirate's life on the run from the Marines. He came to desire a life of luxury and peace, giving up his infamy and name in his attempt to achieve it as he concluded he was not suited to be a pirate. Despite his intellect, he has a tendency to underestimate his opponents based on their seemingly harmless appearance, as he believed that Usopp and the Straw Hat Pirates were no threat, which became his downfall. His confidence in his plans tend to lead him to be reckless as well, as he believed that since the pirate attack was nigh, he saw no reason to restrain himself from his feral instincts by needlessly attacking Merry, thus resulting in the surviving Merry to report to Kaya of Kuro's true intentions. Kuro seems to be very proud of his plans, which had never failed before (hence his nickname, Kuro of a Hundred Plans). True to his epithet in both figurative and literal meaning, he conceived many well thought out plans and would achieve them by all means. When he relived his moments of piracy, he claimed his plans were too great to be wasted on his crew. Because of his pride within his plans, Kuro is intolerant of any failures on his subordinates' part, and would kill them if they were to hinder his plans in any way, even if it was due to bad luck as opposed to incompetence. He valued his plots to perfection, as he refused Kaya's negotiations for leaving the village alone in exchange for handing over the estate and fortune he desired, insisting the attack and her death must occur for the sake of his plan. During the final moments before Luffy defeated him, Kuro lost his composure and screamed at the despair of his precious plan failing. He also seems to like the glasses he wears very much, even though they tend to slip down his nose every so often. He pushes them up with his palms so he does not scratch his face with his Cat Claws, a symbol of remembering his murderous ways. Even after the lens were shattered by Luffy's punch, he kept them on. The glasses are his signature belongings, and, as such, he destroyed the new ones Kaya gave him (though it may be because he simply hated her). Kuro, being selfish and arrogant, is very cruel and diabolical towards everyone else, be they ally or enemy. He held himself in very high regard, having a standard for people no one but himself seemed able to live up to. He felt nothing for the lives of others, willingly sacrificing anyone he needed to achieve his ambitions. During his three years as Kaya's butler, he acted as a benign, trustworthy and well-manneredyet slightly snobbishman who carries a hatred for pirates, and as such, looks down on Usopp. He later admits that, aside from his hatred for Usopp and piracy, how much he despises this pseudo-personality; his hatred of piracy notwithstanding, the true reason is very different than that of his false persona. Kuro has proven himself to be a skilled actor, having created the personality of Klahadore, which was in stark contrast to that of his true persona, Kuro; he managed to maintain his act despite his deep hatred of Kaya and Usopp, enduring them with crocodile tears and verbal taunts, respectively, only revealing himself when he deemed it was no longer necessary. He differentiates his two personalities via his tone of speech: as Klahadore, he uses the formal pronoun \"watashi\" (?) to refer himself, while as Kuro, he uses the more arrogant \"ore\" (?); the anime furthers the two personas by \"Klahadore\" speaking in a lighter and a very formal tone while \"Kuro\" has a deeper and much colder voice. His sudden change in personality induced great fear into Merry and Kaya. Kuro has proven himself to be quite a hypocrite. While discussing his plans regarding Kaya with Jango, Kuro would avoid using the word \"kill\" due to believing it to be barbaric, referring to her planned death as an \"accident\" to make it sound more civilized. Once his true intentions came to light and his patience with his crew waned, Kuro bluntly stated that he would kill, even directing such cruelty to Kaya when she confronted him. He later revealed that he never intended to let his crew leave Gecko Island alive despite his earlier claim that three years of inactivity had softened his heart (hence giving his crew five minutes to redeem themselves). Stating how much he detested piracy due to his belief that they are simply buffoons who robbed and killed out of greed and self-gratification, he has proven himself to be no better due to his plot to take everything away from Kaya while reveling on killing all the villagers. Though able to restrain himself most of the time, to the point of appearing to be a civilized person who abhors senseless violence, deep down Kuro is a very bloodthirsty man, using death and brutality as means to punish any subordinates who failed him or even stand in his way during his attacks; this trait comes to full effect upon seeing a crescent moon, which drives him wild and even he finds it difficult to resist the temptations of violence brought on by the stage of the moon. During his time as an active pirate, he was open about his murderous nature, as his crew feared him for his ruthlessness at all times. On the night of the Marine attack, there was once again a crescent moon, which seems to have been the reason why Kuro was so brutal to the Marines on board. Even after yearning a peaceful life devoid of the needless violence associated with piracy, Kuro still found the sight of a crescent moon an irresistible lure to his old ways, leading him to unnecessarily attack Merry simply to satisfy himself; his habit of pushing his glasses up with his palm instead of his fingers, whether as a pirate or butler, is proof that he has not forgotten his killing methods. His desire for retirement did nothing to curb his enjoyment of killing, as he reveled on the thought of killing Kaya and Usopp for money and revenge, respectively. As a consequence, during the first opening of the anime a red crescent moon can be briefly seen in the scene with Kuro.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kuro is feared by all his subordinates, all of whom obey him out of his well-known ruthlessness to both foes and allies alike. Despite the Nyaban Brothers believing that his skills dulled over the three years as a butler (something he admitted) and trying to kill him, he proved that he was still superior by easily overwhelming them at the tip of his claws. He also considered Zoro as \"soft\" in comparison for not successfully killing Buchi in one strike. Having achieved a bounty of over 10,000,000, Kuro was considered to be one of the more powerful pirates of East Blue's average standard of 3,000,000. Kuro is a master strategist who has never once before failed in his village raids, due to him planning skillfully beforehand. He was the second most intelligent person shown at the time of his debut, and was skilled enough to have tricked the Marines into making them think he died with a decoy, thus deactivating his bounty and infamy. Nicknamed \"Kuro of the Hundred Plans\" for his tactical genius, he is shown to be well-versed in tactics: he has the patience and determination to carry out a three-years plan right down to the most minute detail, and managed to perfectly blend into his \"alias\" Klahadore (winning the respect of the townspeople, the care of his adoptive family and managing to convince Syrup Village that the liar Usopp was of malicious intent), demonstrating expert manipulation skills. Even though Devil Fruits are rare in the East Blue, Kuro calmly came to acknowledge it as a fact when Luffy had demonstrated the powers of eating one, while many others (including the rest of the Black Cat Pirates) would be shocked to see what they believe to be a mere myth come to reality. During his three-years ruse as Kaya's servant, Kuro has been shown to be a capable butler despite his absolute hatred of being under her servitude, accompanying her in various shopping and sailing trips, taking care of her when she fell ill, and conversing with her adequately. He organized the mansion's security by hiring the guards. Despite his seemingly-frail build, Kuro's physical prowess is considerable, far above the average East Blue pirate (and carefully maintained, even during his years of civilian living). Speed is his primary asset, with his legs being powerful enough to cross 100 meters in four to five seconds (a speed of 20-25 meters per second). Per his standard fighting style, his arms and hands are also strong - and dexterous - enough to wield ten full-sized blades simultaneously. Kuro is also shown to have some level of endurance, able to recover from multiple blows from Luffy and even a massive rock to the face, only finally being knocked out with a heavy blow from Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Kane to the head. In combat, Kuro combines his natural agility with a variety of attacks, including kicks that can launch an opponent several meters away. Though he possesses no special defenses, he is highly skilled at reading enemy movements and dodging accordingly. The Nukiashi (, Nukiashi?, lit. \"Stealth Foot\") is Kuro's signature technique, a maneuver combining speed and stealth for nigh-undetectable movement. Using it, Kuro easily outmaneuvered a combined attack from Sham and Buchiand, according to Jango, could ambush and kill fifty skilled assassins without being noticed. This is called Pussyfoot Maneuver in the Viz Manga and FUNimation dub, and Stealth Walk in the 4Kids dub. (In the anime, this move is always visibly preceded by several rapid foot movements within a haze of dust. While predating the manga's introduction of the Rokushiki, it nevertheless evokes Luffy's observation that the basic principle of Soru is to stomp against the ground ten times within one second.) Kuro's preferred weapons are the Cat Claws, a pair of furred gloves with full-length katana blades at the end of each finger. Combined with Kuro's physical abilities, these claws can easily tear apart human bodies, and even masses of solid rock; most notoriously, Kuro singlehandedly killed an entire ship of Marines with them. According to Jango, wearing these claws caused Kuro to develop his habit of adjusting his glasses with the heel of his hand. That he retained this habit throughout his \"retirement\" was regarded as proof that even three years of domestic living could not dull his innate savagery. It has been stated in the manga and anime that Kuro gets empowered and more bloodthirsty while a crescent moon is present.[citation needed]"},

He is a great lover of alcohol, and often encouraged Dalton when both were still officials to have a drink with him instead of addressing problems within the kingdom. Kuromarimo was able to work very well with Chess, since both shared similar characteristics and ideas. Compared to Chess, however, he proved more lenient towards Dalton after his rebellion.

He has some endurance, having taken a surprise blow from a lapahn, which is powerful enough to drop trees, and quickly got back up. He uses a pair of boxing gloves and he showed that he is a powerful boxer. Kuromarimo has the ability to do many tricks with his afros, from ejecting spikes from them to shooting them off and using them to constrict opponents."},
{"name": "Kureha", "episode": "Episode 134", "chapter": "Chapter 81", "year": 2000, "note": "Also known as Doctorine.", "appearance": "Kureha is a slender woman whose exceptionally advanced age shows in her well-wrinkled face. She dresses in a style more suited to women one-seventh her age. This includes a navel ring, a shirt that bares her midriff, a purple blazer and purple low-riding pants. She has a pair of small sunglasses that, when they are not over her eyes, she wears on her forehead even when she is using glasses. She wears bracelets and rings on her left hand. In the past, she wore her hair in bunches with pink ties. Her pale yellow shirt had an alternating solid green line and purple dotted line pattern. During the Drum Island Arc, she wore pants with a pink design on the left leg and a blazer with a yellow line along the shoulders and down each arm. She wore a white shirt with a pink cherry blossom on the front and green sleeves and borders. When Dalton informed her of the Straw Hats' bounties after Enies Lobby, her blazer and pants were solid purple. Her blazer had a fur collar and trim, and orange shirt with a thin bull-head silhouette. Her belt buckle had either a sun or flower design on it. After the time skip, she does not look different from two years before. Her blazer had an orange flame pattern along the bottom and on the edge of the right sleeve. Her pants had the same pattern on the left leg. Her shirt had a top hat in front of an X (likely representing Hiriluk and Chopper respectively), which is the symbol of the Isshi-100. She was later seen wearing a shirt with a heart. In the Levely Arc, Kureha wears her blazer and pants, similar to her time skip outfit. She had a white shirt that said WANTED 100, a likely reference to Chopper's bounty.", "personality": "Dr. Kureha has often been called a witch for several reasons. The first is her eccentric treatment of patients, going as far as violently threatening them if they do not follow her orders. The second is her forceful method of checking for injury, for example, deliberately prodding the ailing area, causing her patients pain and then having Chopper knock them out as a form of anesthetic. The next is her age, 'only' 141. The final reason is her reclusive nature. She hates being called \"old\" or a \"hag\" and her response is generally to punch or kick the offender across the room, and often begins conversations by asking if whoever she's speaking to wants to know the secret of her youth. Kureha seems to have a drinking habit, judging by the bottle of plum sake (, umeshu?) that she always keeps close at hand. Kureha is extremely strict when it comes to healthcare, as she reprimanded Chopper for ignorantly poisoning Hiriluk, telling him that a miracle drug to cure all diseases does not exist and that medical knowledge and skills are what is truly necessary to save patients. When Nami stubbornly insisted on leaving despite not having fully recover, Kureha threatened Nami, saying she could only leave if she fully recovered or died. Kureha takes utmost pride in preserving her supreme health and constitution in her prime despite being a centenarian. She would frequently misunderstand people asking her for the secret of her youth during conversations as shown with Nami and later with Wapol at Mary Geoise. Thus, Kureha takes great offense to people calling her old or any term directly related to being called an elderly and would violently assault them in retaliation as shown with Sanji and Luffy. Kureha is also sometimes referred to as being a pirate because she takes whatever she wants as payment for her medical treatments. She apparently likes pickled plums, as stated by Dalton. Despite her cold demeanor, she does have a loving side to her personality, as she considers Chopper a son and was gravely depressed when Dr. Hiriluk died. Kureha also appears to be incredibly thoughtful, carefully deducting Luffy having the initial D would make him a dangerous man, and being able to correctly say the Pirate King's real name as Gol D. Roger rather than Gold Roger. She then showed some familiarity with the Will of D., which made her the first person in the series to mention it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Dr. Kureha possesses genius skills and immense medical knowledge as one of the finest doctors in the world. Her understanding of medicine and the art of healing is exceptional even among the medically advanced doctors of the Drum Kingdom, living well beyond the normal human life expectancy unaided while also retaining an immensely robust health at the same time. She managed to create an antibiotic to cure Nami when she was bitten and infected by the ancient tick, Kestia, which was thought to be extinct, and as such, the cure would be difficult to find. She is also one of the few doctors around the world authorized to use the highly restricted drug, NHC10. She passed on many of her skills and knowledge to Chopper, who became a great doctor in his own right. After establishing a medical academy, she taught and trained at least eighty students who became skilled enough to join the Isshi-20, expanding their members to a hundred under her leadership. She is also extremely good at telling temperatures, deducing Nami's exact temperature simply by poking her forehead with her index finger. Outside of her medical expertise, she possesses a significantly high level of superhuman strength and speed to match her vast longevity. She was shown to crush stone walls with ease and carry around and throw an entire arsenal of heavy weapons effortlessly.

His hair is tied into a straight ponytail. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the right side of his chest. Whether this tattoo covers a slave mark is currently unknown. Fifteen years ago, when he was part of the Sun Pirates, his hair was afro-like.", "personality": "Kuroobi is one of the strictest members in his crew and has always been wary of Nami's supposed allegiance to Arlong. Kuroobis attitude is similar to his captain, as he loathes all humans, but does not share Arlong's care for Nami as he dislikes and distrusts the navigator. He even searched her room for evidence he could use against her. Kuroobi does have respect for other people's strength, as seen with Arlong. Though he did complement Sanji's strength by saying he is above the \"average human\", he still mocked the cook for throwing his life away for one girl. Kuroobi is very cruel and unforgiving, as he sliced up Genzo for protecting Bell-mere for trying to rescue Nami, and later he mocked Sanji, saying he was too \"weak\" to protect Nami and his friends (though Sanji proved this wrong by defeating him). Kuroobi will take every advantage he can get in battle. During the Arlong Park battle, he punched Sanji through a wall when the latter was not focusing on the fight and tried to attack a weakened Zoro from behind. Kuroobi took advantage of Sanjis attempt to save Luffy by diving into the sea and promptly tortured the cook underwater due to his fish-man-enhanced ability while submerged. When Sanji turned the battle around by beating the karate fish-man to a pulp, Kuroobi was so furious he could not see straight, cursing the cook before being taken out. Like many other characters he has a unique laugh: \"Kuhahahahaha\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As a fish-man, Kuroobi possesses great strength. As one of Arlong's direct subordinates, he holds great authority over his crew. Kuroobi practices Fish-Man Karate to fight his opponents. He is a level 40 black belt practitioner of this martial art, causing great injury to Sanji in their battle. As a fish-man, Kuroobi has an advantage underwater. Kuroobi states his ultimate technique is Senmaigawara Seiken but it is unknown actually how strong this punch is, as Sanji beat Kuroobi into submission before Kuroobi actually executed the move. He is also an adept swordsman. Eight years ago, when Arlong was about to kill Bell-mre and abduct Nami, Kuroobi blocked the bullets from Genzo and swiftly slashed his body with a cutlass."},

{"name": "Kumadori", "episode": "Episode 375", "chapter": "Chapter 264", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Kumadori is a very tall man, standing exactly twice Nami's height pre-timeskip. He also has massive hands, a huge mane of pinkish hair, and a right eye that rarely seems to be open. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of mie poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of kabuki actors. Also, in one of the covers of CP9's Independent Report, Kumadori is shown to have four scars: two large ones on his torso and a pair of smaller ones on his left arm. Like other CP9 agents, he wears a black suit, black pants and a black shirt, but he also wore flip flops with green socks, a green tie, and hand guards covering the backs of his hands that were tied around his palm. As a CP-0 agent, he wears the same suit but the only difference is the color being white. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kumadori has been wearing his kabuki-style makeup since his youth and had his left eye closed instead of his right.", "personality": "Kumadori is, overall, an eccentric character, perhaps the most within CP9. He seems to honor the samurai code of honor very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even the faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses Tekkai, unintentionally saving his own life in a rather comical way. He thinks \"real men\" shouldn't cry or give up, which is why he kept fighting, even when confronted against Chopper's monster form. Kumadori also tried to keep Chopper from crying and from giving up because of his ideals. He also seemed to be the most obedient and dutiful of the CP9 agents as he was the only one who intervened to help Spandam while he was attacked by Franky and knocked the cyborg away from his superior, though he also ironically sends Spandam crashing in the process, causing him more injuries. Kumadori resembles a character in kabuki (traditional Japanese theater). He is a very loud character, and often punctuates his sentences with a loud, dramatic \"YOYOI!!\" He has a strange way of speaking, talks rather slowly and tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. He also has a penchant for spouting haiku, even during battles and at other inappropriate times. He often makes references to his \"mother in heaven\", Kumadori Yamanbako, then begins to sob, even while fighting. Before killing his opponents he often asks them to visit his mother in afterlife and tell her that he is okay. He claims her \"divine protection\" is the reason for his failure at committing seppuku. However, according to Oda in SBS Volume 44, his mother is still alive. Kumadori claims to be a sennin (?, a type of hermit in Japanese folklore who can control even their body's autonomic functions, as well as live forever), which explains his ability to suddenly gain or lose weight by controlling the digestion and absorption of food, and the ability to control his hair. He was also fond of his fellow CP9 agents as he helped raise money to pay for Lucci's treatment after his fight with Luffy and enjoyed spending time with his comrades at St. Poplar.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a full-fledged agent of CP9, Kumadori possesses great superhuman strength, with a Doriki of 810. His fighting style consists of combining his martial arts with his staff and bodily manipulation skills to increase versatility and destructive powers. After two years, Kumadori grew stronger as the World Government saw fit to reinstate him and promote him to CP0. Kumadori has mastered all six techniques of Rokushiki, having a Doriki of 810. He usually combines his skills with his staff and Seimei Kikan to increase versatility. As a hermit, Kumadori can use Seimei Kikan to control his bodily functions to his desire. His main style of combat is to manipulate his hair to grasp his opponents or compress them into hands. He can also allow himself to digest food in an instant and losing all the excess weight at once. Kumadori wields a staff, known as a Khakkhara (, shakuj?, literally meaning \"tin stick\"), which he uses in conjunction with his Rokushiki. He can utilize his superhuman strength to stab the blunt end of the staff with tremendous force, capable of shattering stone. He also carries a knife with a long blade and handle, strictly to commit hara-kiri with. The blade is quite resilient as it does not break when he instinctively uses Tekkai to protect himself from it. Kumadori possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

After two years he is seen in Yuba reading news about the Straw Hats. He has grown more muscular. He is wearing a short-sleeve shirt with black pants. He still wears the purple-tinted glasses and has desert goggles around his shirt collar. He also has a pistol attached to his belt and pair of gloves on his hands.", "personality": "One of the main characteristics of Koza's personality, which is reflected throughout the Arabasta Arc, is his love for his country, family and friends. He goes through a lot to protect what he values. As a child, he is seen willing to risk his own life to protect members of the Suna Suna Clan. As an adult, he stands for what he believes, leading a whole army with the aim to protect his country. Cobra took notice of his powerful belief in the country since Koza was a kid. When the two met again during the period of drought in Arabasta, Cobra remarked that he has not changed a bit from his childhood, which Koza also admitted himself when he prevented a young boy from joining the rebel army. A natural born leader, he was the captain of the Suna Suna Clan when he was a kid, and later took the head of the Rebel Army. He is seen to be quite influential to others, since he was able to lead an army of 2 million warriors to a battle against the Royal Palace. After the timeskip, he still holds an influential role as Environmental Minister of Arabasta. Courageous, he always tries to protect his friends, his village, or his country when he thinks they are in danger. As a child, he did not hesitate to attack a bandit who was threatening Vivi. This is valued from his friends and followers, who put their trust and love in him. Koza can also be characterized as short tempered and he does not hesitate to break rules if they go against what he considers just. This has led him to rebel against the king, against his father's judgment. However, his motivation is always pure and he only wishes for the prosperity of his country and the well-being of his friends. This is proved by his actions, such as his effort to stop the war between the royal army and the rebels, once he finds out the truth about the Baroque Works conspiracy.", "abilities_and_powers": "Koza has possessed great courage and leadership abilities since childhood; as an adult, he was able to raise and direct an army of millions against Arabasta's reigning monarch, and quell that same army with a single command. While his strength and speed do not appear to surpass that of an ordinary human, Koza at least possesses some incredible endurance and stamina, as he not only survived multiple gunshots to the torso, but was able to speak and fight less than a day afterward. Like all members of the Suna Suna Clan, Koza fought with a crude wooden club as a youth; despite his small size, he could swing it hard enough to knock out a grown man. As leader of the rebel army, Koza wielded several firearms as well as a sword; his swordsmanship, borne out of childhood training from Chaka, was competent if unremarkable. In his post as Environment Minister, he still carries a pistol at his side."},
{"name": "Kozuki Momonosuke", "episode": "Episode 684", "chapter": "Chapter 609", "year": 2012, "note": "He was first mentioned by Kin'emon in Chapter 658. His full name and true identity revealed in Chapter 817.", "appearance": "Momonosuke heavily resembles his father Oden (something that Shinobu noted), having a similar facial structure as well as the same long and wild mane of black hair (including on the top of his head which was shaven as an 8-year-old). Unlike Oden, Momonosuke's hair is not styled on the top of his head, being unkempt everywhere, and he currently lacks any facial hair. He is quite tall, with Shinobu and his sister Hiyori (who stand at 180 and 170cm respectively) reaching up to around his chest level. He wears a light-colored kimono with the Kozuki Family crest on it as well as a dark cloak lined with crescent moon designs, which is also a Kozuki symbol. In his prior appearance as an 8-year-old, Momonosuke matched the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a topknot and the top of his head shaven. While his unshaven hair was black like his father's, the portions of his hair that were shaven were turquoise like his mother's and sister's. Due to being a child, Momonosuke was quite short. His typical garb was a pink kimono with peach designs on it, matching his name (\"momo\" means \"peach\" in Japanese), as well as a pair of geta. During the Punk Hazard Arc, Momonosuke wore a red scarf and a purple obi.", "personality": "Due to his upbringing as a samurai, Momonosuke has a prideful and stubborn personality, as he was unwilling to communicate with the other kidnapped children. He also refused to eat any of the food or candy they offered him. Ironically, this attitude is what prevented him from getting poisoned by NHC10. Despite his pride, he also cried when he thought Kin'emon had died. Despite his tender age, Momonosuke is extremely dedicated to the samurai code of Bushido such as benevolence, courage, righteousness, and honor. Having immense compassion, Momonosuke cares dearly for the people of Wano and his retainers as well as other strangers. After learning of Caesar's evil intentions to sacrifice his test subjects, he wanted to warn his fellow captive children about it despite the dangers as he stated it will be shame as a samurai to simply run away. Momonosuke also aided the Straw Hats in treating the brutalized mink citizens of Zou. Momonosuke has great courage and selflessness. When Kanjuro ruthlessly attacked the Kozuki samurais, Momonosuke tearfully pleaded Kanjuro to stop. When he was abducted by Kanjuro, Momonosuke pleaded all of the Kozuki allies to continue their raid instead of rescuing him, telling them to prioritize saving Wano Country from Kaidou and Orochi's tyranny over his own safety despite the imminent danger. Momonosuke is proud of his family as he claims that he is the man who will become the Shogun of Wano Country. He also claims that he is not afraid of anything and even threw a fit when Luffy asked him if he is afraid of heights. However, he is terrified of Doflamingo after having witnessed his cruelty. Despite his pride and stubbornness, Momonosuke did not deny his fear of him. Momonosuke gained his acrophobia after being traumatized by Kaidou, who had held him by the throat, threatening to kill him by throwing him off the top of the Kuri Castle. Before that, he was completely fine with heights, having even traveled to and descended from Skypiea. He was able to overcome his acrophobia after biting Kaidou, the original source of his fear. Momonosuke loves his parents dearly and bears immense hatred and resentment towards Kaidou for murdering them. Momonosuke was also utterly frustrated at his powerlessness for not being able to avenge his parents or protecting his retainers. His immaturity and emotional outbursts initially prevented him from assuming authority, but after being spurred on by Luffy, Momonosuke has begun learning to take charge and fulfill his role as the Kozuki Family's leader. Momonosuke is also very sharp for his age as despite desiring to reunite with his sister, he understands the danger of Orochi learning of her whereabouts and thus opted to search for Hiyori after Orochi's defeat. Despite his pride, Momonosuke also has a humble and modest side as he willingly acknowledged his lack of strength and abilities to avenge his parents. Thus, Momonosuke became dedicated to trained relentlessly in order to be strong and overcome his weakness. He is also deeply impressed with Luffy for being able to convince the Udon prisoners to rise up and fight the Beast Pirates oppression, noted that he could never do the same, though was greatly enraged when Luffy agreed with harsh insults. When the Udon Prisoners bowed before him being elated for his safety, Momonosuke had already realized it was because they saw his father's image in him rather himself as a person. Having long realized his weakness and inferiority to his father Oden, Momonosuke also refused to accept his father's heirloom Ame no Habakiri due to believing he is still not capable enough to inherit it and thus asked Hitetsu to continue to hold on to it. Despite his age, he seems quite interested in older women such as Robin and Nami and has used a combination of fake innocence and flattery to get the women to treat him maternally, allowing him to get away with things for which grown men would be considered perverted. While it initially appears he really is just innocent, the look that he gives Kin'emon, Brook, and Sanji makes it clear that he knows what he is doing, clearly showing an extremely perverted nature on his part. His perverted nature is a trait that he inherited from his father who had influenced him while he was a toddler. Since acquiring his Devil Fruit powers, he has a peculiar habit of transforming into his dragon form whenever he is afraid, such as when Doflamingo was approaching the Thousand Sunny or being presented his father's sword Ame no Habakiri.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the heir of the Kozuki Family, Momonosuke has authority over its retainers, the Nine Red Scabbards. Due to this, he is one of the main leaders of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, which would not have formed without him requesting Luffy and Law's assistance as their equal. As two of his retainers are the Mink Kings Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, Momonosuke also has sway over the Mink Tribe, a race of powerful warriors who are very loyal to his clan to the point that they would die for any member or retainer. As the leader of the Wano recruits of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, Momonosuke technically holds authority over said recruits. It was also mainly thanks to his presence that the majority of the Wano recruits from Udon joined the alliance in the first place. However, being still young, he barely uses said authority, entrusting most of it to his loyal retainer Kin'emon. As the current shogun, Momonosuke has complete control over Wano Country. He restored Wano Country back to its former glory by demolishing all of the toxic factories and the wells for good water as well ceasing slavery for good. Like his father before him, Momonosuke has the ability to hear the Voice of All Things, He was able to communicate with the giant elephant Zunesha as well as see through its eyes and give it orders, which is the only way it can do anything but walk. Should Momonosuke order it to attack, he is in command of a powerful weapon capable of wiping out entire fleets in a single blow. He also has a sort of telepathic link with Luffy, as when the pirate was drowning in the ocean after getting beaten by Kaidou, he reassured Momonosuke that he will come back and defeat the emperor no matter what. Although he has shown none of the inhuman strength his father had as a child, Momonosuke did manage to survive taking a brutal beating from Kanjuro; this surprised the samurai, who attributed it to Momonosuke having Oden's blood. This was shown further after Momonosuke was turned into an adult; he felt no pain after being struck by Hiyori and Nami, and appears to have inherited his father's toughness. Momonosuke had learned basic swordsmanship from his father at very young age. Although Momonosuke has been seen in possession of swords, he has not been seen wielding them in an actual fight. Therefore, his level of skill in wielding them is unknown. After their return to Wano, he is seen practicing in his swordsmanship on different occasions, but he still did not see himself as worthy enough to wield Ame no Habakiri. Momonosuke is later seen training and receiving advice from Zoro during the three-day period before the raid on Onigashima. While being tied up by Kanjuro, Momonosuke was able to utilize a knife he found on the ground to cut himself free from his ropes. Although he proceeded to be easily overpowered by the samurai, Momonosuke did manage to cut Kanjuro's palm with the knife during their scuffle. Momonosuke ate Vegapunk's man-made copy of the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu; created from Kaidou's Lineage Factor which was altered by the original Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, but was deemed a failure by Vegapunk solely due the incorrect coloration of Momonosuke's Dragon form. It transformed Momonosuke into a serpentine dragon which allows him to seemingly fly by producing Flame Clouds (, Homuragumo?) that he was able to grab onto and climb up that way. However, as he has only eaten this fruit recently, he does not seem to have much control over it yet, and in fact, transformed unwillingly into his full animal form shortly after consuming the fruit. He did not know that he could produce and climb Flame Clouds, as he told Luffy he was stuck in the garbage dump when they met there. This changed, however, once he was turned into an adult dragon by Shinobu and met Yamato during the Raid on Onigashima, as he would explain the full capacity of his Devil Fruit to him once they were in need of his power. This led to Momonosuke using the Fruit's powers to create and manipulate the clouds in the same way Kaidou did and utilizing the ability to grab and pull the clouds. He would later master the ability as he was seen grabbing the clouds engulfing Onigashima to stop the island from reaching the Flower Capital. When he was frightened by a hunger-induced hallucination, he unconsciously used his cloud ability to escape with Luffy clinging to him. He also did not know he could switch forms until Luffy told him. It is also possible, though, that he has no conscious control over his power due to inexperience, as well as being artificial. He showed the ability to revert back to his human form when he reunited with Kin'emon. However, Momonosuke is shown to switch forms from time to time. When Momonosuke transforms, he does it in a poof of yellow smoke or clouds, with the change being nearly instantaneous, which is unlike other Zoan users, who physically morph into their bestial forms. When Momonosuke was aged into an adult, his dragon transformation was shown to be almost identical to Kaidou's in appearance, save for his size, horns, and skin color. He likewise gained a massive increase in his strength and durability, as he could easily smash through walls by simply crashing into them and is able to hurt Kaidou, in his dragon form, with a bite. He gained better control over his ability to produce Flame Clouds, being able to use them to fly at high speed. However, his acrophobia still affects him, making it mentally difficult for him to properly fly, causing him to need to close his eyes so he will not be scared by how high he is. After confronting Kaidou and overcoming his weakness, he is able to fly around without much issue. Doing so to grab ahold of Kaidou's Flame Clouds and attempt to pull back Onigashima away from the Flower Capital. During the battle against Ryokugyu, Momonosuke managed to perform Kaidou's Bolo Breath, and succeeded in damaging the Admiral's wooden form. Momonosuke possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. His, in particular, has been noted to be rather developed, as shown on in the Wano Country Arc, during the Raid on Onigashima, where he sensed how Luffy was performing against Kaidou and Big Mom, surprising Shinobu and Yamato, because of the amount of detail behind it."},

After successfully swindling her victims, she treated them very coldly without any compassion or remorse, saying that she despises the poor. However, it was later revealed that the men she swindled were guilty of highly immoral acts, and she passed all the money she swindled to Denjiro for him to distribute to the poor citizens of Wano rather than keeping it for herself. In reality, Hiyori is an extremely kind and compassionate woman. She is kind to those she is close to, such as her kamuro Toko, and she was appalled when Orochi attempted to attack her, given that she is a child. She is deeply sympathetic towards the many citizens of Wano who had been cruelly oppressed by Orochi and Kaidou. She broke down crying uncontrollably after Yasuie was executed. Despite her kindness, Hiyori has the desire to kill Orochi as she is not afraid to get her hands dirty. While being chased by Kamazo, Hiyori let go of her prideful attitude, pleading for Zoro to help her and Toko. She is very gracious, as she was extremely grateful to Zoro for saving her and made good on her offer to feed him in return. She can be rather careless and timid. She can be a tease, asking Zoro if he was happy to be sleeping with her. Hiyori has a deep love for her country, as she is willing to give up her father's heirloom Enma to Zoro in exchange for Wano's national treasure Shusui in order to return it to the country. Before Kawamatsu and Zoro left to rejoin their comrades to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, Hiyori sincerely bowed to the two, requesting them to do their best in saving Wano from their tyranny. Hiyori loved music, having enjoyed playing the shamisen since childhood. According to Kin'emon, she was a tomboy when she was a child and was quite insolent and brash, a trait she inherited from her father when he was young. Momonosuke stated that Hiyori liked to act tough, but she was quite a crybaby. Even as an adult, Hiyori retained some of her childish personality when she dropkicked her brother, Momonosuke. In her role as Komurasaki, Hiyori used speech patterns typically associated with oiran: She ended most of her sentences with \"de-arinsu\" (?), a polite expression meaning \"to be\", and used the first-person pronouns wachiki () or achiki (). After abandoning the Komurasaki identity, she drops the verbal tic and switches to the neutral pronoun watashi ().", "abilities_and_powers": "Hiyori seems to have great balance and leg strength to walk with extremely tall geta sandals without any strain, although she did have to put her hand on her guard to do so. She also owned a fair amount of arm strength, as she slapped the extremely large Orochi with enough force to leave a mark. As a child, she is already strong and agile enough to perform drop kicks on her brother. Hiyori has shown to be an extremely crafty manipulator, using her beauty in conjunction with superior acting skills to deceive some corrupt men into giving her all their wealth. With Denjiro's assistance, she was able to fool Orochi and all those who attended the banquet into believing that she died by carrying fake blood packs. During the raid on Onigashima, while Orochi carelessly listened to her music, she secretly placed a Seastone nail on him just so he will not transform. Ever since she was a child, she practiced playing the shamisen, and continued to do so during her training as a geisha, proving herself to be an extremely talented musician. This was shown when she played a song so enchanting, it deeply captivated Orochi, his guests, and her fellow courtesans. Hiyori possesses some degree of medical skill, as she was able to treat a large shoulder wound Zoro got from Kamazo."},
{"name": "Kozuki Oden", "episode": "Episode 920", "chapter": "Chapter 910", "year": 2016, "note": "He was first mentioned by Kin'emon in Chapter 817. He appeared as a silhouette in Episode 893.", "appearance": "Oden was a large and very muscular man of towering height, standing in at 382cm. He had long, wild hair of black color that was notably gathered into a large, flat, circular plane at the top, and also included a prominent widow's peak and triangular sideburns. He had relatively sharp, black eyes whose inner and outer corners were marked by black jags going down and up respectively, and above a pair of prominent, highly arched eyebrows. He also wore red eyeliner around his eyes, making them look even sharper. He had a mid-sized, slightly hooked nose, a large, expressive mouth, and a broad chin. Even during his late teen years, Oden looked just like a full-grown man. During his journey with the Roger Pirates, he received three scars, one on his leg, one on his arm, and one on his chest. During the five years before his demise, he grew a short goatee. For clothes, Oden typically wore an orange kimono, leaving most of his legs exposed; the kimono had two yellow crescent moon designs on it. Oden also wore a large purple and white nio-dasuki tied around his shoulders that ran down his back. He would often alternate between this and a similar longer kimono, with his nio-dasuki worn as a belt and tied in the front. Oden also wore his swords, Enma and Ame no Habakiri, across his left waist tucked inside an obi belt. While partying with the Whitebeard Pirates, he wore a light-colored shirt, dark colored pants, and a crown on his head.", "personality": "Oden was an extremely brash, confident, carefree, and self-willed man. This motivated him to commit outrageous and violent actions for his own benefit during his youth and adolescence, such as fighting gamblers in a drunken rage, burning down the yakuza casino after being banned from it, and kidnapping women at night to form a harem in the mountains. Similar to his son Momonosuke, Oden was a pervert as a kid as he was regularly roaming the Red Light District at age 6 and spent the castle's money at the pleasure halls, not to mention forming a harem at the age of 15. However, that toned down over the years as he already grew out of that phase by the time, he became an adult. Overall, Oden was known for getting into a significant number of violent fights, and he cared little for the consequences of his actions, as he gladly stood his ground against the yakuza and the loved ones of the women when fighting broke out as a result of the two aforementioned incidents, making Oden a thrill-seeker, as he always loved getting into fights. Although most men were appalled by his actions, his attitude made him very attractive to women, including the ones he kidnapped for his harem, as they stayed with him willingly, even though they were always free to leave. After being sentenced to work in the quarries, Oden became less selfish and started acting to improve the lives of the Flower Capital citizens around him. However, these actions were just as outrageous and ill-thought-out as the ones Oden committed to benefit himself. The most notable example is when he attempted to help out the citizens during a drought by diverting a river into the city, which caused the city to become flooded. Additionally, when a Mountain God attacked the Flower Capital, Oden quickly went to action to try to deal with it and even took responsibility for causing the crisis in order to shift blame from Kin'emon, who caused the incident on accident. Oden seemed to often mean well but acted in ways that were reckless and potentially alienating to those around him. For example, to honor a deceased man he once knew, Oden cooked a pot of oden soup over his cremated remains to \"share one last drink\" with his former friend, much to the dismay of his mourning family members, although Oden then apologized to them for the disturbance. Unlike the other people in Wano, Oden didn't follow its strict rules and always did things to help others in his own way. He didn't care what others thought about him and also never wanted to be thanked whenever he helped others. Although many men blamed Oden for the Mountain God Incident, they secretly envied Oden for his carefree attitude because he's not bound by Wano's strict rules. After being exiled by Sukiyaki, Oden seemed to have found an outlet for his unconventional attempts at heroism, as he was able to bring peace to Kuri and rebuild its infrastructure in only two years. Oden was also extremely adventurous and wanted to illegally set sail away from Wano Country, viewing it as too cramped. In his youth, he viewed this dream as more important than preparing to succeed his father as shogun. In fact, Oden's determination to set sail was so great that he kept trying to do so 38 times by the time he was only 18. When Whitebeard constantly refused and tried to secretly set sail without notifying him, Oden jumped straight into the sea holding onto the Moby Dick by a chain, shocking the Whitebeard Pirates. Thus, Whitebeard imposed him an extremely difficult challenge which Oden readily agreed to accept it as Oden could brave through the harshest weathers and obstacles without flinching. After he officially joined the Whitebeard Pirates, Oden became immensely excited and curious when they arrived at every new island, learning new discoveries which were unknown to Wano, to the point he ended up recklessly throwing himself into danger. After sailing with the Roger Pirates, Oden became more mature and responsible, and decided that he wanted to succeed his father as shogun and open Wano's borders, to prepare for the return of Joy Boy, and because he wanted to change the entire world. Despite having a first bad impression of Orochi, who Oden considered nothing more than a \"creepy weirdo\", when Oden became a daimyo and Orochi frequently came to him and asked to borrow money from him, Oden always obliged despite never being paid back, doing so because he felt sorry for Orochi and out of respect for his relationship with Yasuie; something Denjiro constantly scolded him for. This makes Oden also a rather naive man as he was easily used by Orochi who approached him humbly and used Crocodile tears, which led Kaidou to call him a foolish lord later on, saying that Oden is mighty, but soft, like Gol D. Roger and Edward Newgate. Because Oden was a honorable man who always kept his word, he believed that Orochi would do the same and honor the agreement that Orochi and Kaidou would leave Wano if he humiliated himself for five years to save the hundreds of hostages and stop the kidnappings and killings of the citizens of Wano. Oden was always someone who would take all the burden on his shoulders as he was afraid that his family and the people, he cares about would get hurt if they get involved, especially after he learned that Momonosuke was attacked, and Toki hit by an arrow. Ultimately, that would indirectly allow Orochi to rise to power and turn Wano into a wasteland. Despite his rowdy behavior, Oden was an extremely compassionate man. While at first annoyed by Kin'emon and Denjiro acting as his followers, he still cared for their well-being and took them in. He also took in other people like the orphaned Izou and Kikunojo, the persecuted Kanjuro, and the lonely Raizo. After subduing the criminals and outlaws of Kuri, Oden chose to reform them rather than execute them as criminals. Oden did not tolerate discrimination, considering it a symbol of ignorance. He saved Kawamatsu, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi from being publicly humiliated and tortured, beating up the ones responsible for it. He also saw the three as helpless children rather than monsters and was amazed by their uniqueness. Additionally, Oden willingly gave up on his trial to join the Whitebeard Pirates when he heard Amatsuki Toki calling out for help, choosing to save her even if it meant he could not join their crew, even though he held onto the chain attached to the Moby Dick for nearly 3 full days and was about to pass the test. When Toki got sick and was forced to return to Wano in the middle of their voyage with Roger, Oden wanted to abandon his dream of going to the last island and instead go back to Wano with Toki and their children, so Toki had to threaten to divorce Oden to force him to continue the journey to the last island. When Oden learned how Orochi abused his power and authority as the shogun by enslaving Wano citizens for his tyrannical greed, including executing an innocent man along with his family for defiance, Oden was outraged and did not blame his retainers for attacking Orochi for the injustice he caused, as he personally stormed into the Flower Capital to execute Orochi himself. When Oden learned from Orochi how his family was unjustly persecuted for his grandfather's crimes and Orochi showed Oden a room full of hundreds of hostages to blackmail him, Oden accepted his demands of dancing naked weekly in the Flower Capital as an apology to the Kurozumi Family in exchange for protecting the citizens from Orochi's vengeance, including saving the hundreds of kidnapped citizens that were meant as a tribute to Kaidou. Oden was extraordinarily humble and impartial. Despite being the Daimyo of Kuri and son of the Shogun, as well as the strongest Samurai, Oden referred to everyone as his equal and despite the deeds and sacrifices he performed to help others, he didn't like getting any credit for them. When Ashura was grateful to Oden for showing him how peace looked like, Oden became annoyed, telling Ashura to stop being creepy. Oden cared greatly for his retainers and the citizens of Wano. He saved the Flower Capital and its citizens from the Mountain God despite the fact that the citizens threw stones at him and insulted him when he appeared. When Yasuie informed Oden about the lawless region of Kuri which even Oden's father considers as the \"cancer of Wano\", Oden became interested, travelled there by himself, and defeated every bandit in there in the span of a night, as well as saving all the innocent people who were still living there. He then brought peace to the hellish wasteland that is Kuri, building a village for the citizens to live in, and a Paradise Farm to feed them. Oden also saved Kawamatsu, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi from people who tried to set them on fire, took them in, and fed them, expecting no credit for it. When Oden and his retainers were short on food, Oden even refused to eat just so his retainers don't starve. When Oden was about to pass Whitebeard's test after holding onto a chain attached to the Moby Dick and having faced the many dangers and climates of the New World Ocean with no protection for three days, Oden heard a woman in trouble and let go to save her, willing to abandon his childhood dream for a stranger. After saving her and waking up the next day, Oden was more thankful to her for treating his wounds, not wanting any credit from her for saving her life from a bunch of kidnappers. An ultimate act of loyalty and selflessness, Oden sacrificed his own pride, honor, and reputation for 5 years to protect and save hundreds of hostages, as well as the entire civilization of Wano from Kaidou and Orochi's tyranny. Oden never explained the motivations for his actions to anyone, not even his wife, children, and retainers, willing to take the truth that he did it to protect and save them all, to his grave. The citizens of Wano who treated Oden like scum for those 5 years learned the truth only thanks to Shinobu, who spied on the deal between Oden and Orochi. In the end, Oden sacrificed his own life for his retainers, willing to go through hellish pain by holding up all of 9 of them on a plank for an entire hour while he alone was getting boiled alive in the oil during the Legendary Hour. Oden's favorite food was oden soup, which he cooked to feed his retainers during his journey around Wano and also after becoming the daimyo of Kuri. Oden was even proud to be named after his favorite food, declaring he was born to be boiled like oden soup as he died in a pot of boiling oil. Oden also loved to drink sake, having started drinking alcohol when he was only 8 years old. Like many other people, Oden had a unique laugh: \"Wahahahaha\" (?)", "abilities_and_powers": "As daimyo of Kuri, Oden had a large amount of power and influence over the region before his death. Being a former member of both the Whitebeard Pirates, as a former division commander, and the Roger Pirates, Oden was a tremendously powerful pirate with great influence on both crews. For several years after Oden's death, Whitebeard kept Oden's spot as the 2nd division commander vacant and noted to Portgas D. Ace, the new 2nd division commander, about the importance and significance of his predecessor, calling Ace arrogant for thinking he could take down Kaidou, a man that not even Oden could defeat. In truth, the only reason why Oden lost to Kaidou was because Kurozumi Higurashi distracted him before he could finish Kaidou off. Oden's strength left a great impression on Kaidou who, even 20 years after his death, regards Oden as one of the few people, such as the Emperors Whitebeard and Shanks, the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, and his former captain, capable of fighting him. His influence even extended toward the members of the Mink Tribe on Zou, with the leaders Inuarashi and Nekomamushi being members of the Nine Red Scabbards. The combination of Oden's tremendous combat skills and charisma earned him a significant reputation with his allies and associates, even post-mortem. The Mink Tribe was so loyal toward the Kozuki Family that all of them were willing to die rather than allow even one of Oden's retainers to be captured. Despite his many conflicts with the yakuza of Wano Country over the years, Oden's death greatly impacted its leaders, causing them to stage an unsuccessful rebellion against his killers. His combat prowess was seen at an early age, when he got into massive battles and altercations with powerful samurai and yakuza and survived, causing a high number of casualties over the years. Despite being frequently pursued by authorities in his youth, he was only captured once and eluded capture many times afterwards. One of his most notable feats was his restoration of peace to the formerly lawless Kuri, where he defeated the powerful Ashura Doji and the dangerous criminals who worked under him single-handedly, rounded them up and got them to work under him, including Ashura. Prior to this, he demonstrated vast skill during his time as a laborer by quickly rising to the rank of a chief stonemason in a quarry. As Oden admitted himself, he had no talent in sailing and navigation. Like Roger and Luffy, Oden had the ability to hear the \"Voice of All Things\", which his son also inherited. On the trip to Fish-Man Island, he could hear the voices of the Sea Kings alongside Roger and could also hear a voice while nearing Zou. As a member of the Kozuki Family, Oden inherited from his father the knowledge and skill to read Poneglyphs and write the ancient script associated with them. He was a capable philologist, able to inscribe Roger's message on the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell in the same ancient script, as well as decipher all the Poneglyphs the Roger Pirates had found, particularly the Road Poneglyphs, which proved vital in the Roger Pirates' success in locating and sailing to Laugh Tale. Oden was an expert in cooking his favorite Oden hotpot, having frequently cooked it to feed his retainers during his journey around Wano and also during his journey with the Roger Pirates. Oden even managed to use Katsuzo's cremation for cooking a pot of oden. Oden had immense physical strength since infancy, during which he flung his wet nurse across the room. At age four, he obliterated a bear by hurling a boulder at it. By adulthood, Oden could carry a giant carp that he caught at sea by himself and exerted enough physical power in his swordsmanship to clash with Whitebeard's Meito Murakumogiri. To match his tremendous strength, Oden also had an astounding tolerance to pain, as he could hold a hot pot with his bare hands. Oden was extremely agile and quick, as even at the age of 2, he could catch rabbits with his bare hands. As an adult, he could travel across the regions of Wano Country in no time and leap across a huge bridge. Oden had immense stamina, durability, and endurance, as he was able to fight against the criminals and ronin of Kuri joined led by Ashura Doji for an entire night alone with multiple wounds such as arrows sticking out of his body yet still came out victorious. In his fight with Whitebeard, Oden took a point-blank quake punch from Whitebeard straight to the face and was fine afterwards. Additionally, he held onto a chain pulled by the Moby Dick and faced the many dangers and climates of the New World ocean with no protection for three days before eventually letting go, more because he went to rescue Toki than due to exhaustion. When he washed ashore on an island afterward, he received slight treatment from Toki and slept for one night before getting up with exuberant energy, leaving Toki surprised about his tremendous recovery speed. Prior to his prime, when he met Roger and got hit by his Divine Departure (imbued with Busoshoku Haki and coated with Haoshoku Haki), Oden got back up immediately with only minor injuries. In his fight against Kaidou, Oden was hit by his Blast Breath not just once, but twice, and powered through them both times. As a testament to his monstrous strength and endurance, Oden was able to hold up all nine of his retainers, who are all very large, on a thick wooden plank while his lower half was submerged in a large pot of boiling oil for over an hour, which killed an average man in seconds despite getting out, an unprecedented feat that even impressed Kaidou. Oden survived the boiling even after the temperature had increased to over 700 degrees and continued to rise. Despite being near death, Oden could still muster the strength to throw all nine of his retainers far away from the execution site. However, it appeared that Oden reached his limit from this as Kaidou noted that his body was dead. Oden was an immensely skilled and powerful swordsman, having developed his variation of Two Sword Style, which Oden himself called \"Oden Two Sword Style\" (, Oden Nitry?, literally meaning \"Oden Two Sword/Blade Style\", VIZ: \"Oden Two-Sword Style\"). He had immense prowess and ambidexterity in dual wielding the legendary swords, Enma and Ame no Habakiri. According to Oden, Oden Two Sword Style is the greatest sword style. Even at age 9, Oden was already such a skilled swordsman that he waged war against the entire yakuza and was able to fight against them all by himself in the Flower Capital until the age of 10, when he was arrested for almost killing someone. At age 18, he could strike down the massive boar hailed as the Mountain God with a single attack. Although the Mountain God was cut in half by Oden's attack, Oden's attack did not kill the Mountain God nor the citizens that it devoured because the cut was so clean and precise that the severed parts of the Mountain God were able to be put back together. Oden defeated all of the outlaws and ronin of Kuri, including the region's most dangerous criminal, Ashura Doji (someone noted to be worth 100 men in battle), within a single night. In his fight with Edward Newgate, Oden was able to clash and trade blows with him and matched the force of Whitebeard's quake punch by using Tougen Shirataki. During his adventures with the Whitebeard Pirates, Oden easily sank a large pirate ship by cutting it in half. Due to his adventures with the Whitebeard and Roger Pirates, he was stated to have grown many times stronger compared to before, returning to Wano \"invincible and triumphant\". In his first encounter with Kaidou, Oden managed to clash with him on equal terms by using only one sword. In his final fight with Kaidou, Oden became the first to wound the nigh-invulnerable Pirate, whose durability was greatly enhanced by his transforming into a giant Dragon, permanently scarring him and sending him crashing into the ground. 20 years, after his death, Kaidou still acknowledged Oden as the Strongest Samurai, declaring that there would never be another Samurai who could match Oden. During the Raid on Onigashima, though four of his subordinates inflicted a simultaneous wound on him in the exact same spot Oden scarred him, he stated that it was still shallow. The closest person who came close to matching Oden was Zoro, who despite suffering severe injuries still managed to give Kaidou a second scar, in his Human-Beast form using his strongest technique; though he intended on knocking the Emperor off his feet, still earning his respects for the feat alone nonetheless. However, the swordsman was still lacking compared to Oden in terms of strength, because he still couldn't control Enma, who Oden could wield as if it were as light as a feather. Oden was among the very small number of people in the world, who could use all three types of Haki. In Wano, he, in particular, was stronger among their Samurai, as he could easily wield Enma, a Meito that drains its user's Haki to a near-fatal level from childhood. His father, Kozuki Sukiyaki complimented that no one other than Oden could tame Enma, leaving Zoro in awe, who wondered how he could wield it, despite how much Haki was drained from him, treating it as if it were as light as a feather. Oden possessed the ability to use Haoshoku Haki, a very rare form of Haki whose users are said to have the qualities of a \"king\". He has mastered Haoshoku Haki to the extent that he can render his targets completely unconscious. In his initial encounter with Edward Newgate 30 years ago, the sudden clash between them created a notable effect similar to lightning, as well as released a shockwave. This was also shown during his clash against Kaidou. While not shown in the manga, Oden used Haoshoku's more common effect in the anime once, making a bunch of Kaidou's subordinates faint. After an unconscious Luffy knocked out a bunch of Kaidou's henchmen with his Haoshoku Haki, Ashura Doji noted that Luffy used \"Oden's special trick\", indicating that Oden has used the more common effect of Haoshoku Haki at least once, though it is unknown when. Oden was an immensely powerful master of Busoshoku Haki, known as \"Ryuo\" in Wano. He is noted as being the sole samurai to tame the Meito, Enma, infamous for its gluttonous Haki draining properties, which even Kin'emon, the Nine Red Scabbards' fearless leader was afraid of wielding it. As a testament to this, Oden's mastery was superior to that of Roronoa Zoro, a powerful Swordsman and Busoshoku Haki user, who had his entire arm emaciated the first time, but managed to regain the absorbed Haki. It was such that during Enma testing Zoro, he couldn't satiate it without going all out, acknowleding that he was lacking compared to Oden. Even at age 18, Oden was masterful in using Ryuo, as he imbued both of his swords, hardening them and letting him cleanly bisect the enormous Mountain God with one slash. At age 29, Oden hardened his swords and then clashed against one of the 12 Supreme Grade Swords, Murakumogiri, which belonged to Edward Newgate, an immensely powerful Busoshoku Haki master in his prime. As a true testament to his prowess, Oden, at age 39, was able to severely injure and leave a massive permanent scar on the nigh-indestructible Kaidou, while in his dragon form, whereas Luffy using Boundman did not faze him in human form. In the anime, Oden showcased the advanced application of emitting Busoshoku Haki out from his blades during his battle against Ashura Doji. In the anime when Oden uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a red-colored flowing aura. Oden possessed the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Oden wielded two Great Grade-ranked Meito: Ame no Habakiri (the sword said to be able to cut \"heaven\" itself) and its sister sword Enma (the sword said to be able to cut to the \"bottom of hell\"), respective masterpieces of Wano's greatest swordsmiths Kozuki Sukiyaki and Shimotsuki Kozaburo."},
{"name": "Kozuki Sukiyaki", "episode": "Episode 911", "chapter": "Chapter 894", "year": 2018, "note": "He was introduced as Tenguyama Hitetsu in Chapter 912. His real name was first mentioned by Kin'emon in Chapter 920. They were revealed to be the same person in Chapter 1053.", "appearance": "Sukiyaki is a large man of slightly above average height. In his 40s and 50s while he was shogun, he had black hair which split into three tufts that pointed upward at the front, while the back was fashioned in a topknot. He had a small beard growing out of his chin which split into three prongs and a long, thin mustache which pointed upward on each side. He had thick eyebrows, prominent eyelashes, and a dark nose. He wore a light-colored kimono and a dark-colored robe which both had various flower patterns on them. In the present day, he possesses a wrinkly face and long white hair that reaches down to his back. In his Hitetsu disguise, he wears a red tengu mask which has an extremely long nose that grows and shrinks constantly. He wears a black jacket with green poofs along its inner edges over a light gray kimono with purple spots on the bottom. He also wears dark blue puffy trousers and extremely tall geta sandals on his feet.", "personality": "Sukiyaki appeared to be a strict and fair ruler, as he was willing to disown and exile his own son, Oden, for his violent actions. He appeared to be exhausted by and ashamed of his son's ways, calling them demonic. However, Shimotsuki Yasuie believed this was simply a sign of Sukiyaki's tough love for his son and a way to get him to mend his ways. Sukiyaki also seemed to appreciate order, as while he was not bold enough to attempt to establish order in Kuri himself due to how violent it was, he rewarded Oden with the title of daimyo when he brought peace to the lawless region. After being deposed and imprisoned, Sukiyaki was filled with great shame upon escaping, believing he had failed the people of Wano. He was so sorrowful over his failure to the point of considering seppuku, and following the Kozuki Family regaining the shogunate under Momonosuke's leadership, Sukiyaki has no intention of revealing his continued survival to his grandchildren or former subjects, even refers his late son and grandchildren with honorifics sama to prevent his true identity from being known to his grandchildren and the Kozuki retainers. Eventually he chose to reveal his true identity to his grandchildren and retainers on the condition that once he passes down his knowledge to his grandson, he will completely go back to his life of seclusion. As Hitetsu, Sukiyaki retained the same strict attitude, but his caring traits were more apparent especially when it came to his ward Tama. Sukiyaki is immensely protective over her and what little resources she has, and so got extremely violent against Luffy when he mistakenly believed the pirate was taking advantage of her. Later, Sukiyaki took watch over the recently orphaned Toko and brought her to the Fire Festival to cheer her up, assuring her that her deceased father will watch over her. As a swordsmith, Sukiyaki has deep respect for swords and also fellow swordsmiths, as he refused to let Luffy borrow his ancestor's famed masterpiece Nidai Kitetsu, believing it is sinful to handle Meitos so casually, though it is mainly because of Nidai Kitetsu's dangerous nature as a curse sword. He also dutifully safeguarded Kozuki Oden's swords Ame no Habakiri (which he crafted himself) and Enma in order to return them to Oden's heirs, Momonosuke and Hiyori. When he noticed Zoro wielding his creation Sandai Kitetsu and also Shimotsuki Kozaburo's masterpiece Wado Ichimonji, he told Zoro about their origins and about Hiyori's faith in Zoro's abilities which led her to entrust her father's heirloom to him. Sukiyaki is also a collector of beautiful girl kokeshi dolls and was quite proud of his collection; he reacted with loud shock when Robin disagreed with them being cute.", "abilities_and_powers": "As shogun of Wano, Sukiyaki had full control over the country until his rule ended. He was capable of bestowing positions of authority onto others, as shown when he made his son, Oden, the daimyo of Kuri. As a member of the Kozuki Family, Sukiyaki is a philologist who inherited his ancestors' skills and knowledge to read the Poneglyphs and write its language which he passed on to his son. Like his ancestor, Sukiyaki is an extraordinary master swordsmith. According to Hiyori, Sukiyaki's craftsmanship is on par with the legendary master swordsmith Shimotsuki Kozaburo. He crafted two Meito; Sandai Kitetsu and Ame no Habakiri, one of the 21 Great Grade Swords. He is also extremely knowledgeable of swords and their origins, able to identify a Meito on sight. Sukiyaki is a samurai and has great strength despite his old age, as he was capable of sending Luffy flying out of his home with great force. Sukiyaki has immense stamina and endurance despite his age as he could survive years of imprisonment by Orochi and later the harsh famine of Wano caused by Kaidou and Orochi's pollution of Wano, a considerable feat as countless Wano citizens have succumbed to hunger. Sukiyaki wields a world-renowned katana. His overall skills with it are unknown, but he was able to send Luffy crashing out of his home with great force without injuring him with the blade. He also owns the cursed Great Grade Meito, Nidai Kitetsu, though he does not use it and it was borrowed by Monkey D. Luffy."},
{"name": "Krieg", "episode": "Episode 45", "chapter": "Chapter 21", "year": 1998, "note": "He was first mentioned by a Marine in Chapter 44. He was formally introduced in Chapter 46.", "appearance": "Krieg is a large, muscular man, with purple-gray hair and distinct sideburns. During his encounter with the Straw Hat Pirates, his hair was clipped short, and a thick layer of gauze wrapped around his scalp (presumably stemming from his injures on the Grand Line, as his wanted poster indicates he once wore his hair long and wild). His attire features many fur-lined elements. The most notable aspect of Krieg's appearance is his golden armor, which is fur-lined like the rest of his attire. Consisting of a full-torso carapace, massive shoulder-plates (each emblazoned with his Jolly Roger), and arm-guards, it is Krieg's main offense and defense against his foes. It is loaded with a variety of weapons. Under those, he has a brown shirt, and his hands are covered by a pair of fur-lined gloves. He has a golden gas mask somewhere inside the armor, to prevent his deadly MH5 gas from affecting him. On casual occasions, his armor and mass is hidden behind regal attire consisting of a fur-lined coat (which seems to become his cape when he reveals his armor) over a yellow vest with black spots-like motifs. Around his thick neck there is a big golden chain. He retains his pants and shoes even after taking off his clothes for battle, due to his armor not covering anything below the waist.", "personality": "Krieg showcases the typical attributes of a militant leader, favoring cruel and oppressive tendencies using a huge arsenal of weapons and overwhelming odds. He is incapable of any sense of honor nor can he be sympathetic for anyone. Krieg is characterized by cruelty, dishonesty, and arrogance. He is confident in his own superiority, despite any failures he might experience, and believes wholeheartedly that his armada and arsenal of weapons can overcome any foe. Even in the face of his obvious inferiority, Krieg refused to accept or learn from his mistake, instead turning to underhanded methods to get by and believing that there was some sort of trick to overcoming such foes. Witnessing Dracule Mihawk's devastatingly powerful swordsmanship, Krieg accused him of simply having a Devil Fruit power. Krieg has also proven to be very hypocritical as he chastises his crew for taking offense to Luffy calling them weak saying only a weakling is offended by words, but becomes angered himself when Luffy directly says he doesn't have what it takes to be King of the Pirates. However, his constant victories and reliance on weapons and odds made him overconfident. His superiority complex makes it very easy for him to lose his temper if his orders are not fulfilled, usually taking it out on his subordinates. This led to his failed attempt to conquer the Grand Line, believing his reputation built on sheer numbers and military weapons were enough to get him by; he suffered an utter defeat when Mihawk almost completely annihilated his entire fleet. Krieg lives up to his nickname, \"Foul Play\", as he believes in winning above all else, and will stoop to any level to achieve it. An example of this was flying a white flag of surrender and posing as Marines to get the drop on them. Due to his philosophy, he considers concepts like pride and sympathy to be pathetic, and will go to any lengths to win, resulting in his willingness to kill subordinates who display such emotions, disregarding their loyalty and strength. He has no attachments to either his crew or his ships, immediately preparing to rebuild his fleet with the various pirate crews scattered in East Blue instead of mourning the loss of his previous one, and plotting to sink his own flagship to get a new one due to the damage it has incurred. His lack of morale led him to ungratefully assault the Baratie when they gave food to him and his starving crew, intending to take over their ship and kill all the chefs who remained. Intolerant of failure and loss, Krieg lost all hold on his composure when Luffy defeated him, and stood up to demand a rematch despite his critical injuries. Krieg keeps his crew together using fear. Despite how mad and ridiculous some of his orders may seem, his crew will follow them out of fear of death, which is another factor that limits their strength. Overall, he rules his crew with draconian might and expects utter obedience for his overbearing demands. However, some members, like Gin, have genuine respect for Krieg, while Pearl shares the belief trickery is the key to victory and survival.", "abilities_and_powers": "Krieg was considered (in military strength) the most powerful pirate in the East Blue and had a terrible reputation for his devious and deceptive tactics in piracy. Although Krieg had a lower bounty than Arlong (especially with the fish-man bribing the Marines to keep it low), his fleet of 50 ships and over 5,000 pirates, combined with active pillaging, forced the Marines to view Krieg as a greater threat in East Blue. Despite this, however, it was commented by Luffy that Krieg's fleet was not all that powerful. They were just using sheer numbers alone to overwhelm their opponents.[citation needed] Krieg also claimed to be the strongest man in the world, and while this is clearly a vast overestimation on his part, he is certainly formidable in physical combat, possessing massive physical strength. He could break Gin's arm with his grip, defend against cannonballs without moving an inch, and easily lift and throw the Sabagashira I a far distance into the Baratie restaurant with a single hand. He can also lift the one-ton Great Battle Spear single-handedly and swing it around freely while wearing his golden wootz armor. Krieg is also a sound tactician and expert strategist, realizing the material value of his subordinates and requiring them to be at perfect health, as well as using decoys and disguises to avoid unnecessary battles (such as disguising his flagship as a Marine vessel to enter village harbors easily, or dressing up his first-mate as himself to distract pursuers). His dishonest and unethical behavior, despite showing his lack of honesty, is a testament of his strategic aptitude. His plan to steal Baratie as a suitable replacement for his damaged ship due to its ridiculous and non-threatening appearance would prove crucial for his future pirate ambitions. He also has knowledge of Devil Fruits, as shown when he witnessed Luffy's ability to stretch and planned to throw him into the water in order to disable him, noting that the Grand Line is supposed to be filled with such people. However, Krieg's most potent weapon has always been his talent for trickery, which seemed to know no bounds. He lies and pretends to beg for mercy before striking when his opponents lower their guards. His methods have earned him the nickname \"Foul Play\". Krieg's fighting style is almost exclusively tied to his huge arsenal of weapons. True to his \"Foul Play\" moniker, he keeps most of these weapons hidden or otherwise inconspicuous until the exact moment he deploys them, counting on not only raw firepower but the element of surprise to overwhelm his foes. (Accordingly, Krieg \"names\" very few of his attacks out loud; most of his weapons are identified by onlookers, particularly his crew.) The centerpiece of Krieg's arsenal is his Wootz steel armor (, tsu-K no Yoroi?), bright gold in color. Reputedlythough, as Luffy eventually proved, not totallyindestructible, its carapace can withstand a point-blank bazooka shot without any hint of damage to either the exterior or Krieg himself. At the same time, it is flexible enough to permit Krieg considerable freedom of movement. Many of Krieg's weapons are directly built into this armor, chief amongst them a set of ten gun-barrelstwo beneath each shoulder-plate, and three beneath each of the carapace's waist-flaps. Through unknown mechanisms, Krieg can fire all of these in a single motion, allowing him to gun down dozens of enemies within seconds. Each of the shoulder-plates can be removed and used as bludgeons to augment Krieg's already-powerful punches. In addition, the left plate holds many projectile launchers: Finally, the armor features two segmented arm-guards made of plainer steel (, Hagane?), which Krieg can raise over his face at a moment's notice. These also boast built-in armaments: The deadly poison-gas bomb MH5 ( MH5, Mdoku Gasu-Dan Emu-eichi-faibu?) is Krieg's most dreaded weapon: an explosive shell containing a highly potent chemical toxin. Typically fired from the central launcher in Krieg's left shoulder-plate, its impact spreads a large cloud of gas that lasts around five minutes. The poison inflicts immediate organ failure and internal bleeding on anyone who breathes it unprotected and, according to Krieg, kills within an hour. As a precaution for its use, Krieg and his crewmen all carry gas masks. The gas is apparently harmless through mere skin exposure, as Luffywith a stolen maskwas able to survive with no ill effects even when his body was completely engulfed. Knowing it can destroy whole villages, Krieg uses this weapon sparingly. In fact, he has been known to bait enemies with a decoy that looks identical to the real shell, but explodes to scatter shuriken instead. The Daisenso (, Daisens?, literally meaning \"Battle Spear\") is Krieg's ultimate melee weapon, formed by locking his shoulder-plates against one another and activating internal devices that produce a shaft and a blade from between. In addition to its long reach, the spear's head explodes on impact with any solid surface, with heavier impacts produceing proportionally larger explosions; thus, even glancing hits or near-misses can wreak severe damage. To compensate for the blade's relative fragility, the explosive mechanism is stored primarily in the plates, allowing the spear to keep exploding even if the blade is completely destroyed. Beneath his gloves, Krieg wears a set of diamond fists (, Daiya no Kobushi?), metal gauntlets with a small diamond over each knuckle and a larger one on the back of each hand. Combined with Krieg's natural strength, these can shatter a full-sized mast in one blow. The Kenzan Mantle (, Kenzan Manto?, lit. \"Sword Mountain Mantle\"; Porcupine Cape in all English versions) is a secondary cape covered with fist-sized metal spikes. Normally stored under one of Krieg's shoulder-plates, it is used as a defense in close quarters, especially against foes that try to aim for his legs or head. Krieg carries at least two double-barreled pistols on his person. Used in conjunction with his armor's gun array, these bring his maximum rate of fire to fourteen rounds per second. During the first part of his battle against Luffy, he wielded a huge spiked flail on a chain, apparently unconnected to any part of his armor. While reasonably effective, Krieg apparently abandoned it after Luffy deflected it, temporarily knocking out Pearl. Also separate from his armor, Krieg carries a number of marble-sized bombs that can create powerful explosions even if thrown by hand. Krieg commonly scatters them in large numbers to destabilize the battlefield in his favor. Carne's account of Krieg's origins shows him with a sword."},

When she came to 30 years before the present, she showed an excited attitude at going to Wano. After she married Oden, Oden's retainers came to possess tremendous respect for her.

The last time she used it before her death was sending her son and some of her husband's retainers two decades into the future to save them from the Beasts Pirates. Toki carried a katana and pulled it out when confronting Karma and his gang, but seemed to have no intention of using it against them as she had planned to escape by traveling into the future; thus, it is unclear if she had any swordsmanship skill."},

Luffy was less than impressed with Koby's cowardice, describing him as \"pretty stupid and useless...and kinda wimpy too\". However, Luffy's boundless optimism and single-minded pursuit of his dream rekindled a similar conviction in the downtrodden ship caretaker, allowing him to defy his captors, even under the threat of a brutal death by Alvida's mace.

He was also shown to be perceptive, noting that it was \"strange\" for the citizens of Shells Town to be afraid of a Marine Captain and telling Luffy that he had \"a bad feeling about this.\" Koby's nave belief in the blanket integrity of the Marines was dashed when he witnessed the actions of Axe-Hand Morgan and his son, but it only strengthened his resolve to become, in his words, \"a real Marine.\" Under Garp's instruction, Koby's timidity has been replaced with confidence, although he remains polite, self-effacing, and apologetic if he feels he has done something overly ambitious (such as publicly stating his goal to become a Marine admiral). He continues to be an emotional, compassionate person who can easily be driven to tears for a variety of reasons, which led to Zoro jocularly calling him a \"crybaby\" during their reunion at Water 7. Koby does not act with the reckless bravery that many characters in the series exhibit, but rather on moral compunction. He has put his life on the line at least twice for the sake of what he feels is right, most notably at the Summit War of Marineford where he brought fighting to a standstill by facing down Admiral Akainu and bought the precious seconds needed for Luffy to escape Koby has an immense amount of determination. In the early days of his training as a Marine when he was still weak, he would trained relentlessly non-stop by punching battleships which could only be done by powerful Marines such as Garp and Kuzan due to acknowledging his lack of fighting talent. Despite his already exhaustive training session with Garp, he continued to train on a daily basis despite his hands would keep bleeding from the injuries. For all he has done and is capable of doing, Koby is rather humble, as he denied Kyros' claim of him being a hero during the Rocky Port Incident and did not claim credit for stopping a torpedo that was aiming at the Dressrosa and Prodence Kingdom ships. He felt ashamed for thinking Marines had come to rescue him and considered it thinking that the world revolved around him when trying to escape from Hachinosu, and was shocked when he discovered they had come for him.", "abilities_and_powers": "In his first appearance, Koby lacked any fighting skills, let alone even above-average physical prowess. According to Alvida, the only reason she kept him around was because he happened to be good at navigation. He gained some fighting skills after he trained under Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp, alongside Helmeppo, learning the Rokushiki, surprising Luffy and Zoro from the amount of growth he'd undergone. After the two year timeskip, Koby reached the rank of Captain, granting him command over lower-ranked Marines and charge of his own ship. In addition to this, at some point he became a member of the covert Marine squadron SWORD, who are granted enough free reign to take on missions normal Marines could not, including challenging any of the Four Emperors. At some point, he became regarded as a \"Hero\" because of the Rocky Port Incident, somehow assisting the Emperor, Blackbeard in defeating Ochoku, a former member of the Rocks Pirates and a famous pirate comparable to Shiki and Captain John. During the Marines' invasion of Amazon Lily to arrest the former Warlord, Boa Hancock, Koby was one of the few people to not get petrified by her powers: a notable feat as Yamakaji, Catarina Devon, Vasco Shot, a Vice Admiral and two of the Blackbeard Pirates' Titanic Captains were among the Marines and Pirates to be petrified. After the Cross Guild placed bounties on Marines, his was 500,000,000, most notable as most Marine Captains are worth 100,000,000. He has some knowledge of swordsmanship, as he was seen practicing with Helmeppo and Bogard. Due to his harsh training regimen under Garp, Koby has developed a high physical prowess, such as strength and speed, capable of pulling off one of the Rokushiki techniques, Soru, momentarily surprising and kicking Luffy before he could react, as well as avoiding his punch. As with his mentor and Kuzan, to make up for his lack of talent when he was still weak, he would often use retired battleships as punching bags, often doing so every night after finishing training with Garp despite suffering the intense pain and continously bleeding his hands, all while not using Haki to build up punching power; where at some point, like those powerful Marines, he'd become capable of caving in the armored hulls. After the two-year timeskip and mastering Rokushiki, Koby displays more impressive physical prowess for a Marine Captain, showing himself to be an excllent swimmer, catching up, then redirecting a torpedo barehanded within seconds. Most notably, he has proved himself to be strong and durable enough to be the last Marine standing up against the former Warlord, Boa Hancock, and the Emperor, Marshall D. Teach, having also been involved in somehow aiding the Emperor defeat former Rocks Pirate Ochoku. While on Hachinosu, despite still being chained to an iron ball and still recovering from the previous battle on Amazon Lily, Koby could free the captured people and escape from numerous pirates attacking him. A testament to his developing punching power, a Haki-enhanced punch was powerful enough to break apart Avalo Pizarro's island hand, a feat almost comparable to that of his mentor. In Episode of Luffy, he shattered a gigantic metal disk with a single punch and performed Rokushiki techniques with great ease. Since his training with Garp, Koby has become strong enough to use at least one of the Rokushiki, the Soru technique. He has used Soru against Luffy twice: once at Water 7 and once at the Summit War of Marineford, although the technique did not help him win either fight. After the timeskip, Koby has mastered his Rokushiki techniques. In One Piece: Gigant Battle! 2 New World he is also capable of using the Geppo and Rankyaku techniques. In Episode of Luffy, he shows to be able to use a technique similar to Rankyaku, but this was done with his arms. During the Summit War of Marineford, Koby awakened Kenbunshoku Haki. Koby was shown hunched over and crying intensely on the battlefield, saying that the voices in his head were disappearing one by one as the combatants around him were slain, much like what Aisa felt during the Skypiea Arc. After the timeskip, Koby had developed his Kenbunshoku Haki to a very advanced level. He was able to notice a torpedo headed towards the Dressrosa-Prodence Kingdom ship underwater from his own ship a ways off, shocking Helmeppo, who did not notice it despite having Kenbunshoku Haki as well. On top of that, Koby also managed to sense Kyros's great strength despite just meeting him. Koby is an extremely skilled Busoshoku Haki user. At Hachinosu, an almost exhausted Koby hardened his fist to break apart Avalo Pizarro's gigantic hand, preparing to crush their escaping battleship, which carried civilians and comrades. Furthermore, he proved skilled and powerful in the advanced application of emitting Haki without a medium, resulting in him blasting apart the Ten Titanic Captains' gigantic island hand. Such a feat of Busoshoku Haki sparked immediate astonishment from the Marines, SWORD members, and Blackbeard Pirates, some of which included Devil Fruit users and combatants who fought powerful opponents."},

During Luffy and Cracker's battle, the top of Kingbaum's head was cut off, removing most of his branches. When the Big Mom Pirates' army attacked the Straw Hats, Kingbaum was bisected vertically by Amande. However, he was later stitched back together.

{"name": "King", "episode": "Episode 925", "chapter": "Chapter 918", "year": 2018, "note": "He first appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 920.", "appearance": "King is a towering man at 613 cm tall, with a well-muscled, broad-shouldered frame and long limbs. Being a lunarian, he has his race's telltale features: large, black-feathered wings on his back that reach down to knee length, a brown complexion, and silver-white hair. Said hair is shaved on the sides but kept long on top, where it is mostly drawn back and bound at King's occiput before flowing freely down past his nape; some sidelocks hang down on the right of King's face, to his collarbone, and include a thin braid. King's face is characterized by his narrow red eyes, prominent dark eyebrows, a straight nose, prominent lips, and a square, stubbly chin. Circling halfway around his left eye, on its outer side, is a black tattoo resembling a laurel wreath or olive branch. In addition, a plume of fire constantly rises from King's upper back, also owing to his heritage (though it may extinguish), and when King transforms into a pteranodon, these flames further engulf his back and wings while his natural lunarian wings are replaced by his pterosaur ones. When being dealt the finishing blow by Roronoa Zoro amid the conclusion to their fight, King had half his right wing sliced off. In order to hide his lunarian identity, King keeps himself clad in a dark, form-fitting leather uniform that bares no skin. Covering his head and neck area is a full-faced leather mask, which leaves only two holes for his eyes and has a zipper going up the front of the neck, flanked by two blue, gray-studded leather bands. The mask around the eyes is black, with a trio of blue strips below (also beset with studs) forming a triangle to mark off the nose, mouth, and chin section, and to the sides of which is blue leather of flame-like shape. Topping the eyes are blue-lensed, gray-rimmed goggle pieces, and on either side of the mask, connecting with a studded base, is a large and black, horn-like spike. Five more such spikes, only smaller, are located further on top upon a blue band that runs coronally into another one positioned like a headband, and crossing yet another that goes sagittal, with airholes in-between. Otherwise, King's upper-body wear includes a dark-blue, double-breasted leather jacket that has ten gold buttons and notch lapels with square, red, gold-edged skull patches sewn on. Running straight down each side of the jacket's waist are two columns of yet more studs, and flat, two-part shoulder pads (black and double-trimmed with studs) are present on each side, down the upper arms with three curved spikes atop (the outer spikes the biggest). The tight sleeves of the jacket are cuffless, end in black gloves, and each bears an additional, stud-covered pair of leather bands above thinner strips, plus three very small, white spikes above the wrists. Below the jacket, King wears a white shirt whose ruffled neckline emerges from under the jacket's lapels. For lower wear, King dons dark-blue pants matching the jacket, with three studded leather bands wrapping around each upper leg and a ring of the same material located on either knee. The pants go inside black, high-heeled boots (once again tied with studded straps), the high shafts of which end folded over, in studded jags. As a young boy, King had already begun keeping his hair longer and swept to the right. At one point he wore a light-colored shirt patterned with alternating dark squares along the borders, plus dark shorts and light boots, and wielded a plain, qing-like spear that featured a leaf-shaped blade with a short tassel lashed below. Years later while held in World Government captivity, a teenaged King had already grown very tall by human standards, reaching up to an adult Kaidou's waist. His hair was at roughly neck length, his wings were proportionally smaller (their lower end reaching only to waist level), and King's fire was already present at his back, as was the tattoo around his eye. King's clothes at the time consisted of a light-colored shirt and dark pants, and he already seemed to be equipped with a flaming sword. Years following his recruitment by Kaidou, King had already begun attiring himself in a version of his current leather uniform, being seen with his mask off while in the company of Kaidou. Twenty years ago, King wore a version of his uniform that, in the anime, is shown to have had a dark-red coloration as opposed to blue. King's spikes atop his mask were shorter, blunter, and he wore his jacket's collar upturned without white ruffles visible. The jacket's front had just one row of buttons, with two golden cross shapes right there that either served as oversized buttons or were simply patches. Also in the anime, King was seen carrying a blue-flamed torch.", "personality": "King is a stern, reticent man who keeps a level head in most situations, rarely showing strong emotions (though this is partly attributable to his face being perpetually masked). Like Queen, King tends to be very denigrative towards crewmates, such as frequently insulting and deriding his fellow All-Stars for perceived failures. In keeping with his status as Kaidou's right-hand man, King has shown himself to be not only calm and stoic but proactive and good at making major decisions under pressure. He personally engaged Big Mom and her crew to keep them from entering Wano, despite not being ordered to do so by Kaidou, and later in Big Mom's presence showed himself not to be intimidated by her in the slightest, despite his surprise at her survival, bluntly refusing her offer to join her. King also took the initiative to summon the Tobiroppo after hearing Kaidou was looking to address a problem with Yamato, acting conniving by framing the summons as one from Kaidou due to knowing that the Tobiroppo would not answer to him. When Kaidou became occupied with fighting during the rebel invasion of Onigashima, King was mainly the one to handle their crew's troops, calmly issuing orders. Strongly averse to the idea of showing his face and revealing his lunarian identity, King wears a head-enwrapping mask that leaves only his eyes visible; it was stated by a grunt of the Beasts Pirates that no one had ever caught a glimpse of King's face. When his mask took some damage in his fight with Roronoa Zoro, King flew into a silent rage, indiscriminately attacking enemy and crewmate alike (even his fellow All-Star) before taking care to relocate his battle with Zoro to someplace that had no one else around but them. Once King's mask was off completely and some close-by underlings of his recognized him as lunarian, the All-Star mercilessly disposed of them with his flames. Ultimately, however, King takes some pride in the biological strength of his race, boasting to Zoro that humans could not compare to lunarians. King has a sadistic side to him, having been called a \"torture-loving pervert\" by Queen (though likely in reference to his leather getup). In general, King appears to share Kaidou's streak of ruthlessness, having shown himself to be not above executing a child when demanding that Sanji hand over the eight-year-old Momonosuke for him to kill, in accordance with Kaidou's New Onigashima Project. He also had no scruples about personally dispatching turncoat subordinates who, in fact, had been brainwashed into betrayal. Likewise, while loyal to his crew, King has no qualms about betraying long-standing allies who stand outside their direct organization, especially if so doing is pertinent to Kaidou's plans, and so lent his sword to Kaidou so he could decapitate their ally Orochi whom they had played friendly with for over two decades. King seems to greatly respect strength in others, with Kaidou's immense power being what originally induced King to join his crew and place his trust in him. In combat, King has expressed his belief that one ought not to limit oneself to a single way of fighting, as there should be no need for adherence to any one school or style in a real battle. Generally, while King does admit to enjoying a good duel, the All-Star's stolid and no-nonsense attitude carries over into his fights: he does not bother with posturing, monologuing, or following fighting etiquette. Instead, he wastes no time in going for the kill should an opportunity emerge, personally goes after noteworthy enemies when physically disabled, immediately strikes at foes when distracted, and may relentlessly mount attack after attack on opponents to leave them little time to defend themselves or counterattack. Even more, King may goad enemies into attacking him to render them vulnerable to his own surprise counteroffense. King is among the scant few people who are aware of Joy Boy's supposed nature and, according to Kaidou, is waiting for the legendary figure to appear, with King having at one point speculated that Kaidou himself might be Joy Boy.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Beasts Pirates' head All-Star and Kaidou's right-hand man, King holds authority in the crew that is just below Kaidou's own, exemplified when he took on the role of a commanding officer during his governor-general's absence, informing the Tobiroppo of the enemy's numbers and directing them towards new objectives throughout the raid on Onigashima. In combat, King is shown to be extremely formidable, with his 1,390,000,000 bounty illustrating his fearsome reputation. A veteran pirate, he has been part of Kaidou's crew for over three decades, as his first recruit, and was in his youth acknowledged by Kaidou for having extraordinary strength, being named \"King\" in recognition of it. Like the other two All-Stars, King is also hailed as a \"calamity\" for his sheer destructiveness, linked to his pyrokinetic abilities. Alongside Jack, King was confident in his ability to defeat any of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest fighters of their crew behind the All-Stars and mighty combatants in their own right, if challenged. During the battle on Onigashima, King effectively engaged Marco, Whitebeard's former right-hand man, in single and later (with Queen) two-on-one combat, keeping Marco occupied until he ran out of stamina, all while King remained none the worse for wear. Later, King proved himself more than a match for Roronoa Zoroone of the Straw Hat Pirates' top fighters who had proven capable of injuring Kaidou himself. As King went toe-to-toe with and consistently overwhelmed the enemy swordsman in their duel, Zoro came to believe that, unless he figured out King's background, he would not be able to win. However, once Zoro had managed to figure out the secret of King's body and the means by which to hurt him, the swordsman was able to deal a decisive blow to the All-Star and defeat him. Having a strong will, King was completely unaffected by Zoro's Haoshoku Haki. Like his fellow All-Stars, King has a penchant for melee combat. His fighting style is a wild one, eschewing proper form and technique in favor of a savage yet practical mixture of swordplay, hand-to-hand combat, his Zoan transformation, and a lunarian's natural ability to emit fire. He has been seen disarming opponents with his swordbreaker-like katana to leave them vulnerable to follow-up attacks, while generally pairing punches and kicks with strokes of his sword. As a swordsman in particular, King has proven himself skilled enough to keep up with Zoro's powerful and versatile three-bladed fighting style, matching him blow for blow and overpowering him at certain points via brute force. King boasts massive physical strength. His feats include: easily hurling Shinobu with significant force after grabbing her by the head; repressing a Raid Suit-donning Sanji by grabbing his neck one-handed and blocking a powerful kick from the latter using his own leg (on top of, in the anime, blocking Sanji's Ryusei Osoba Kick easily with an open palm); slicing one of Marco's phoenix wings right off with a downward swipe of his sword (plus, in the anime, overpowering Marco with a single-handed grab of his head); overpowering Zoro's three-sword guard with a single sword swing despite Zoro's own superhuman brawn, violently blowing Zoro back in the process, and kicking the enemy swordsman away with great force. Being of lunarian descent, King is immensely resilient, with Queen calling him a monster that could survive in any natural environment. In his youth while held captive on Punk Hazard, King was able to survive all the \"endurance experiments\" conducted on him, such as being continuously burned alive, and could shrug off gunfire without a scratch. In the present, King has shown himself to be nigh-on invulnerable during fights, even without invoking his Zoan powers, and can take extremely potent attacks without being fazed or shedding a drop of blood. He has withstood powerful blows from the phoenix-bodied Marco, a direct hit from Zoro's Rengoku Oni Giri (an attack that defeated Killer), and Zoro's One Sword Style Iai: Shi Shishi Sonson (one of Zoro's strongest attacks that seemingly cut King from his head down the middle), all without King suffering any discernible damage. Even an enormous, fiery explosion coming off King's body left him completely unhurt, whereas Zoro admitted that he would have died to that same explosion had it not been for his Haki (though said explosion was possibly the result of King unleashing his own flames from within his body). However, once the fire on King's back goes out, his defensive power drops significantly; regardless, even in his less resilient state, King managed to endure a few of Zoro's Haoshoku Haki-infused attacks before being defeated and even survived his fall from Onigashima, while the island was high up in the sky. Otherwise, King is quite fast and agile despite his large frame, able to instantly cover a large distance in a single leap, and kept up with the signficantly smaller Zoro in close quarters despite the latter's own respectable speed. His speed is far greater when the flame on his back is out, allowing him to move faster than the untrained eye can follow at the cost of his natural durability diminishing. King is additionally able to fly using his feathery lunarian wings, without needing his Zoan powers. As a lunarian, King wields the natural ability to \"ignite\" any part of his body, allowing him to create and manipulate fire in both his base form and Zoan forms; it is this ability that garnered King his epithet as a Calamity: \"the Conflagration\". It is unknown if excessive use of his flames causes King any kind of drawback, but what is shown is that the flames on his back seem directly linked to his tremendous resilience as a lunarian: when they go out, King's bodily defense weakens considerably in exchange for a boost to his movement speed. Using the fire he conjures, King can strengthen his melee attacks, like throwing a flaming punch, kicking with a flaming leg to burn his foe or coating his sword in fire, can launch a gatling of flame bullets from a distance, and may set the surrounding battlefield ablaze. Moreover, King can seemingly allow his flames to build up within his body and may, when struck by an enemywhom he may goad into attacking the right spotrelease them at once to trigger an enormous, lethal explosion (unless the same feat was instead facilitated by some kind of explosive device hidden beneath his suit). King, thanks to his resilience, can endure said blast without issue while his foe will be helplessly exposed; when Zoro was caught in the explosion, he only survived by putting up a Haki defense. At their strongest, King's flames take on the consistency of magma, with King's strongest-seen fire techniques involving him channeling fire into his sword to generate massive, super-hot flame dragons that burn up whatever lies in their path. King ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pteranodon, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full pteranodon and a lunarian-pteranodon hybrid at will. When transformed, he is more clad in flames than usual and gains the ability to fly at extreme speeds. As with dinosaur-based Zoans, King's pterosaur form greatly bolsters his physical abilities, including his naturally impressive durability, and he can use his strong wings as a shield to defend from powerful attacks without sustaining injury. King's full Beast Form is strong enough to either violently push back or inflict significant damage upon whatever he flies into, be it people or massive objects, like an entire ship. King's long, sturdy, and pointy beak comes with immense piercing power, meaning that King can use it like a spear, penetrating stone buildings with ease. Furthermore, in his Beast Form, he has the abnormal ability to make his beak sink back into his face, which he achieves by pulling back on his head crest. When he releases his grasp, his head and beak are catapulted forward with enough destructive power to bust through large amounts of bedrock; Zoro describes this move as being impossible to block and like a \"laser\". Additionally, both his Human-Beast and Beast Forms, King can wield his pteranodon wing-arms like blades. His wings have proven able to equal Meito being wielded by a master swordsman in a clash, and King can use them to unleash powerful projected slashes; these slashing winds can be launched in rapid succession and cleanly slice apart buildings. King is a very skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. He could use Hardening on his own sword to be able to clash evenly against Zoro's three Haki-infused, high-grade Meito. King possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. King carries a large katana on his right hip, befitting his size. It sports a plain-round, golden tsuba, a matching gold kashira and kojiri, and tsuka-ito of dark-orange color forming traditional rhombus gaps to expose the lighter-orange hilt underlay. It is sheathed in a saya of the same orange as the ito, which has two red cords with hanging, tufted ends below its mouth, plus additional red bands around the lower parts of the saya. King's katana has a swordbreaker design: its blade, along the edge, can become segmentally notched to form comb-like teeth, allowing King to catch and pull away swords that clash against it, thereby disarming enemies to leave them vulnerable to follow-up attacks. King can also combine his pyrokinetic powers with use of the sword, channeling fire into it in order to produce massive, flame-composed dragons from the blade's tip. The sword's blade was broken in two as a result of Zoro's final attack on King that ended their fight. Even King's suit seems to be designed to facilitate hand-to-hand combat, such as having spikes that extend out of his gloves and boots when he punches or kicks someone."},

{"name": "Kin'emon", "episode": "Episode 656", "chapter": "Chapter 580", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 664.", "appearance": "Kin'emon's appearance matches the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a black topknot and goatee. At 295cm (9'8\"), he is taller than Brook who stands at 277cm (9'1\"). He is also quite muscular. His eyes are asymmetrical, with his right eye opening more than his left. His attire consists of a samurai gi that is black and white striped on the left side and orange on the right. Kept on the left side of his torso is a pair of katana with identical flame-patterned sheaths. For footwear, he wears simple geta sandals. He has the crest of the Kozuki Family tattooed on his back. Over 25 years ago, he had blonde hair and did not wear it in a top-knot. It was only after Kin'emon became a proper samurai that it started resembling his current hairstyle.", "personality": "During his youth, Kin'emon was a rather brash and rude thug who partook in thievery and assault in order to get rich quickly. He was irresponsible with money, frequently falling into financial debt due to endless gambling and stealing from his childhood friend, Tsurujo. At the time, he was seemingly fine with dying, ignoring Tsurujo's advice to leave his involvement with the yakuza and find a normal job otherwise he could get killed (he happily claimed no one would miss him). Still, he had a conscience, which acted once he witnessed the chaos and destruction caused by the Mountain God due to his actions, especially after learning that Tsurujo, who had backed him all this time and suffered from the troubles he caused, had fallen victim to the gigantic beast. He was going to confess for his crime until Kozuki Oden stopped him. Kin'emon already showed great courage and a desire to protect those dear to him in his early years, something that earned him recognition from Oden. After witnessing Oden taking the blame for the Mountain God Incident, Kin'emon became a devout follower of the shogun's son, claiming that he would die for him. After being encouraged by Yasuie to reform himself for Oden's sake, Kin'emon adopted a proper samurai etiquette and a very old fashioned manner of speech. Due to his reformed outlook, Kin'emon now expects women to walk three steps behind men and talk gracefully and quietly. He, on many occasions, referred to Nami as a shameless, violent and obscene woman due to her careless behavior and felt disgraced when he got hit on the head by her. Kin'emon seems to follow the code of bushido, claiming he would commit suicide if he could, for the shame of being dismembered without dying. Even after being completely dismembered by a \"mysterious ability\", Kin'emon still maintained his pride as a decapitated, talking head. Like Momonosuke, Kin'emon is very stubborn, constantly refusing the help of others and claiming he does not need it, while also denying conditions like hunger and pain out of warrior's pride. Only after nearly freezing to death did he finally forsake his pride and ask for help. Kin'emon is greatly honorable, bowing before Sanji for saving his torso (which was separated from him at the time) and thanking him for his help, stating that he was now indebted to him. As shown by his constant refusal to accept help from Sanji and own claims, he holds a strong dislike for all pirates. This is most likely due to his master Kozuki Oden's death at the hands of Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates. Similarly, Kin'emon once stated that he cannot stand the sight of dragons due to Kaidou himself being a dragon Zoan Devil Fruit user, considering them detestable creatures and violently harming one at Punk Hazard as a result. He also seems to be very quick to judge things, believing Zoro to be the one who robbed Ryuma's grave after seeing his sword Shusui, a national treasure from his country, sheathed at his waist. Kin'emon has a tendency to be quite perverted in spite of his sexist ideals. Though he seemed to be outraged at Nami's sense of fashion, he still greatly enjoyed ogling at her cleavage and has used his own Fuku Fuku no Mi to manifest revealing outfits for her to wear. He showed his anger and jealousy at Momonosuke bathing with Robin and sleeping in the same bed with the women of the Straw Hat Pirates. Since Oden's and Kozuki Toki's deaths, Kin'emon now dutifully serves Kozuki Momonosuke, heir to the Kozuki Family, protecting him from any harm or threat. Kin'emon cares deeply for Momonosuke, traveling to the dangerous Punk Hazard island and challenging the Warlord of the Sea Trafalgar Law in order to find his young master. Even after being chopped to pieces, Kin'emon's torso and legs still attempted to search for Momonosuke and attacked anything that got in the way. When Kin'emon learned that Momonosuke could have been left behind during an escape sequence, he recklessly rushed through a mass of deadly gas just to rescue him, with little regard for his own safety as a demonstration of fierce loyalty. By his own admittance, Kin'emon is the type of person who does not give up easily when it comes to a certain matter. He was adamant in making Ashura Doji their ally once again, despite the bandit's initial refusal to join Kin'emon's cause. To this end, Kin'emon was not above framing him for stealing from the Beasts Pirates. However, after being confronted by Ashura, Kin'emon realized this error and that he was ignorant of the suffering his comrade had endured for the last 20 years. As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon knows how to take charge in times of war and rally his soldiers to victory. Still, he may think of himself as smarter than he truly is, which can lead to embarrassing situations as others praise his accidental leadership and strategic feats. Kin'emon seems to have no knowledge of Devil Fruits, which he considers a form of sorcery (including his own). The same applies for stranger, unusual abilities, classifying them as either ninjutsu or the work of a creature from folklore. He is also unaware of other modern things that are commonplace outside Wano, including dishes like pizza.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon has a certain degree of authority among the group. As such, he is an experienced leader who can take charge during a crisis and is capable of successfully rallying soldiers to war. The other Scabbards appear to respect Kin'emon as a leader, most notably Denjiro. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his dragon form. Before becoming a proper samurai, Kin'emon was nothing more than a thug who assaulted and stole from people, but his strength and reputation were already recognized by even Hyogoro, the most prominent yakuza of the Flower Capital. One of Kin'emon's more unique capabilities is his ability to speak through farting. This was convenient since it allowed Kin'emon a certain method of communication after getting cut up by Law at Punk Hazard, as his legs had been attached to a dragon's body while his head remained confined in a cell in the Third Research Institute. Kin'emon has an extreme amount of superhuman strength, to the point that cutting through thick steel is a trivial task for him. Towards the end of the Dressrosa Arc, Kin'emon helped slow down the contraction speed of Doflamingo's Torikago by pushing against it with his Haki-infused swords. At age 15, Kin'emon challenged the gigantic boar known as the Mountain God, survived its violent rampage, and injured it with his katana, making it bleed. He also possesses an immense endurance to pain and cold; his head alone was capable of withstanding Sanji's powerful kicks, while his torso could endure freezing temperatures that a normal person would typically die from, not to mention the biting of a vicious shark. During the raid on Onigashima, Kin'emon managed to survive a direct hit from one of Kaidou's Haoshoku Haki-infused attacks despite prior injuries, although he was left barely standing and unable to fight further. Kin'emon's body is capable of processing toxic substances that would have easily caused potentially severe illness to others. Caesar's Shinokuni also seemed to have little effect on him even after it petrified his body, as he did not receive any sort of medical treatment post-release despite coming in contact with the deadly gas. Even though the rivers, wild animals, and fish of Wano became extremely toxic as a result of the pollution from Kaidou's factories, Kin'emon regularly consumed these tainted foods with no more major side effects aside from persistent diarrhea. Noted by Orochi for his tactical intellect, Kin'emon is an extremely clever tactician, having been the one to formulate most of the strategies behind the alliance's revolution against the Emperor Kaidou. At Dressrosa, Kin'emon was the one who up with the idea of disguising Zoro, Luffy, and himself as toys with animal costumes to get away from the Marines without drawing attention. Kin'emon was also smart enough to disguise himself as Donquixote Doflamingo while searching through the Dressrosa Royal Palace, allowing him to trick Gladius without the latter suspecting him of being an intruder. At Onigashima, Kin'emon would employ similar tactics, camouflaging the members of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance in uniforms of the Beasts Pirates, allowing them to better infiltrate Kaidou's domain and assimilate among his forces while remaining undetected until the time of the confrontation. Kin'emon also made sure that every ship used by the samurai sank upon landing on Onigashima, with the intent of erasing evidence of their presence from the Orochi Oniwabanshu. Kin'emon's strategies, however, are not always flawless, sometimes requiring an extraordinary amount of luck for them to come into fruition. In order to recruit Shutenmaru, his former comrade and leader of the Mt. Atama Thieves, Kin'emon successfully framed his group for stealing supplies from the Beasts Pirates in order to provoke conflict between them, so Ashura would find himself forced to join the rebellion out of survival, but that ended up backfiring when Ashura discovered Kin'emon's scheme. The bandit eventually rejoined the Scabbards anyway, but mostly because of Yasuie's convenient sacrifice. Something similar happened later at the start of the Onigashima raid, where Kin'emon managed to accidentally mislead the alliance's traitor because he turned out to be the only samurai in all of Wano to not realize the real meaning of Yasuie's secret message, having overthought its contents and expecting everybody else to have followed the same logical process he did. Though not on the same level as Luffy and Zoro, Kin'emon has exceptional luck, which has worked in his favor whenever he seemed to have had the worst luck. Despite losing Raizo, Momonosuke, then Kanjuro, he managed to find his way onto Punk Hazard, where during a series of events, he ended up encountering the Straw Hat Pirates, after Law had severed him into pieces using his Ope Ope no Mi, resulting in him earning them and the Heart Pirates as allies for the Raid of Onigashima. At the peak of his luck, through Kin'emon's misreading of Shimotsuki Yasuie's final message to them and altering their plans, he managed to decieve Kanjurou, who turned out to be a spy and a member of the Kurozumi Family, causing him to reveal and outing himself. Later on, after being stabbed in the back by Kaidou, it resulted in his lower half coming undone again, same as what happened on Punk Hazard, because Law was not the one who put him back together, allowing him to survive and inform the others, who tended to him and Kiku. As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards of Kozuki Oden, Kin'emon is one of the most powerful samurai of Wano, noted by Orochi himself to be an incredibly strong master in swordsmanship. His skills are extremely versatile, able to wield either one or dual wield both his swords with incredible power and precision. Even after getting dismembered into several body parts by the Ope Ope no Mi, Kin'emon was capable of putting up a fight with his legs, recklessly attacking Luffy's party when they encountered him. His torso alone was able to match Brook in swordsmanship, utilizing a two-sword style despite the lack of a head or legs. Alongside Zoro and Brook, Kin'emon was able to cut down multiple G-5 Marines with great ease and is capable of cutting steel as well. Kin'emon specializes in a sword style he calls Foxfire Style (, Kitsunebi-ry?, literally \"Fox-Fire Style\"). He is somehow capable of generating, attacking with, and cutting fire with one of his swords. Using this, he had no problem cutting through Smiley's pieces (which were highly flammable) and subsequently slash through the resulting explosion. His fire-enhanced sword slashes are powerful enough to seriously injure a dragon, despite its scales being stronger than steel. Kin'emon's mastery of this sword style was great enough to split apart even Kaidou's Bolo Breath which has immense firepower. He is also able to generate flames to safely cauterize wounds. Moreover, Kin'emon is capable of emulating Oden's signature Oden Two Sword Style style, to perform one of his techniques albeit being significantly less powerful. During his youth, Kin'emon's skills were acknowledged by Hyogoro, who stated that his subordinates could never be able to stand toe-to-toe with him. He was shown being able to fight on par with Ashura Doji during a sparring session. Kin'emon ate the Fuku Fuku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform small objects placed on a person's head, such as pebbles and leaves, into various articles of clothing. The clothes disappear once they have been removed or once they have taken a certain amount of damage. He must first visualize the appearance of the clothes, otherwise his creations are limited. While this power lacks direct combat applications, it does have a number of support functions; he can provide quick disguises for himself and his allies, letting them move around enemy territory undetected. He can also provide the necessary attire for survival in harsh weather conditions, such as creating a winter coat that can be worn in a frigid climate. Finally, he can create armor that can be used in combat. Like many characters from Wano, Kin'emon considers his Devil Fruit ability a form of sorcery, but he is aware of his weakness to bodies of water. Kin'emon is a very skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, as even after getting split by Law, his legs and his torso were able to fight, dodge attacks, and even defeat people without being attached to his head. When Kin'emon's disembodied legs first \"spoke\", they said it could feel the \"aura\" of other people around it, accurately attacking them. Furthermore, his separated body parts navigated through Punk Hazard's geography by sensing their surroundings (although his legs still managed to somehow get stuck to a dragon). Kin'emon is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, known in Wano as \"Ryuo\". His Busoshoku Haki is strong enough to withstand the Torikago's razor sharp threads, which can slice cannon balls and meteorites with ease. When fueled by rage, his Haki-infused sword was able to pierce Kaidou's nigh-invulnerable body. Kin'emon wields two katana named Sukesan and Kakusan which he uses for his Foxfire Style and Oden Two Sword Style. He also has a small dagger with him, although it appears that he only carries it around to commit seppuku if a situation calls for it."},

{"name": "Killer", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Killer is a tall, muscular man. He has long wild blonde hair that reaches down to his thighs. He wears a plain, white and light-blue striped full-head helmet with many rows of holes in it, and what look like modern headphones on both sides. He also wears a black shirt with white polka-dots and an open collar that shows his chest, with blue riding chaps over his pants. Additionally, Killer has a red sash around his waist. He carries a pair of handguards which have very long detachable scythes connected to them. When not fighting, these scythes are placed in a large sheath tied to his right hip. In an SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Killer is shown as a kid with a wavy hair that covered his eyes with a plain t-shirt, pants and shoes, eating a plate of noodles. This makes a reference to SBS Volume 62, that Oda stated that Killer, as an adult, prefers to consume food that can pass through the holes of his mask, such as stick-shaped ones and ramen. After the timeskip, Killer is shown as more muscular and with a thicker neck. He has grown a goatee and is shown to have a prominent scar on his left arm. His hair is shorter, now only reaching down to his back. He has changed his attire after the two-year timeskip to a blue t-shirt with his customized Jolly Roger on. Under the guise as Kamazo the Manslayer, Killer lost his mask and has bandages covering most of his face and arms. He has sharp, slanted eyes with blue pupils. His hair is kept bound, and he wears a red violet kimono with yellow sickle-shaped patterns placed on it irregularly, as well as a dark violet obi around his waist and a cape that both have target patterns on them. By the time of the Fire Festival, Killer regained his mask, although it was heavily damaged during his fight with Hawkins, having received several cracks.", "personality": "Like the rest of Kid's crew, Killer comes across as both mildly arrogant and level-headed, in the latter case, probably more so than their captain. Of course, this does not mean he is not as enticed toward violence as anybody else on the crew. He also remains fairly silent during combat, save for the slicing of his blades, and tends to focus on the elimination of his enemies. Killer is more knowledgeable than his captain in terms of historical facts, as shown when he informed Kid the meaning of the Ox Bell. After the timeskip, Killer has been shown to be much calmer than his captain, advising him to be polite when meeting with his fellow Supernovas, and was then able to prevent a fight between him and Scratchmen Apoo from escalating while reminding them of the purpose of their meeting. He also seems to be more reasonable than his captain, which is in contrast to his name, as he tried to reason things out rather than immediately trying to start a fight. Killer is very caring towards his allies. Though the exact terms are unknown, he was made an offer where he could save his crew by eating a SMILE fruit and working for Orochi, and Killer accepted the deal. After eating a faulty SMILE fruit, Killer lost the ability to express negative emotions and is now only able to smile and laugh. After taking on the alias Kamazo, he displays the traits of a violent man who takes pleasure in killing. If he encounters someone whom he has not been ordered to kill, he will give them the chance to get out of his way but will kill anyone who stands between him and his target without issue. He is very confident in his abilities, constantly taunting his opponents and being sure that they will lose to him. As someone who worked for Orochi, \"Kamazo\" held the shogun in high regard and would get mad if anyone referred to the shogun in an impolite manner. By the time of the raid on Onigashima, Killer started regaining much of his former personality, though he still suffers from the effect of the faulty SMILE fruit. A week after the raid, Killer expresses admiration at General Franky, continuing a running gag that male characters often partake in when they see robots. Like many other people, he has a unique laughter style: \"Faffaffaffa\" (?). According to Kid, Killer hates his own laugh to the point of stopping himself from doing so ever since. Moreover, he also hates people laughing at his laugh and is willing to kill them for it. His favorite food is spaghetti, his mask being specially designed so he can eat it without removing the mask.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Worst Generation, he is a powerful pirate, being the only one (alongside Roronoa Zoro), not to be a captain; where along with him he is also one of the two members who does not have the powers of a Devil Fruit, unlike everyone else. Prior to the timeskip, he obtained a bounty of a 162,000,000 by the time he had reached the Sabaody Archipelago, where he briefly faced off against Urouge, another member of the Worst Generation, with apparent ease. After the time skip, his abilities have increased, where his bounty increased to 200,000,000. He was able to face Zoro, where the latter recognized Killer's power. At the same time, he managed to wound him, albeit with a surprise attack, only to be defeated in the end. Killer himself believed that he could have killed Zoro if he had used his Punishers. During the raid on Onigashima, he earned the distinction of injuring Kaidou, formerly of the Four Emperors and considered the \"The Strongest Creature\", where Kaidou himself recognized his power. He later defeated to Basil Hawkins, another Worst Generation member, where the latter seemed to recognize he could not defeat Killer, so he decided to use dirty tricks. Additionally, Killer has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. After eating a failed SMILE, Killer lost his ability to swim and to show other expressions besides a smile. Killer's style of fighting seems to rely mainly on his extraordinary speed and agility, which he uses to overpower his opponents before they can strike him or dodge his attacks. Killer's fighting style tends to be highly acrobatic as a result and he is able to slice targets before being noticed or detected. During his battle with Zoro, he managed to put him in constant trouble in terms of speed, and he was even able to steal Napoleon from Emperor Big Mom's clutches before she could realize it. Killer possesses immense physical strength, being capable of fighting head on with Urouge, a man twice his size. He has incredible levels of physical endurance and stamina, being able to continue fighting after a lightning strike from Zeus, one of Big Mom's most powerful homies. Killer possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Killer is seen wielding a pair of gauntlets equipped with scythe-like blades, which he dubs \"Punishers\". The blades are capable of spinning around like buzzsaws or simply being used as hand scythes. These weapons can also be used to block other weapons, leaving the foe open for Killer to kick the enemy's flank or other exposed areas. This, combined with the agility he has so far displayed in combat and the notion that he is not afraid to kill, makes him a formidable foe. If spun at a high enough speed, the Punishers can generate powerful soundwaves to inflict damage to its target from the inside. This way, Killer even managed to hurt Kaidou, in his full dragon form, a feat only a few people were capable of, let alone dared to. As Kamazo, Killer used two regular scythes, but lost them after he was defeated by Zoro. In the anime, Killer was shown able to launch flying slash attacks with both sets of weapons."},
{"name": "Kikunojo", "episode": "Episode 913", "chapter": "Chapter 899", "year": 2018, "note": "", "appearance": "Kikunojo has a feminine appearance and is noted for her beauty, given her past reputation as the \"most beautiful swordsman in Wano Country\" (, Wano Kuni ichi no biseinen kenshi?). She has indigo eyes as well as long, dark-violet (dark-blue in the anime) hair that falls onto her back, and is very tall, easily towering over the likes of Luffy and Zoro, as well as her brother, at 287 cm. In the present, Kikunojo has taken to wearing sandals and a yellow kimono with chrysanthemum floral patterns and a pink-and-cream-and-lavender obi, white tabi, and black-soled zri. When she prepares for combat, she ties her hair into a ponytail with a red ribbon and rolls up her kimono sleeves with a tasuki, and sometimes dons a white Noh hannya mask. For the raid on Onigashima and the battle against the Beasts Pirates, she wore a full set of Japanese armor. Before being transported to the future, Kiku dressed in more masculine clothing typical of a samurai. After arriving in the future, Kiku began showing a significantly more feminine side, such as wearing red lipstick and dressing more in feminine clothing. During the Scabbards' fight against Kaidou, most of Kikunojo's left arm was sliced off by one of his attacks.", "personality": "Despite her reputation as a legendary male samurai as one of the Scabbards, Kikunojo describes herself as being \"a woman at heart\", and thus lives and presents herself in a traditionally feminine manner. She is a very upbeat and friendly person. To friends, she is helpful and nurturing, as seen when she treated Zoro's injuries and tended to Tama when she was being healed of her poisoning. Kikunojo is shown to be a confident, hardened warrior whose friendly nature translates into a strong sense of justice and desire to protect those around her. This was first demonstrated when she served as an ally to Luffy in his mission to rescue Tama from the Beasts Pirates. Kiku even went as far as to cut off Urashima's top-knot (a sign of great disrespect to someone of the samurai class) after hearing him use dehumanizing language toward a crowd of Bakura Town residents, regardless of the fact that just moments prior the same people had berated her due to low social standing. When Kin'emon contemplated the possibility of one of the Nine Red Scabbards being a spy, Kikunojo rebuked him for being indecisive about the matter and told him that they should identify the spy immediately. Kikunojo's desire to do right can sometimes result in her making rash actions, as she acknowledged when she inadvertently showed her samurai abilities in front of the Bakura Town citizens while living in hiding. Afterwards, she showed more restraint about going to fight enemies, and had to be convinced by Zoro to use her abilities to help save Tama. Kikunojo typically becomes extremely emotional when she loses something dear to her, as she quickly teared up and ran off to be alone after going to the ruins of Oden Castle for the first time since Oden and Toki's deaths. Additionally, she was very emotional when Kanjuro revealed himself to be working for Orochi, and when she reunited with Izou. However, she did not lose any resolve when being grievously wounded herself, not showing any distress after having her left arm severed beyond an initially shocked look and a brief grunt of pain while having her wound cauterized by fire. Kikunojo takes pride in her role as a retainer of the Kozuki clan, and occasionally refers to herself using sessha ( or ?), an archaic pronoun similar to \"I\" in the English language, which is used primarily by samurai (the Viz translation has her refer to herself as \"this one\"). When Momonosuke used the word \"Sunacchi\", Kikunojo quickly rebuked him for doing so as she believes members of a noble family like the Kozuki should not use coarse words associated with commoners.", "abilities_and_powers": "Kikunojo has some musical talent, likely due to being raised in a dancing school. As a young child, she already knew how to play the shamisen. True to her large size, Kiku has immense strength, able to apply enough strength in her swordsmanship to perform powerful flying slashes. She is extremely fast and agile, able to easily evade Urashima's attempt embrace as well as sprinting towards Kanjuro instantly while wearing a full set of armor. She has extraordinary endurance, able to withstand having her arm amputated, followed by the cauterization of the wound, while exhibiting only mild discomfort, and quickly rejoined the Scabbards in battling against Kaidou. As a samurai and a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kikunojo is an extremely skilled swordswoman whose strength was acknowledged by Orochi himself. Specializing in the Gentle Blade swordsmanship, Kikunojo was capable of swiftly cutting off Urashima's topknot and fought against several Gifters and samurai effortlessly. She compares her swordsmanship to snow that lingers in the spring, saying the wounds it inflicts will remain with its victims in the afterlife. In Pirate Warriors 4, some of Kikunojo's strikes have a freezing effect on the opponent, which fits her epithet. Kikunojo is a master of Busoshoku Haki, which is known as Ryuo in Wano. Her Busoshoku Haki infused sword is powerful enough to pierce through Kaidou's right hand. Kikunojo possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. She wielded a katana with an orange scabbard, a red hilt, and a gold clover-shaped guard. After Kaidou's wind scythe attack broke her sword, Kikunojo picked up another one from the battlefield."},

At the same time, Karoo is undyingly loyal to Vivi, and by extension both the Arabasta Kingdom and the Straw Hat Pirates. In times of need, he has always embraced this loyalty over any fears, unflinchingly risking his life on multiple occasions, up to and including using his own body as a shield. Karoo's loyalty to his friends has also made him very determined to help in any way he possibly can both in and out of battle. Examples of this include how he helped Luffy and Usopp to defeat the Baroque Works agents in Little Garden, how he arrived with the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops to help the straw hats out of the desert and save Vivi from Mr. 2 Bon Kurei in Arabasta. Despite this, Karoo, like Vivi genuinely cared for the Straw Hats and became very attached to them, as he tearfully parted ways with them alongside Vivi, and has been seen happily keeping tabs on their exploits alongside her as well. When given the opportunity, he can also prove something of a glutton, and has been known to ignore Vivi's orders on conserving water even during long desert travels.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops, Karoo boasts the peak of his species' natural speed and stamina (famed as the highest among all of Arabasta's land creatures) being considered the fastest of the group, and well-trained in carrying and acclimating riders. With only a small supply of water, he can cross many kilometers of desert in less than a day; when pushed to his limits, he has been known to outmaneuver gunshots, and even scale sheer cliffsides with his talons. Karoo's body is also remarkably durable as a whole, as he took multiple beatings from Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine on Little Garden after the pair tried to use him as bait against the Straw Hats and Vivi and failed, and even survived Mr. 5's explosive attacks with surprisingly minimal injuries, to the point that he not only regained consciousness, but actively helped the Straw Hats fight the two of them, as well as Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek despite still being injured. He was also capable of surviving a stampede of fully-loaded warhorsescompounded by a bullet woundcompletely unarmored. His bill, is also quite strong, as he managed to used it to help dig Luffy free from being pinned underneath a mountain by a Giant. His wings, while incapable of genuine flight, are strong enough to keep himself (and a rider) aloft for several seconds if beaten quickly; their pinion feathers are dexterous enough to act as makeshift fingers, and manipulate tools as complex as scissors. Nevertheless, Karoo possesses very little capacity for actual combat, even when directly coordinating with Vivi. At times, he has been known to confuse maneuvers as simple as charging a stationary enemy."},

When one of the Beasts Pirates attempted to attack Luffy, Kawamatsu silently aided him by piercing his attacker with a fishbone. His compassion is best shown when he encountered an impoverished Onimaru and fed him with his limited amount of food, despite there being barely enough for himself. Due to his mother insisting that he impersonates a kappa to protect himself from the citizens of Wano Country, he takes the role quite seriously, never introducing himself as a fish-man but as a kappa. Kawamatsu also possesses a unique laugh: \"Kappappappa\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kawamatsu is a powerful samurai whom Kin'emon states (alongside Denjiro and Ashura Doji) is worth 100 men in battle. He is said to be the strongest sumo wrestler in Wano Country and holds the rank of yokozuna. During the Raid on Onigashima, he earned the distinction of drawing blood from the former Emperor Kaidou, said to be the world's \"Strongest Creature\", in his full dragon form. As a fish-man, Kawamatsu has ten times the strength of an average human, and even more so underwater. However, he seems to possess amazing physical strength even for fish-man standards. He can spit out fish bones with such extreme force and speed that they are capable of seriously injuring a person. Kawamatsu possesses immense endurance as he had been fed poisoned fish every day for thirteen years by the Beasts Pirates without dying or even suffering any illness like Tama, a feat which baffled his captors. However, Kawamatsu did profusely vomit once he was freed. He was shown providing for Hiyori while starving himself. Kawamatsu could withstand Onimaru violently biting his arm and the cold winter climate of Ringo as well as days of hunger. He appeared largely unharmed after being sent flying through a rock formation by Kaidou. Due to his heritage, he is a fast swimmer, which enabled him to sneak Hiyori out of Oden Castle. Kawamatsu can spit out fish bones with great speed and precision, potentially turning them into deadly weapons. He was able to spit one through one of the gaps in his cell and go straight to the neck of a guard. Kawamatsu is an extraordinarily skilled and powerful swordsman. Raizo states that his skill has not waned after thirteen years of imprisonment. He calls his style the Kappa-ryu (, Kappa-ry?), a Strong Blade form of swordsmanship incorporating his powerful fish-man strength and sumo skills to create rushing attacks that can overpower large numbers of opponents with sheer force.He effortlessly decapitated one of Kurozumi Orochi's gigantic serpent heads before the latter could react and swiftly defeated a group of Beasts Pirates. Kawamatsu is a master of Busoshoku Haki, which is known as \"Ryuo\" in Wano. He can use an advanced application of this type of Haki. In the anime, when Kawamatsu uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a yellow and red colored flowing aura. Yagura Ryuo (, Yagura Ry?, literally meaning \"Tower Flowing Sakura\"), is an advanced Busoshoku Haki attack in which kawamatsu repelled his opponents with his hands without direct contact, It was first used against several Beasts Pirates charging toward him.

Its species also appears to be capable of aquatic movement, as Kashigami was shown swimming through a canal to reach the Shandia sacrifice altar. Its species is capable of living for hundreds of years, and given that a four centuries-old Nola is around the same size as Kashigami was at its death, it is likely that Kashigami lived for centuries as well. Nola also demonstrated possession of powerful venom, meaning Kashigami likely had it as well. Despite being worshiped as a god by the Shandia, who seemingly believed it to be omnipotent, Kashigami was nothing more than a mortal, if long-lived, snake who instantly died after being decapitated by Mont Blanc Noland."},

He commonly uses this power to mold his soot into the shape of a flock of crows, as well as breaking up his elemental body into crows. His soot crows are able to fly at high speed and can relay information to his allies either by him speaking through them or delivering newspapers. The crows can also be used in combat, able to disarm enemies en masse by snatching away their weapons or by attacking his opponents directly.

He is also apparently very fast, as he has been known to swiftly dispatch intruders as soon as they appear on the island. Those that have heard of any legends about him often compare him to a demon. Like many others from his tribe he wields a spear, something he seems quite adept with as he used it to kill a giant snake.

{"name": "Kalifa", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Kalifa is a tall, slim, and curvaceous woman with blue eyes and glasses. Like Kuro, she often pushes up her glasses. Her strawberry-blonde hair was about shoulder-length when she first infiltrated Water 7, and she grew it out over the years she spent undercover there. She kept it tied up in a bun as a secretary, but let it fall freely when she was revealed to be an assassin. According to Vivre Card databok, her height is 185 cm (6'1\"), and her three measurements are B93-W61-H92 (36.61\"-24.02\"-36.22\"), making her breasts a G-cup in Japan. She has small studded earrings and usually wears outfits that reveals her legs and cleavage, much like Nami; something Paulie, who is offended by normal women's clothing, often chided her about while she was undercover. When she was Iceburg's secretary, she wore a yellow long-sleeved jacket, and high-heel boots, but as an assassin, she wore a long-sleeved short black dress over a fishnet shirt and stockings along with black gloves and high-heels. As a CP0 agent, Kalifa's outfit is similar to her CP9's attire as she wears a long-sleeved short white dress over a fishnet shirt, stockings with a garter belt and a white matching cape. When attacking Iceburg's mansion she wore a musketeer mask and a long red cape with red long sleeves, as well as gloves and a light purple cloth over a light orange dress. In the anime, her gloves are dark brown, her cloth over her dress is white and her dress is yellow. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kalifa is shown with dress and glasses. It was revealed that Kalifa was very bookish as a child.", "personality": "While undercover as Iceburg's secretary, Kalifa was shown to be a serious and business-like woman, and was seen to be dutifully loyal to Iceburg, accompanying him everywhere to remind him of his mayoral duties and attacking anyone who approached him without the proper respect. She is known for her trademark phrase \"That's sexual harassment\", which she often uses in entirely inappropriate situations, such as simply having her name mentioned. She is shown to be very bright by the ease with which she anticipates Iceberg's needs, and how well she meets his difficult schedule. She is calm, and tries to diffuse chaotic situations, such as trying to calm Paulie when he was shocked at Nami's revealing outfit. After her true identity had been exposed, Kalifa's personality became sly and crafty, as she enjoys embarrassing her superior, Spandam by accusing him of harassing her, again with her trademark phrase. Despite her initial impression of being completely serious and professional, she became easily flustered during her battle against Nami, such as when she correctly guesses the name of her Devil Fruit. She is rather absent-minded, and somewhat self-conscious about it, mistaking Monster Chopper for Nami and then denying that was ever the case the first place. Kalifa also got annoyed whenever Nami ignored her in favor of Chopper. She is also rather vain, considering herself so beautiful and sexy that she does not need to make her skin smooth with her Devil Fruit power.", "abilities_and_powers": "With a Doriki of 630, Kalifa has a high degree of superhuman strength. She employs a kick-based fighting style when not using Rokushiki or Awa Awa no Mi techniques. She possesses formidable leg strength. Alongside Kaku, she could produce a cutting shockwave powerful enough to cut stone walls while using Rankyaku. She could even match Sanji's kicking power, and her attack speed is fast enough to leave residual images after striking. During the attack on Galley-La Headquarters, her fighting style was strongly intertwined with the use of her spiked whip, but she was not seen using this weapon after she ate the Awa Awa no Mi. It can be assumed that after Enies Lobby Kalifa grew stronger, as not only she was reinstated, but promoted to CP0, which is considered to be the strongest intelligence organization. Like the other CP9 agents, Kalifa has mastered all six techniques of the Rokushiki style. Despite being the weakest agent of CP9's assassins, with a Doriki of 630, she is still considered one of CP9's strongest assets. In Water 7, she showed great skill at using a spiked whip. She could bind Franky, a powerful cyborg, and stop a Sea Train from moving away. Kalifa ate the Awa Awa no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows her to create and control soap bubbles. The bubbles that Kalifa creates are capable of cleaning anything, they can even \"clean\" the strength off of her opponents. Once an opponents strength has been \"cleaned\", they are almost completely unable to move. Their strength comes back once the bubbles are no longer on them though. The bubbles can also be used to lather an opponents body, making them smooth, slippery and glistening. When her enemy is in this state, their legs are too slippery for them to walk or stand, and their hands are to slippery to hold anything. Naturally, the weakness of this power is that the bubbles and their effects can be nullified if they are washed off with water. She can also condense the bubbles into a giant bar of \"soap armor\" to shield herself from attacks. This bar of soap is strong enough to withstand a bolt of lightning from Nami's Perfect Clima-Tact without taking any visible damage. However, she is unable to move while incased in the soap bar. Kalifa possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He has short, wavy, light-blond hair, what appears to be rectangular glasses over his eyes, and a short, dark beard on his chin. He also has a bracelet on his left wrist, and he is seen wielding a katana.", "personality": "Not much about his personality is known, but it appears that he supports slavery (or at least the World Nobles' right to own them more than normal civilians), ordering the Sun Pirates to turn over the slaves they freed, but could have just been following orders and protocol. In the anime, he also seems to be cowardly, as he starts begging when Fisher Tiger held him over the water.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a rear admiral, Kadar has command over lower ranking Marines. He was seen carrying a katana, and is presumably efficient in using it. However, given how effortlessly Tiger defeated him, it's likely he's not especially strong despite his rank."},

He appears to be older and chubbier than the other dwarves. He also has a lot of facial hair. He sports a dark coat, with a double breasted button up shirt, and scarf. After becoming part of Leo's pirate crew, Kabu wears a light-colored pirate hat with the crew's jolly roger on it.", "personality": "Kabu appears to be protective of his people as he was seen warning the others about Robin's magic abilities. He is also perceptive enough to know why Mansherry is acting selfishly towards Leo alone, and derides Leo for not knowing that their princess has romantic feelings towards him. However, like the other dwarves, Kabu is also gullible.", "abilities_and_powers": "It can be assumed that Kabu possesses the same abilities as the rest of his people such as great strength, agility, and the ability to cultivate any plant. Kabu ate the Mushi Mushi no Mi, Model: Kabutomushi, a Zoan-class Devil Fruit that allows him the ability to transform into a rhinoceros beetle. He carries two lances on his back."},

{"name": "Kakunoshin", "episode": "Episode 926", "chapter": "Chapter 918", "year": 2018, "note": "His name was revealed in Vivre Card."},
{"name": "Kaku", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Kaku is a young man, who has big black eyes with 3 eyelashes on top of his eye, and a long nose similar to Usopp's, only rectangular in shape. Due to this, several characters, such as Luffy, Sanji and Zoro have mistaken him for Usopp. When he worked for the Galley-La Company, he wore a white cap, a high-collared orange shirt with blue sleeves, jeans and white sneakers. When he was revealed to be working for CP9, he wore a black cap, a black suit jacket with an orange handkerchief in the breast-pocket over a high-collared black shirt, pants and shoes. When invading Iceburg's mansion, he wore an over-sized skull mask with a black fez, and blue robes. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kaku is shown with fluffy hair and a shorter nose (though still long by his age standards) and wore a cap backwards. After the timeskip, Kaku now wears a white variation of his black CP9 attire except for a larger hat instead of a black cap, and he also has a tie. His hair is also shown to have grown slightly longer. As a CP0 agent, he wears a tribal mask with a long beard as well as a protruding shape that fits around his nose.", "personality": "Despite his role as a villain, Kaku is surprisingly honest, even to his enemies and even more so than Fukurou, though he does not seem to take insults well. As soon as his hybrid (giraffe/human) form was mocked, he sliced the Tower of Justice in half, in a rage of embarrassment. He also talks like an old man, as remarked by several characters, despite being only 23 years old. He uses the term \"washi\" (meaning I, though used mainly by elders), rather than ore (also meaning I, a masculine term used by young adults). In the Funimation dub, he instead uses old fashion slang words, such as skedaddle and whippersnapper. After being revealed as one of the Water 7 CP9 agents, Kaku's personality becomes rather cold and dispassionate in contrast to his character on Water 7, where he was mainly seen laughing and smiling. Despite this, he often taunts his opponents during battle, and even ate a Devil Fruit for the fun of it, and exclaimed \"This is fun!\" during his life-and-death battle with Roronoa Zoro. He also seems to place a chance to fight over easy accomplishment of a mission; when Zoro and Sogeking were cuffed together, he wished to help them, so he would not be forced to share his target with Jabra. When neither agent had the key, both agreed that the prey was up for grabs. Kaku showed great sportsmanship after his defeat, where he laughed at Zoro's comment of working in a zoo. He also remarked \"too bad\" when Zoro passed Paulie's message of \"you're fired\" and handed over his key without Zoro having to say a word. He also appeared to be the only one of the four assassins undercover in Water 7 who expressed some regret that he could not go back to the way he had been living for the last five years. Kaku has apparently not changed in disposition after the timeskip as demonstrated by his cold justification for Saint Charlos' attempts to enslave Shirahoshi. He states it is necessary for the sake of global peace and the lower ranking royal families should be wise not to oppose the Celestial Dragons. Kaku has a childish side to himself as well, being openly excited by the futurist wonders on Egghead Island. He admits he always wanted to fight a space monster. When seeing Luffy at Egghead, Kaku is shown to be cautious and very obedient when he tried to tell Lucci to not fight Luffy without permission from the World Government, since Luffy is now one of the Four Emperors.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the second strongest member of CP9 and a current agent of CP0, considered the strongest intelligence organization, Kaku is a formidable and valued agent of the World Government. Kaku can also function as a lie detector. He demonstrated the ability to tell whether something is true or not by feeling a person's wrist and then tell the truth by determining the speed of the person's pulse. From his training as a Rokushiki master, Kaku has worked hard to develop his immense physical power since childhood and could match the formidable Roronoa Zoro in terms of strength. He has tremendous speed and agility, being able to move incredibly fast and leap from buildings from amazing heights and distances without a scratch, showing tremendous leg strength. His jumping abilities earned him the nickname \"Mountain Wind\" (, Yamakaze?) during his time in the Galley-La Company. He is a skilled and creative combatant, as despite having no previous experience with a Devil Fruit, he managed to hold off Roronoa Zoro largely by making up techniques on the spot, such as folding himself into a cube, using his nose as a battering ram, or using his neck as a Rankyaku medium. A highly intelligent and cunning individual, Kaku was able able to become a master shipwright within a 5-year period merely as a form of espionage and surveillance over his \"boss\" Iceburg. He is also skilled at developing or masquerading with personalities: ranging from fun-loving and almost childish to cold and ruthless (the former seems to be his true mentality, while the latter is a product of his assassin occupation). Since Kaku worked as a shipwright during his mission in Water 7, this means he has gained masterful carpentry skills to the point that he was seen as one of Galley La's best shipwrights. Since he was an evaluator, he has great knowledge about ships. He evaluated the Going Merry and explained to the Straw Hats the reasons why it cannot be repaired. Like Rob Lucci, a testament of his skills is that he was able to achieve them in five years while others spent their whole life growing their skills, and that this was an undercover job. He was also able to recognize the real Pluton blueprints even when Franky was flipping through the pages quickly. Kaku is extremely proficient in all six forms of Rokushiki, but his expertise seems to be in Rankyaku, due to his many variations of the technique. When used in conjunction with his Zoan-type Devil Fruit, his Rankyaku was capable of slicing apart a massive tower and deflecting blows that can cut through steel. His Tekkai, while transformed in his hybrid form was potent enough to withstand Zoro's Tatsu Maki, though he noted its strength; which he previously used to slice through several stone floors and overpower one of the fish-men, who are, on average, ten times stronger than ordinary human beings. With a Doriki of 2200, he is the second strongest assassin in his generation of CP9, which is said to be by far the strongest in the organization's history. He is also the most proficient swordsman of CP9, being able to use two giant chisels as makeshift swords when he clashed with Zoro in Iceburg's room. During his battle against Zoro in Enies Lobby, Kaku revealed that he is a user of Four Sword Style (, Yontry?, literally meaning \"Four Swords Style\") by using two Shirasaya and both legs (with Rankyaku), an unorthodox Gentle Blade Swordsmanship that emphasis lightning fast coordination and sheer speed to overwhelm his foes. He wielded both of his swords in reverse, similar to Strawberry and Doma. His overall sword skills are great enough to hold his own against Zoro, a powerful master of Three Sword Style, and even overwhelmed him on certain points during their fight. When he returned to Enies Lobby, Kaku ate the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit given by his boss, Spandam, which allows him to transform into a giraffe-human hybrid and a full giraffe at will, massively increasing his strength, weight, and durability, while also lending him the benefits of unusual features, such as the greater reach afforded by the long neck of a giraffe. As Kaku ate the fruit just after the Straw Hat Pirates had arrived at Enies Lobby, he did not have much control over it, as shown when displayed his Devil Fruit powers to Zoro, accidentally transforming into a full giraffe when he intended to change into his Human-Beast Form. Jabra even laughed at the fact that he turned into a giraffe. When in Beast or Human-Beast Form, he can make further use of Rankyaku, as he gains two additional legs. The power of his Rankyaku is also increased, as seen when he used Rankyaku: Amane Dachi to slice through the Tower of Justice, which he and Zoro were fighting in. His Human-Beast Form also has a square-shaped nose and limbs because of the shape of Kaku's nose while in human form. With this trait and his high speed, he created a more powerful version of Shigan, the Bigan, by withdrawing his long neck into his body and then firing it at his opponent, which was powerful enough to create a large shockwave, and, after being deflected, retain enough momentum to punch a square hole clean through a boulder. Kaku's new form was very unusual to him, as he was testing the new form out on Zoro. All his transformations, including the \"Square Form\", used the same move, and even Zoro remarked that the move Kaku was using was extremely repetitive. Kaku has also achieved Devil Fruit Awakening, letting him assume a new, much more powerful hybrid form, which greatly enhances his physical strength, speed, as well as his recovery rate. Unlike most Awakened Zoans, Kaku's personality was not overtaken by the animal nature of the Devil Fruit. In his awakened form, his already long giraffe neck becomes longer and serpentine-like. During his disguise as a shipwright, Kaku uses a variety of pavers/chisels as projectile weapons. After revealing himself as a CP9 Agent, he wields two Shirasaya as part of his Four Sword Style. Kaku possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. In his rematch against Zoro after the timeskip, while \"Awakened\", he hardened his nose and clashed with him. Kaku possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Even when standing in a hunched position, he is roughly twice Crocodile's height. He has a long face with black stripe-like patterns for a beard and hairstyle. His legs are relatively thin in comparison to his muscular arms. He appears battle-hardened and has a perpetual scowl on his face. The dark armor he wears and his hair style are very similar to that of an Aztec warrior, with red-bolted dark shoulder pads (the bolts were later changed to gray). On his chest he has a green cuirass, whose front and back portions are connected by metal straps that go over both his collarbones. The cuirass' color was later changed to a rusty red color. Around his waist there is a big, elaborated golden belt, worn over what looks like a green skirt similar to the ones worn by Aztecs, with golden decorations near the edge. He also wears what look like studded, black and gold large-buckled shoes or boots and matching black studded pants. During the battle at the summit, he lost his right arm when Aokiji froze him in a brief moment while Jozu's attention was turned away from him, causing the limb to become very brittle and break off once he fell over. Twenty two years ago, Jozu wore a black tanktop and a red sash instead of armor and had a much thinner neck, but otherwise looked the same as he is today. In the past, when Whitebeard declared Fish-Man Island his territory, Jozu is seen wearing a different tanktop design. When Jozu was a child, he was rather round and chubby. He had stubby little legs, and and sported large black overalls, with round buttons.

However, this loyalty can be taken advantage of, as Aokiji freezes him the moment he was distracted by Marco being injured by Kizaru. When he was young, he showed a playful side when he noticed Oden and Toki together.", "abilities_and_powers": "As 3rd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu held authority over all crew members ranked lower than commander. An experienced veteran, he has been part of the Whitebeard Pirates for at least three decades, from the times of Gold Roger. Combat-wise, Jozu was one of the most formidable, esteemed men of his crew, able to fight and hold his own against Warlords of the Sea and Marine admirals alike. The very division he led specialized in combat, acting as a vanguard to the rest of the crew. Jozu is also shown to be strong-willed, remaining unfazed by a powerful Haoshoku Haki blast released by the Emperor Shanks. Jozu has vastly superhuman brawn, with his arm, grip, and lifting strength demonstrated when he tore a massive chunk out of a thick, sea-covering ice sheetakin to an iceberg several hundred times his own size, dwarfing even giantspicked it up and hurled it back over his head a significant distance. Belied by his massive frame, Jozu's speed and agility are incredible as well, on par with his brute strength. While still a poverty-stricken, rotund child trying to make a living in the streets, Jozu's quickness and dexterity allowed him to survive through petty theft, evading all pursuers and never once getting caught. In the present day his speed, coupled with his strength and Haki, makes Jozu (especially when in diamond mode) particularly dangerous against Logia users used to simply let blows pass through them harmlessly and reform; when he tackled Crocodile, the former Warlord commented on both the great speed and force of the attack that had hit and left him little time to recover. A powerful hand-to-hand combatant, Jozu has a penchant for wrestling-style moves such as tackles and suplexes. Jozu further has great endurance, shown when he took, point-blank while not in diamond mode, a sandstorm released by Crocodile (though one more meant to get him and Doflamingo out of Crocodile's way rather than as an actual attack) and emerged unscathed despite being positioned at the eye of the storm. Later, Jozu was completely frozen solid by Aokiji, losing an arm in the process. Though he was incapacitated, he survived. Jozu ate the Kira Kira no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform any part of his body into diamond, earning him the nickname \"Diamond Jozu\". with this power, Jozu used to serve as the \"diamond shield\" of his crew, protecting them from the front. While transformed, both Jozu's physical attack power and defensive might are significantly bolstered by his diamond body's unparalleled toughness (diamond being among the world's hardest substances, alongside Seastone). A notable example of his diamond form's durability is that he was able to block the \"strongest slash in the world\" from the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, with no visible damage done to himself or even being pushed back much at all. Jozu proved himself a proficient Busoshoku Haki user when he successfully attacked and harmed Logia users in two separate instances. He launched a devastating surprise attack against Crocodile that knocked him a great distance back and later another against admiral Aokiji, which shattered his ice form and caused the admiral to bleed from the mouth. Jozu can use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Johnny tends to be the more serious and occasionally the more honorable of the pair, though he acts silly around Yosaku from time to time.

This includes rumors of \"Hawk-Eyes\" visiting the Baratie regularly when the actual story was about \"Drunk-Eyes\", to not knowing how to cure Yosaku (and not knowing what ailed him in the first place). Johnny occasionally says that he would lose or had lost by a close margin against an opponent far stronger than he is, such as Luffy or Arlong, indicating some arrogance. Johnny is also very brave seeing how he got ready to attack Mihawk when he fought Zoro. Johnny also stands up for what he believes in, this is seen when he fights Dick the Mountain Whale. He also has a cowardly side to him, as seen when he not only tied up Zoro to prevent him from assaulting Arlong Park, but through his willingness to simply abandon him to the fish-men to run off to safety with Usopp. However, when he is spurred, he is brave enough to go against Arlong and his crew and wise enough to know his action could lead to the villagers suffering. Johnny's bravery was still not enough to defeat the Arlong Pirates, leaving the Straw Hat Pirates with no other choice but to defeat Arlong and his crew on their own. One quirk he shares with Yosaku, perhaps out of pride, is always stating that any fight he loses, he lost only by a hair.", "abilities_and_powers": "Johnny is a swordsman like Yosaku, however they are relatively low in strength and power. When they tried to take on the Arlong Pirates by themselves they were easily overpowered. It is still unknown if Johnny or Yosaku have any special attacks.

Johnny had no chance against Luffy but he did do quite a bit of damage to the Going Merry which he ended up fixing. The fight was shortly stopped soon after Zoro realized it was Johnny. Johnny and Yosaku are inexperienced with traveling by sea as proven when Yosaku fell ill to scurvy. However, they are fairly knowledgeable about the world at large, such as information on the existence of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the Arlong Pirates; he even identified Momoo as a Grand Line monster upon first glance when the Sea Cow confronted the boat that he, Luffy and Sanji were on, hinting some degree of experience. They are, however, still incompetent and have been known to slip up, such as when they said Hawk-Eyes had been reported at the Baratie when it was actually \"Drunk-Eyes\". Johnny wields one of the two Nakiri Swords. It is a dadao sword with a red handle and a circular tsuba. The blade of the sword gets broader as it gets farther away from the hilt.

He has a stocky build similar to that of a sumo wrestler and a face that is commonly associated with various Japanese demons such as the oni. His yellow eyebrows and sideburns are distinctly shaped like those found on such demons, in addition to a bulb-like nose and an angular lower lip pointing upwards. He has a lightning-shaped scar that can be seen from his left sideburn and reaching over his left eye which he obtained sometime between Otohime's assassination and meeting Ace. He also possesses two tusk-like conical lower fangs associated with Oni as well; the rest of his teeth from the upper and lower rows are pretty much the same, albeit much smaller. He also has a severe underbite, which makes room for his huge fangs. He has long, two-toned black hair, with two long stripes, colored gold in the manga and white in the anime, coming from the roots over his forehead and trailing down the back, a topknot, and tuft of hair on his chin with a slight green hue. This topknot did not exist during his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, instead his shorter and flowing black hair trails off halfway to a light color concentrated at the back of his head. He kept his chin clean-shaven before joining the Sun Pirates, after which it gradually grew out over time. His hands and feet are also webbed, typical for a fish-man, and his limbs that are somewhat thin in comparison with his enormous girth. His gills (which are pale and pinkish in color) are in between his shoulders and neck. Under his pale red coat (which he swaps for a black one two years later), he appears to be wearing a Coral colored traditional Japanese clothing covered all over with black and white square-shaped patterns with the black and white layers alternating each other (beginning with the black outline from the edge) and ending with a dark square at the middle of each and every one of them. He also ties this attire up with a purple obi like a ribbon around his waist. Jinbe is often seen wearing different traditional kimono of varying patterns: he wore a karakusa and later a floral design during his time as a member of the Sun Pirates; he wore square designs during his debut and a plain one after the Summit War of Marineford. Four years ago, when fighting against Ace, he wore a black gi instead with fish designs on either side of the chest, and a red sash with a tanto tied to it. Two years after the war, while waiting for Luffy at the Sea Forest, his kimono has leaf-patterns. During Caribou's cover story, he is seen in another one patterned with flowers. For footwear, he appears to wear simple geta on his webbed feet. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the middle of his chest. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, his kimono is yellow and has a Jolly Roger design arranged like stripes. Additionally, he is also wearing an orange-colored coat. In the Wano Country Arc, his kimono is yellow with large orange and white diamonds patterned on it, a red sash, and his coat has a wave design, colored a dark purple that becomes progressively lighter and finally white at the ends of the sleeves and bottom. Like everyone else participating in the raid on Onigashima, Kin'emon briefly gave Jinbe a Beasts Pirates disguise. In Egghead Arc, Jinbe wears a hooded Hawaiian shirt, with a pair of shorts, an earpiece, and a pair of DOM Shoes. He wore a Neptune Army uniform while he was serving as a soldier and was often seen smoking a pipe back then. During Otohime's funeral, Jinbe wore a suit.

{"name": "Jesus Burgess", "episode": "Episode 222", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 234.", "appearance": "Jesus Burgess is an unusually large, tall, broad, broad-chested, broad shouldered, tan-skinned, muscular man, with a broad upper body and a thin lower body in comparison. He has curly violet hair reaching down to his shoulders and always wears a dark brown mask with orange decorations on it, which covers the upper part of his face but reveals his eyes and his nose. He appears to be based on Luchador wrestlers based on his name and the face mask of Mexican origin. He wears a sleeveless black shirt and a pair of white pants with ruffles coming from the base then reaching up to his knees; he also wears black bands tied around both elbows. Burgess also appears to be always wearing a championship belt, a belt which wrestlers only obtain from winning many matches or to show that they are extremely skilled in wrestling. It is unknown if Burgess obtained this belt from his mastery in wrestling or if it's just there for his wrestler appearance. After the timeskip, Burgess has grown a beard and become even more muscular. His hair has also turned a lighter shade than what it was two years ago. While at the Corrida Colosseum, Burgess dons the traditional gladiator attire of sandals and a loincloth, as well as his trademark belt. In addition, his right arm is armored, with his shoulder being covered by a plate pauldron, all held in place by a harness across his chest. He also wears a pair of black gloves. When he first entered the Colosseum as Mr. Store, he was wearing a light green paper bag mask which has eyeholes in it and the name \"Store\" which is colored aqua-blue and Happy written in black upside-down on the forehead. His regular outfit after the timeskip is mostly the same as two years ago. However, he now wears a vertically striped black and white sleeveless shirt that has the same orange symbol as his luchador mask, and he now wears a pair of brown gloves. In Dressrosa, he also carries a green bag which has swirly patterns on it. During the Egghead Arc, he now wears metal plating over the right side of his skull and jaw possibly due to the injuries he received fighting Sabo. He also wears his original outfit and reduced his beard to a chin curtain for the metal plating on his face.", "personality": "Burgess is brutish and ogre-like, and is also very loud and overbearing. He seems to be overconfident, as he climbed buildings and challenged random people in Jaya, proclaiming himself as the Champion. He also appears to have an intense love of combat, wanting to test his skills out on anyone he finds. He especially enjoys strong opponents, as shown when he found out that Monkey D. Luffy was fighting at the Corrida Colosseum. Despite, or perhaps because of his profound love for combat, Burgess also appears to be a sore loser, unable to accept defeat even when he is critically injured. He is also willing to use whatever dirty and underhanded tactics he can should he or his allies be unable to win in a fair fight, as evidenced by how he joined the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates in their nine-on-one assault against Whitebeard or tried to goad Sabo into approaching him by taunting him about Ace's last request and him not being there to save his brother so he could stab the revolutionary with a hidden knife. He has a much more serious nature than his captain, as he scolded Blackbeard for laughing when they lost the Straw Hat Pirates. However, he seems to have become quite laid-back after the time-skip shown when meeting Monkey D. Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum hallways and letting his captain talk to him. Late into the Dressrosa Arc, Burgess also displayed a ruthless opportunistic mindset, willing to take advantage of Luffy's weakened state to kill him and take his Devil Fruit, despite the fact that Luffy was the country's best chance at saving them from the oppressive Doflamingo. This is further shown when he tried to kill Sabo just to get his hands on the Mera Mera no Mi when he interfered in his attempts to kill Luffy, believing that it was his right to have the fruit. He is also very determined and stubborn as he ignored his injured state and infiltrated Sabo's ship and so he could find the Revolutionary Army's headquarters and managed to stay hidden for days before informing his comrades. After Blackbeard had become an Emperor and began going by the new title of \"Admiral Teach\", Burgess repeatedly forgets to address Blackbeard by this moniker and habitually calls him \"Captain Teach\", prompting Laffitte to remind him several times in the past not to do this. According to himself, he is attached to the crew's raft. Burgess' signature laugh is \"Wiiihahaha!\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As the helmsman of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of its founding members, Burgess is an extremely powerful pirate. After the time-skip, he has become the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, and is also, according to Gatz, one of the Ten Titanic Captains that personally guard the Emperor, Blackbeard. He defeated every challenger he fought in Mock Town with ease and, after the time-skip, won the A Block of the Corrida Colosseum battle royale within seconds, all without a single injury. His mere presence at the Corrida Colosseum was enough to terrify all the nearby gladiators, mighty warriors in their own right. Based off of his attempt on Luffy's life for the Gomu Gomu no Mi and his conversation with Sabo, he knows of a method of stealing Devil Fruit abilities from others. Burgess has tremendous physical strength. He easily ripped an entire building off its foundations and threw it at Ace across a great distance, while carrying it in the air. In the Corrida Colosseum, he completely overpowered all of his opponents in Block A (including a giant in the anime) by himself single-handedly within seconds. Burgess's strength also extends to his extremely sturdy legs as he jumped down from Dressrosa's immensely high royal palace to the country's street level without a scratch, allowing him to make it to Luffy's location in a very short amount of time, a feat that greatly shocked Koala. In terms of hand-to-hand combat, Burgess is also an immensely powerful and skilled wrestler. His wrestling attacks such as elbow strikes and lariats can generate massive, air pressure-based shockwaves that can demolish buildings with great ease. Burgess also possesses massive endurance and durability, as seen (pre time-skip) when he took a direct hit from a Gura Gura no Mi strike from former Emperor Edward Newgate, as well as Fleet Admiral Sengoku's shockwave in his Buddha form without suffering much damage. In Dressrosa, Burgess took Sabo's Kaen Ryuou at point blank range, which blasted him with enough firepower to smash him through several buildings, and recovered enough to quickly resume the battle. After being defeated by Sabo in a heavily injured state, Burgess survived being brutally burned by Sabo's Hiken after his failed attempt to steal the Mera Mera no Mi. Despite suffering this much damage, Burgess could stow himself away on a ship of the Revolutionary Army travelling to Baltigo for an extended period of time without any medical treatment, allowing him to contact Laffitte to inform him of his location in Baltigo while still on the verge of death, showing considerable stealth and infiltration skills as well. At some point after the Dressrosa Arc, Burgess ate the Riki Riki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants him superhuman strength. This enhances Burgess' already immense strength to the point where he can casually lift a mountain over his head and throw it a far distance. Burgess demonstrated the use of Busoshoku Haki when he hardened his elbow armor in an attempt to resist Sabo's Busoshoku Haki-infused attack in the Corrida Colosseum's final round. However, his Busoshoku Haki was inferior to Sabo's, as his elbow armor was shattered. Burgess possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. During the Summit War of Marineford, he was seen using two pistols against Whitebeard. When Burgess tried to kill Luffy, he wielded a large dagger."},

The hat she wears is a green Furaerka with a light-green lining. She has an anti-eyebrow below her right eye, bright red lipstick on her lips, and is sometimes seen wearing a brown furred jacket. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Bonney is shown with shoulder-length hair as opposed to her current back-length hair and a rounder face. Her clothes and face are somewhat dirty showing that since childhood she had a huge appetite. After the timeskip, Bonney is shown wearing a black hat (possibly a sunhat similar to Usopp's, judging by the rim) with a brown furred coat or cloak. She also uses pink lipstick as opposed to the red one before the timeskip. During the Levely Arc, she shows to have the same clothes she wore before the timeskip, but replacing her previous hat with one with earmuffs, in addition to wearing her coat. Her white tanktop also has frills among the rim. During the Egghead Arc, Bonney is shown wearing a dark colored leotard bodysuit with a hood, along with gloves, thigh-length leggings, an earpiece and a pair of DOM Shoes.", "personality": "Befitting her epithet, Bonney is an extremely gluttonous person with very poor table manners. She will, for instance, demand more food even though she has not finished her current meal. She is usually seen eating pizza, her favorite food, even when fighting or on the run. While Bonney may have an aggressive temper and acts rude, she displays considerable tactfulness. She knows when to fight and when to prevent trouble, particularly in dangerous territories such as the Sabaody Archipelago. When she saw Zoro attempting to attack a World Noble, she orchestrated a scene to fake Zoro's death, knowing full well that such an action would have led to terrible consequences. However, this sense of caution is overwritten when enticing food is involved, similar to Luffy and Chopper. Bonney also believes in the stereotypical view of what a pirate should be and that they all should follow an unspoken agreement of not creating a stir in delicate situations. The idea of a pirate helping wounded strangers also leaves her dumbfounded, implying she is not familiar with altruism among pirates. Several instances suggest that Bonney has an unforgiving disposition towards those who wrong her, holding grudges and cursing their name occasionally. She swore to crush the Straw Hat Pirates for the chaos they brought to Sabaody and appears to have a gripe with either the World Government, the Marines or the Blackbeard Pirates, blaming one of those parties for an unknown reason. Bonney may not be a pleasant individual, but she is capable of respecting others; particularly her fellow members of the Worst Generation, having shown a keen interest in Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law's exploits. While she was willing to leave her crew behind to escape the Marines alone, her relationship with her father, Bartholomew Kuma, was much closer, as she was heartbroken upon witnessing his brutal enslavement at Mary Geoise and even defended a Pacifista unit that resembled her father, proving she is not completely heartless. Bonney has a severe case of entomophobia, as she fainted from the sight of a whole horde of insects rushing at her. She is pretty vindictive about this aspect of her personality as well, becoming unreasonable and murderous against those who employ her fear against her, regardless of whether or not it was intentional of their part.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Bonney Pirates, Bonney has complete authority over the crew. As a member of the Worst Generation, she is a powerful pirate. Before the timeskip, she had a reward of 140,000,000, after the timeskip, her bounty rose to 320,000,000. Bonney appears to be a very skilled escape artist, as she has managed to escape from the World Government's possession twice. Likewise, she is skilled at infiltration, stealth, thievery, acting, and mind games thanks to her Devil Fruit. She proved this when she successfully managed to infiltrate Mary Geoise by posing as one of the Levely attendees, a noteworthy feat considering that for most pirates, entering through Mary Geoise without being invited or enslaved is considered practically impossible. Rob Lucci even noted she has escaped many times. Bonney has shown considerable physical abilities despite her slender frame. Similar to Hancock's and Sanji's fighting styles, Bonney's fighting style seems to personally emphasis on powerful and versatile kicks, as seen when she and her crew were overpowered and captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, she did manage to injure Marshall D. Teach, who is a monstrously durable man, by kicking him in the head. She was also able to make a distracted Luffy bleed and send him flying with just one kick despite his own substantial durability. Bonney is also extremely fast, as shown she managed to tackle Zoro before he was able to attack Saint Charlos and sense his killing intent quickly enough to respond before he could attack, and she was also able to stop Luffy before he attack a Pacifista. Bonney has an incredible metabolism where she can eat large amounts of food, to the point where she becomes fat and round, but instantly burns all the calories to replenish her stamina. Bonney has displayed immense level of physical endurance, as she was stuck inside of an Warm Eddy for long period of time and was fine, which caught Nami by surprise who thought it was an mermaid. Bonney ate a currently unnamed Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to freely manipulate the aging process of anything, including herself, other people, and objects. She can use this power to disguise herself, as well as cripple opponents by rapidly aging her intended targets into their senior years or regressing them into small, weak children. A unique effect of this ability is that the years Bonney steals from people are manifested in the form of sparkling jewelry and shapes. Any target whose bodily age has been altered by this power still retains all of their memories and cognitive abilities, as shown by the Marines and Bonney herself acting the same as normal, regardless of the age their body is showing them to be (though targets that have been reduced to toddlers have a tendency to cry as such). In addition, any markings the target may have will not be affected by this power, as Jinbe still retained his scar around his left eye after being turned into a child by this ability. Notably, Bonney also has the choice of employing possible alternate futures while aging herself or others forward in time. Like several other Devil Fruits, Bonney requires her hands to use her power, although she is capable of channeling its effects through weapons or any other object at her disposition. Blackbeard kept her in line simply by chaining her hands to a post, though it is also possible that the chains were lined with Seastone, preventing her from accessing her powers. The fruit's main weakness is that its aging effects, when applied to living things, are temporary, meaning victims will eventually revert to their rightful age at some point. Another setback of this fruit is that emotional outbursts by the user might result in unspecified altered ages for anybody in the proximity range of the user, including the user itself. This was seen when Bonney got confronted with a Pacifista resembling her father and it caused her to have an emotional breakdown, which then changed the age of everybody around her (except for non-biological beings) to an unspecific age, including herself. In the anime, she glows pink while using her powers. Bonney was in possession of a beam saber, which she picked up from a scrap heap on Egghead. Vegapunk noted it was a failure, as its light attracts a large swarm of bugs, which caused Bonney to faint in fear. After awakening, Bonney used a pipe as a makeshift club, swinging it as she chased Vegapunk down a corridor."},

His head is roughly twice as big as Sanji's. His legs are extremely long that their exact length is practically the height of the car he was in. His hair and beard are white while his mustache is black. Like other World Government agents, Jerry wears a suit, and he has a yellow pin of the World Government symbol on the right side of his chest. He personally wears red gloves that he uses for boxing.", "personality": "As a Cipher Pol agent, he is staunchly loyal to the World Government. While fighting Sanji, he was shown to be foolishly boastful of his fighting capabilities against him; which he belays his men from informing CP9 of his intrusion. Despite his pride in his Boxing skills, he is also devious and not above breaking its basic rules such as using kicks and feign attacks to gain an edge in battle.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jerry is a self-proclaimedboxing champion from Karate IslandinSouth Blue. While Jerry has excellent boxing skills, he has a great disadvantage if he is in a situation where his movements are greatly hindered, due to his height. To compensate in such a situation, Jerry learned Yoga so he could fight in small areas by positioning his legs behind his head. However while in his Yoga position, his normally long reach is hindered due to his legs getting in the way. Overall, from what has been shown, Jerry's strength is above that of normal soldiers, but far below Sanji's."},

He has a large z shaped scar running from his right temple, through the right eye and across the nose, a light stubble, and several missing teeth. As all Impel Down prisoners, he wears a black and white stripped shirt and pants, which are ragged and torn. He also has chained cuffs on his wrists.", "personality": "As most prisoners, he peruses his freedom and use any opportunity to ask for others to set him free. He is well informed on what's happening in the prison and knows about Portgas D. Ace's imprisonment. However, like most people, he is unaware of the prison's Level 6 and presumed Ace was locked up in the fifth level. Upon learning about Luffy' plan, he ridiculed him for his naivety, showing a realistic yet submissive attitude.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about Goen's abilities.

Water Law in Chapter 505.", "appearance": "Jean Bart is a large man with a fierce looking face comparable to a guard animal. His size surpasses that of Jinbe by roughly two to three times, being able to catch and carry him easily. He has flame-shaped tattoos on his forehead and a scar running above his right eye. He often bares his teeth. He has large sideburns that line the sides of his face as well as a long mane that runs down his back. When he was a slave, he wore rags and was often forced by his owners to walk on all fours like a lumbering beast. After his liberation and joining the Heart Pirates, he started walking normally again and switched to a black A-shirt. Like all those who were once slaves of the World Nobles, Bart has the \"Hoof of the Soaring Dragon\" mark burnt onto him, which would forever signify him as \"less than human\", though it's unknown where it is on his body. After the timeskip, he now wears a boiler suit with the crew's Jolly Roger imprinted on it, similar to the other members of the Heart Pirates, and has a full beard in addition to his sideburns.", "personality": "Most of his personality has not been revealed yet, but he seems to be a man of honor and repays his debts as he joined Law's crew, the Heart Pirates, after he was freed from the World Noble. He also seems to be patient and calm as seen at Amazon Lily, the opposite of his usual behavior at the Archipelago or the battlefield of Marineford.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jean Bart is an immensely strong man capable of breaking a bridge with a single punch. In fact, prior to his enslavement, he was a well known pirate captain. Even suffering abuse from the Rosward family did not deter him, thus demonstrating great resilience and willpower (whereas fellow captain slave Devil Dias fled in cowardice, only to get blown up later). He is also fast enough and has an extremely durable body due to being able to intercept and stop a bullet from Van Augur without a scratch. He was seen wielding a huge Flintlock pistol when defending Zou from Jack and his army."},
{"name": "Jean Ango", "episode": "Episode 706", "chapter": "Chapter 639", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Jean Ango is a tall, bulky man with small, piercing eyes and a large nose. He wears a green cactus-looking mouth guard, and sports a large sombrero with a red and yellow pattern on the rim and a green cactus on top. During the Colosseum match, he is shirtless, wearing armor on his right arm and a chain around his torso and shoulder. He also wore a large skirt and dark boots. After Chinjao headbutts Jean and knocks off his hat in the process, it is revealed that Jean's head and hair also resembles a cactus. His protector was also broken, and Jean is revealed to have a blocky jaw.", "personality": "Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Dededede\". Jean Ango seems to enjoy stealing things, as he was thankful to Chinjao for providing him so many opportunities to steal weapons. He is also perceptive, suspecting Lucy's real identity.Despite this, while sniping weapons at Lucy, Jean failed to realize he was hitting Chinjaowith the weapons, suggesting that he has keen focus. As a bounty hunter, he enjoys hunting criminals and aims to raise his reputation, apparently having captured many of the convicts who escaped Impel Down with Luffy and also plans to hunt down those who assisted Luffy during the Whitebeard War. He included Buggy in his list of targets despite the fact that Buggy was a Warlord, indicating that Ango disregarded his current status. He does not seem to be very familiar with Haki, as he did not know how Luffy was able to dodge his attacks. Despite this, he does possess a strong enough will to resist Chinjao's burst of Haoshoku Haki.", "abilities_and_powers": "Jean Ango has stated that he is a sniper, but rather than using firearms or other conventional projectile weapons, Jean throws the many weapons he steals, turning the arms of his defeated foes against his new ones. He demonstrates fittingly great strength and precision with his throwing, and despite his large size, is nimble and stealthy enough to rob items from opponents while he fights them. Little other strengths or skills have been shown, but Jean must be confident in his overall might as he entered as a contestant at the Corrida Colosseum. The fact that he can survive the New World with no problem is a testament of his skills, as well as being able to capture escapees of Impel Down. Additionally, Jean has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Haoshoku Haki from Chinjao. The only dedicated weapon Jean uses is a four-bladed metal claw on his right hand, but so far he has been shown to make much greater use of the weapons he steals."},

He also has a dark purple sash with light purple borders hanging from his right shoulder across his torso.

However, in spite of his ruthless nature, Jeet is also shown to have a strong sense of loyalty, being one of the few Colosseum participants that remained loyal to Usopp in spite of the massive bounty Doflamingo placed on his head, even joining in attacking those that did so. This is further highlighted by his willingness to not only fight alongside Luffy, but attack \"Doflamingo\" head on to protect his new ally, in spite of Doflamingo's own fearsome strength.", "abilities_and_powers": "The fact that he was responsible for the bombing of a government facility and that he also was mentioned as a noted participant at the Colosseum indicates that he has some degree of strength. Jeet and Abdullah seem to use a sort of tandem fighting style. While the bigger, presumably stronger, slower and more intimidating Abdullah faces foes directly while often screaming loudly to get their attention with his longer-ranged tridents, the much smaller, faster Jeet launches a quick surprise attack from the rear, catching their adversaries by surprise.

He possesses white dreadlocks which he wears a flat black hat over. He has a scar on the left side of his face, stretching diagonally over his eye. Like two of his fellow Elders, his outfit consists of a black suit over a dark purple tie and a white collared shirt, as well as black pants. He carries a walking cane. Notably for a World Noble, Saturn has eschewed wearing a resin bubble over his head while away from Mary Geoise, although this may only apply to when he is inside his quarters while sailing.", "personality": "Like the other Elders, Saturn cares about the balance in the world maintained by the Three Great Powers and wishes to maintain it. This also includes preserving the image of the World Government by keeping the events of the Void Century a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it. He knows about the significance of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and was willing to go to great lengths to prevent it from being awakened, even viewing angering one of the Four Emperors as a preferable outcome to avoid such a future happening deliberately sacrificing Guernica, one of his best agents, becoming questioned by another of the elders. When global chaos became unavoidable following the downfall of Kaidou and Big Mom, Saturn was shown to be anxious and sweating as he was left at a loss as to how to respond without the option of covering everything up. Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki although due to his high position he is highly diplomatic instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral. Unlike the other Elders, he seems to hold some form of empathy for important people he at least seemed to have met, as he was telling Kizaru it was an unfortunate turn of event that he had to go out and eliminate Vegapunk, though this would not stop him from executing his mission nonetheless. He also found it wasteful that they must destroy the Sea Beast Weapons, but preferred to maintain the Pacifista as a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice. Much like his fellow World Nobles, Saturn has a low opinion of human lives and the captive cipher pol agents by extension, comparing them to insects that will merely reproduce regardless of the casualties in the worst-case scenario.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Five Elders, Saturn is one of the few to have the \"highest authority of the World Government\", being the highest ranking of the World Nobles who as a group essentially have the right to do whatever they please. He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the Five Elders is Imu. Saturn's physical abilities are unknown, although the scar on his face indicates that he was in at least one confrontation at some point. The Elders were also confident that they could meet with Shanks, an extremely powerful pirate and one of the Four Emperors, without having anyone to guard him. Saturn has an ability that allows him to transform into a horned creature. In this form, Saturn could withstand a point-blank blast of fire from Sabo without difficulty. It is unknown if this power is related to a Zoan-type Devil Fruit. Saturn possesses a flintlock pistol which he took out when the Five Elders prepared to assassinate Nefertari Cobra."},

He wears a dark feather coat.", "personality": "Jarul deeply values militarism, as shown when he reminded the young giants on Elbaf that they were warriors above all else. While dedicated to militarism, Jarul is very open-minded as he readily accepted Carmel's claimed ideology in pacifism to engage in commerce instead of plundering. He strongly cherished camaraderie and beliefs, as he mourned the death of his lifelong comrade, Jorul, and noted that had he died a warrior's death, it would have been acceptable, hence could not forgive Charlotte Linlin for killing Jorul in a disgraceful manner.

He also has a wide chin and wears a red earring on his right ear. As with all other World Nobles, Jalmack wears a thick white suit adorned with medal-like knobs on the front. He also added a cape to go along with it. However, since he was not at Sabaody Archipelago, he cannot wear one of the resin bubbles as a helmet, due to the bubbles popping outside of that area. Instead, he wears a rectangular helmet, in order to prevent himself from breathing the same air as \"commoners\".", "personality": "As is typical for a World Noble, Jalmack is cruel and self-centered, looking down on those who are lower in social status than his kind. To this end, he would gladly shoot down anyone who dares defy him, including children such as Sabo. He was also seen with three slaves: one carrying him like a horse and two walking behind him in chains; this shows that he has no qualms concerning enslaving people. However, unlike the other World Nobles shown, he shared his reasoning for shooting down Sabo: the child had raised a pirate flag, which classifies him a pirate and a criminal, and deserves to be killed. This falls in line with the Justice doctrine many Marines have adopted. However, his more important reason for gunning down the small ship was due to it cutting his ship off, meaning justice was just an excuse to make him look more moral than he truly is.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, Jalmack has the authority to do as he pleases. If a person defies him, they shall be targeted by an Admiral, whom Jalmack has the right to summon to eliminate anyone whom he thinks has offended him. Jalmack was seen wielding a rifle-styled bazooka. Unlike Roswald, who wields a rifle with no skill or accuracy, Jalmack managed to shoot down a boat in the middle of the sea.

He has yellow-green skin, a rotund physique with disproportionately short legs and little neck area between his head and torso. He has a wild mane of reddish hair that almost reaches down to the ground. He has a very small round nose and a mouth with large and sharp teeth; his two upper canine teeth are much longer and notably curve to the sides, resembling tusks. He also has a pair of broad, light-colored horns on his head which curve upward like a bull's and point toward each other. The only piece of clothing he appears to wear is a short, raggedy yellow loincloth with a black pattern on it. On the right side of his exposed chest, he has a tattoo of Daiji , which means four. The color scheme first given to Jaki in the Vivre Card databook is completely different from his color scheme in the anime.

Unlike the majority of fish-men, his pale skin is identical to that of a human, making it easy to mistake him for one. While still being immensely muscular, Jack's limbs are disproportionately small when compared to his enormous torso (though their size is greatly increased in the anime, especially his arms). He wears a metallic jaw mask that seemingly disappears when he transforms into his mammoth form, and has a pair of horns on each side of his head. His blond hair is worn in a ponytail and a pair of long braids. He wears a light brown (darker in the anime) sleeveless feathery coat similar to Kaidou with spiked pauldrons on his shoulders, circled by a belt bearing his crew's Jolly Roger. During his fight against Inuarashi, this Jolly Roger was destroyed after being pierced by the latter's final attack. He has bloodshot orange eyes and a veined forehead. He has two piercings in his right ear, and wears spiked pauldrons on his shoulders. He carries a pair of tusks around his neck which are actually sheathes containing his scythe-like blades. His mouth contains puffed lips and pointed teeth like any fish-man but while in his mammoth form he has square teeth. When using Koro on the Minks, he wears a hazmat suit and wears a glass helmet around his head.", "personality": "Jack is violent and short-tempered, as one of his subordinates worried how Jack would react once he learned about Caesar's downfall. He threatened to destroy an entire city should he not get what he wanted, and made good on his word, saying that it was the citizens' own fault because they did not comply. His ruthlessness extends to even attacking children and the elderly. He has even admitted that he has a love for causing destruction, even when there is no real benefit to it. Those who have witnessed Jack's personality in person describe these traits as madness. He is also extremely sadistic, willing to torture enemies in order to get what he wants. He is barbaric and brutal to the point of hacking off limbs and creating terrible bloodshed, only ceasing his carnage when he has more urgent matters to attend to. When Jack attacked the giant elephant Zunesha, he was determined to get to its head and came up with several horrendously cruel things he and his underlings could do to kill it. He is extremely stubborn and unreasonable. When the minks tried to tell him that Raizo was not on Zou, Jack refused to listen to or believe them, and continued to refuse when Inuarashi offered to let him search the island without any resistance to see for himself. This, along with him disregarding his crew's comment that attacking Doflamingo's convoy was dangerous, proves that he refuses to listen to logic, to the point where he actually becomes enraged when someone tries to reason with him, having no patience for civil conversations. Jack's lack of reason makes him very headstrong and reckless, as he decided to attack a convoy of four Marine ships, which were carrying powerful Marines, to rescue Doflamingo. He is not above fighting dirty in order to achieve his goals, as he brought in Caesar's gas weapon, Koro, to annihilate Zou after the minks put up a formidable fight against his forces, simply because he was losing his patience and not because he was in any actual danger of losing. He is also strategic, and desires to use the most effective methods possible to win. Upon his return to Zou, he decided to outright kill Zunesha, the elephant carrying Zou, to destroy the country in the quickest way he could and avoid having to fight the minks again while ensuring they were finished off for good. Jack is very thorough in battle, wanting to make sure his opponents are completely annihilated and presuming that they will return to full strength otherwise. Additionally, he does not tolerate it when his subordinates fail their missions, having brutally punished Sheepshead for not finding Raizo. Despite his brutal and sadistic tendencies, Jack has no love for mindless violence, as he became greatly concerned when Kaidou went on a drunk rampage through Kuri and threatened the citizens that Jack valued as factory workers. He also acts respectfully to those who are not his enemies and have done nothing to annoy him. He can be subservient to those he acknowledges as stronger than him, such as his fellow All-Stars King and Queen, accepting insults from them and only replying with a quiet apology, or outright fearing his general Kaidou. Jack does not appear to care about titles or fame, as he got annoyed with his subordinates for boasting about his position and bounty. However, he is still prideful, as he got angry when he read the news report about his apparent death. Although Jack is normally calm and immovable, he is still capable of feeling real fear if he is vastly overpowered and left in a helpless situation. When Zunesha swung its trunk at him and his fleet in order to repel them, Jack began sweating in fear and watched the massive limb darken the sky above his fleet with his eyes bulging in panic. Jack even trembled in the face of his general Kaidou. Likewise, he was rather apprehensive when Queen brought Big Mom to Onigashima.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates, Jack has great authority over his crew just below his Governor-General. Jack also had authority over the region of Kuri in Wano Country, and its residents greatly feared him. In spite of his great strength, Jack is implied to be weaker than fellow All-Stars King and Queen, who both looked down upon him. Alongside King, Jack was confident in his ability to defeat any member of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of their pirate organization and mighty combatants in their own right, if challenged. Like the other All-Stars, he is dreaded as a calamity. His epithet is named for the fact that when he rampages on an island, it is left in a decaying state like it is suffering a drought. His bounty of 1,000,000,000 indicates that the World Government considers him extremely dangerous and threatening to their operations. He managed to sink two of the four Marine battleships that were part of Doflamingo's escort, and despite ultimately being defeated by the entire fleet carrying Vice Admiral Tsuru, Admiral Fujitora, and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku; Jack survived the battle while only sustaining minor injuries. During the war on Onigashima, Jack also bested several minks in sulong form before facing Inuarashi and Nekomamushi (the two strongest minks in Zou), transformed at the same time, though in the end he was completely defeated. He possesses tremendous strength and stamina, which is enhanced by his fish-man heritage. He has also fought with the Mink Tribe, including its two rulers Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, for five days and five nights without rest. Despite this, he had to use a chemical weapon to finally defeat them all. Jack was shown to possess tremendous durability, having survived being hit by Zunesha's trunk and only briefly losing consciousness despite the force being enough to demolish his entire fleet. During the war on Onigashima, Jack was heavily injured by the Mink Tribe's forces which had activated Sulong, but in the span of an hour he managed to recover enough to go and attack the wounded Nine Red Scabbards, believing he had a better chance of killing them than even a fully healthy Tobiroppo like Black Maria. Jack is highly proficient in dual wielding his Shotel blades, able to fight equally with Nekomamushi and Inuarashi, the two strongest minks in the Mokomo Dukedom, in one-on-one combat. He was also capable of fighting evenly against the renowned thief Shutenmaru, whom even Kaidou had taken an interest in, and managed to injure Shutenmaru before their fight was cut short. Notably, even though Shutenmaru had managed to cut off most of the blade on one of his shotels, Jack was still able to fight competently with the short remainder of its blade. In the anime, he was shown able to use flying slash attacks at a rapid continuous pace against Shutenmaru. Jack ate the Zou Zou no Mi, Model: Mammoth, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a full mammoth and a mammoth hybrid at will. Since he is a Devil Fruit user, he has lost the ability to swim, but because he is a fish-man, he can breathe underwater. Though, he still would not be able to move if he falls into the water. As a Zoan, this power grants him a significant boost to his physical abilities, granting him immense strength and size. In his full mammoth form, he was able to level part of a city by simply swinging his trunk, knock steel gates off their hinges, and leave footprints in rock. Jack also gains a tremendous boost in his durability and endurance; he was able to fend off attacks from numerous minks while they were in their Sulong forms, though he ultimately fell at the hands of the mink rulers, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, and he did sustain significant injuries in the process. Jack possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit. Jack wields two blades which he uses when in his fish-man form. He keeps them hidden and sheathed as the tusks around his neck. Though they resemble Shotels when seen from the side, they appear even more twisted, akin to his mammoth tusks, when viewed from the front. Jack had access to Koro, Caesar Clown's poison gas weapon, during his invasion of Zou. He used its power to overwhelm the minks and destroy Kurau City after losing his patience from five days of battling. He (and the platoon he brought along with) also had a hazmat suit to protect himself from the gas."},

He has long, orange hair and a big beard that seems to connect around his entire face, which somewhat resembled a lion's mane. During his time as a vice admiral, Saul wore a Marine coat like all other higher-ranking Marines. However, after his defection, he discarded it. When he crash-landed on Ohara, he was wearing a black shirt and gray jeans that were a little tattered. Also, as a Marine, he had worn the Marine cap, but upon his defection he exchanged it for a cowboy's hat. While leading a group of Elbaf giants in retrieving books from Ohara, Saul was noted to be wrapped in bandages.", "personality": "Saul was a big and friendly giant who was somewhat shy and timid. While he was loyal to the Marines, he questioned their orders at least twice, which shows that he followed moral Justice over the code of Absolute Justice. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to betraying them, as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a former colleague destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand. He saw the giants of Elbaf to be somewhat barbaric, and did not follow their traditions of fighting to the death. Despite this, Saul trusts them and would lead a group of Elbaf giants to salvage the books that the scholars of Ohara saved. Saul dedicated himself to protect Ohara's knowledge, and trusted Vegapunk enough to allow him to read the entire library. Saul was also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh (Dereshishishishi). He enjoyed seeing others laugh and have fun, as shown when he encouraged Robin to laugh. Like other \"D's\" before him, he was seen laughing before his apparent death.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former Navy Vice Admiral, Saul had command of the lower ranking subordinates, as well as leading a Buster Call along with four other Vice Admirals. However, his defection cost him these privileges. He had experienced the Grand Line and seen Devil Fruit users, so he was not surprised or scared by them at all. He even states that he was somewhat jealous of their incredible abilities. He also knew how to fish for nourishment and build rafts, showing basic survival skills Being a giant, he possessed almost unbeatable strength, which was, in fact, greater than that of most giants. He could easily lift a Buster Call ship up out of the water to slam it back down and destroy it (a Buster Call ship's size was several times the size of a giant at the time). His durability was immense as well, brushing off explosions from direct cannonball hits. He was also capable of surviving being completely frozen over by then Vice Admiral Kuzan. It was stated that all vice admirals possess Haki, so Saul could also use the ability."},
{"name": "Jango", "episode": "Episode 25", "chapter": "Chapter 9", "year": 1998, "note": "", "appearance": "Jango is a skinny, Sandy Blonde haired man who appears to favor of being strange, while wearing flamboyant clothes; as the most notable of these are his red, heart-shaped glasses, which disguise his heart-shaped eyes and matching eyebrows. According to Eiichiro Oda, the striped, beard-like growth on his chin is actually the stem of a mushroom that grew while he was sleeping (Jango having eaten the cap, but finding it so disgusting that he left the rest alone). As Kuro's first mate, he was known to favor a simple sleeveless t-shirt and blue bandanna. After being \"promoted\" to captain, he favored a blue, wide-brimmed hat, olive-green trousers (with similarly colored gloves), and black shoes with tall white socks. He combined these with a simple blue jacket when travelling incognito, but wore a larger, more imposing overcoat lined with ring-like decorations when acting in his \"official\" capacity as captain. Once he joined the Marines, Jango began wearing even gaudier articlesmost notably a bright purple-and-yellow giraffe-patterned t-shirtwith the standard Marine Seaman cap.", "personality": "Jango is a powerful yet somewhat bumbling hypnotist. He is mostly carefree and was fully aware of Kuro's tendency to lash out at even his own crew mates (leaving Jango to feel uneasy being around him). Jango was loyal to Kuro, even knowing his Captain could kill him at any moment and went along with any plans of his. Jango seems to love dancing, often implementing dance moves in his routine, such as moonwalking instead of walking regularly. While in disguise at Mirrorball Island, he recklessly entered a local dance contest, forgetting that he had to avoid attention from the Marines. As a dancer, he was shown to be competitive and passionate enough to win the contest in the end, earning Fullbody's respect in the process. As a Marine, he takes the role of Hina's admirer and Fullbody's friend. While they have become friends through a rather bizarre set of circumstances, Fullbody and Jango have become inseparable and are always together on appearances. Often Jango and Fullbody will copy each other or dance beside each other in sync. Like many characters, Jango has a unique Laughter Style: Uhyahahya.", "abilities_and_powers": "Having been a prominent member and acting captain of the Black Cat Pirates for several years, Jango is decently athletic and possesses some degree of combat ability and leadership skills. In melee combat, he has been seen using long, exaggerated kicks not unlike dance moves. Back when he was a pirate, he had a bounty of 9,000,000, a rather pitiful amount by Grand Line standards, but three times the average bounty in his home ocean, the East Blue. However, despite this relatively high bounty, Jango is not particularly formidable; notably, it took Usopp only one Gunpowder Star to defeat him. It is unknown what (if any) improvements he has made to his overall combat abilities since becoming a Marine, though by the time after the timeskip, he was able to rise through the ranks of the navy, going from a mere Seaman Recruit to the position of Lieutenant Commander after only two years. During the Summit War of Marineford, he proved weak-willed enough to succumb to Luffy's burst of Haoshoku Haki. After eating a mushroom that had grown on his chin, Jango developed the ability to influence and control others through his hypnosis, as long as he makes them watch the swinging of his pendulum, listen to the orders he gives them, and listen to the phrase he uses to make his hypnosis take effect: One, Two, Jango (, Wan, Ts, Jango?). When successful, he can hypnotize enemies to fall asleep, incapacitating them quickly and easily, as well as aid allies by commanding them to tap into subconscious reserves of strength, which actually does make them physically stronger in addition to boosting their morale. However, his hypnosis is largely useless against anyone aware of its dangers, as even Kaya was able to protect herself simply by closing her eyes. Conversely, Jango himself often forgets to close his eyes (or drop his hat-brim in front of his eyes) when issuing commands, resulting in frequent and embarrassing episodes of self-hypnosis. In any case, the full capacity of his hypnosis is unknown, as most of his successful commands were rudimentary, and performed on either the simpleminded (e.g. himself, Luffy) or willing subjects (e.g. his subordinates). His initial meeting with Fullbody, however, implied that he could manage something as complex as erasing all memory of an individual (i.e. himself) from another's mind. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, by the time of the war against Whitebeard in Marineford, Jango has started using a second pendulum which he claims doubles the strength of his hypnotic powers.[citation needed] Concludes non-canon section. The pendulum that Jango uses to perform his hypnosis is, in fact, a chakram (, Chakuramu?) on a string. It is made of sturdy metal, with an edge sharp enough to cut through tree trunks in one swing; Jango can wield it in one hand, spin it on his finger, or throw it as a projectile. He also makes sure to carry several spares in case something happens to the first. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. By the time of the Summit War of Marineford, Jango started using two chakrams at a time instead of only one. Concludes non-canon section."},

He has a round, pink nose, no chin and a broad mouth that makes up most of his face. He wears a purple shirt, yellow gloves, light-yellow trousers, black boots and a striped tuque covering his face down to his nose. It has holes for the eyes so he can see. He is seen carrying a bag with a Den Den Mushi that serves as a microphone.", "personality": "A quick, energetic speaker by nature, Itomimizu is highly enthusiastic about his work. At the same time, he is one of the more equitable Foxy Pirates; though he admires and supports the crew's trickery and viciousness, he is also remarkably honest in his commentaries (even exposing several of his captain's deceits as they were happening), and will freely praise impressive feats from opposing crews. He also appears to be somewhat sexist, repeatedly singling Nami out for her \"heartless\" personality."},
{"name": "Jabra", "episode": "Episode 375", "chapter": "Chapter 264", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Jabra is a dark-skinned man, with a Fu Manchu mustache, a pointed goatee, and long hair braided in a thick queue, that somewhat resembles a scorpion's tail. He also has a scar running diagonally down his left eye. When in his half-wolf state, Jabra has an unusually large tail and snout. He has the kanji for \"wolf\" (, kami?) tattooed on the front of his shoulder. During the events at Enies Lobby, he wore small, pointed sunglasses on his forehead, small hoop earrings, and a black tie over his bare chest. He wore a black tangzhuang, that was white down the middle and always open, but somehow always covered his tattoo when in human form. He also wore a red sash around his waist over black pants and shoes. He basically resembles a typical Chinese Kung Fu martial artist, commonly found in various pop culture and media. As an agent of CP0, Jabra wears the same tangzhuang, but now colored white to match the rest of the unit. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. When he was a child, Jabra already had his scar and resembled a martial arts student.", "personality": "Jabra is extremely competitive and was outraged that both Rob Lucci and Kaku have more Doriki than him, especially because Kaku had been weaker when they had last parted ways. His competitiveness and rivalry with the others often overshadows his rationality, and could be part of his wolf nature to establish himself as the alpha male or leader. As a wolf (or dog) he would find it especially aggravating that Lucci the leopard (or cat) would be stronger than him, given the natural rivalry between cats and dogs. Jabra is very short-tempered, and combined with his superstitions, such as his belief that Devil Fruits are inhabited by devils and feeble attempts at preventing Kaku from getting stronger by eating a Devil Fruit, he often comes across as a comedic character. It is therefore surprising that he's possibly the most rational member of CP9. Lucci, who's always calm and in control, is also sadistic and lusts for battle, whereas Jabra insists that he's a nice guy, and proposes a quick, painless death for his victims. However, in battle, a more predatory side of Jabra apparently takes over, and he howls, licks his lips, and mocks and laughs at his prey. Jabra also seems very interested in eating and tasting his opponents rather than just biting them in his wolf form. Jabra is also commonly known to deceive his opponents, as shown when he tried to lie to Sanji, telling him that Nico Robin was his sister who had been kidnapped by a pirate crew when they were young and given a bounty due to being mistaken for one of the crew, and that he wanted Sanji to rescue her. However, Sanji easily saw through this lie, and took his key while kicking him into the ceiling. He is also proud of his lying, shown when Sanji attempted to escape, Jabra angrily complained that he was the one who was supposed to trick people before moving in to intercept him. Many characters in One Piece have distinct laughs. Jabra follows in this tradition with a long gya at the beginning of his laugh (i.e. Gyaaaa ha ha ha ha!)", "abilities_and_powers": "As the third strongest member of CP9, Jabra was a powerful assassin formerly employed by the World Government. He was skilled enough to effortlessly defeat Usopp and temporarily overwhelm Sanji of the Straw Hat Pirates. He possessed moderate tactical and acting skills, convincing Usopp into believing he was a pacifist, and then using his vulnerability to deliver a critical blow to him. However, these tricks were quickly seen through by Sanji, who noted that his lies were unconvincing. It can be surmised that after two years Jabra grew stronger, as he would be reinstated and later promoted to the exclusive CPO. As the third strongest member of CP9, Jabra has immense physical power from his training as a Rokushiki master. Even without his Devil Fruit powers, he could perform extremely powerful punches, as he was able to send Usopp crashing into a wall across a far distance, despite having just woken up. Even after being severely beaten and burned by Sanji, he recovered in a relatively short span of time and was able to carry his fellow CP9 agent, Kaku, on his back. Jabra's fighting style is based around Tekkai Kenpo, a technique which allows him to move while using Tekkai, and throw powerful punches at his enemies while maintaining his defense. He claims to be the only Rokushiki user capable of doing so. His Tekkai was advanced enough to withstand Zoro's Sanjuroku Pound Ho and dozens of powerful kicks from Sanji. He can also use a range of other Rokushiki techniques, including Rankyaku, Geppo, and Shigan, and was skilled enough to combine the latter two to create Gekko Jusshigan, a piercing plunge attack. With a Doriki of 2180, Jabra's strength is in a different league compared to the CP9 agents below him, and his generation of agents is said to be by far the strongest in the organization's history. He is the third strongest CP9 member, behind Rob Lucci and Kaku, and he is only 20 points weaker than the latter. Jabra ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Wolf, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit which gives him the power to change into a full wolf and a human-wolf hybrid that resembles a werewolf. This greatly increases his physical strength, allowing him to uproot trees, clash with powerful martial artists, and, most notably, deal more damage with his Rokushiki techniques, which is further complimented by the sharp nails granted by his transformation. Jabra possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

As a samurai, Izou appeared to value a glorious and meaningful death in battle over his own life, stating that he missed the chance to have one too many times, and is therefore ready to lose his life in the raid against Kaidou's dominion over Wano. At the same time, Izou did not believe it was fine to simply accept death too readily as long as a person has something to fight for.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the former 16th division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Izou had authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. Also Jinbe, who was a former Warlord of the Sea, stated that each commander was a very powerful individual. The World Government has given him a bounty of 510,000,000, proving how dangerous he was. During the raid on Onigashima, the CP0 agents that encountered Izou preferred to avoid fighting him in favor of their current mission, despite Izou being heavily injured and it being two on one. While Izou was ultimately defeated and killed, he was able to take one of them down with him. As the heir of a dancing school, where he was raised prior to his father's arrest, Izou was capable of performing traditional dancing routines. Izou was an extremely adept sniper, being able to destroy a person's sword with a single shot. In the same way he was able to disarm an individual like King. He developed sharpshooting skills back when he was still a street-dwelling child, as part of his entertainment routine. He wielded a pair of flintlock pistols. During his time in Wano Country, he was seen wielding a sword in order to assist Oden to fight against Ashura Doji. He was also seen carrying a sheathed sword by the end of the Summit War of Marineford. However, despite being a samurai Izou admitted that he was not a very good swordsman and so he heavily preferred to use guns. Izou possessed an advanced level of Busoshoku Haki, which he could imbue into the bullets he shot. With it, he was able to penetrate Kaidou's tremendously tough skin by shooting it.

{"name": "Issho", "episode": "Episode 701", "chapter": "Chapter 630", "year": 2013, "note": "His alias was revealed by Sakazuki in Chapter 700.

He has an X-shaped scar centered on the left side of his forehead that stretches over both eyes, which was actually self-inflicted due to his decision to blind himself. He has short dark hair, a mustache, and a beard. He seems to be very tall, a trait shared with other admirals. Like other admirals, Fujitora sports the standard Marine coat with his personal clothes underneath, wearing the coat on his shoulders like a cape with his arms not in the sleeves. His sleeves' cuffs are purple. While previous admirals and other high-ranked Marines wear the conventional suit and tie underneath their Marine coats, Fujitora opts for a light-purple yukata held up with a dark purple belt, all underneath a purple cloak, matching the color in his alias. Fujitora wields a shikomizue (a Japanese swordstick) that doubles as a cane for his blindness, and also wears geta sandals. He has white bandages wrapped around both of his forearms, with handguards on both hands.", "personality": "Fujitora is a virtuous man who cares greatly about doing the right thing and detests evil. His blindness is a result of him intentionally inflicting damage on his eyes out of sorrow for all the evil he had seen, with him stating in Dressrosa that not having sight is a blessing. His Justice motto as a Marine is \"Humane Justice\" (, Jingi aru Seigi?). His primary goal is to protect people, telling a subordinate that it is more important to take into account the number of lives to protect rather than the number of enemies against them. He takes care to never put innocent civilians in harm's way during conflict and will try to avoid causing collateral damage with his attacks; when he does inflict such damage, he makes sure to compensate the owner of the involved property. Fujitora will make the effort to keep civilians away from harm even when he himself is not involved in the proceedings, including doing things such as protecting them from the collateral damage of other fights and even proactively calling for extra medics to come to the Corrida Colosseum in the likely event that spectators were harmed by the combatants' attacks. As a result of his desire to protect civilians, Fujitora is proactive about hunting down and capturing pirates and other criminals. He will not step outside his bounds to do so, as shown when he came to the Corrida Colosseum which was a safe zone for criminals, but he did plot with his subordinates to arrest the criminals competing there as soon as they exited the arena's confines. Fujitora is shown generous enough when he permitted Revolutionary Army and the Celestial Dragons' slaves to escape when Fujitora was never truly loyal towards the World Nobles. Fujitora's desire to eliminate evil also extends to rooting out corruption within the Marines and World Government. Crocodile's attempted takeover of Arabasta in particular drove him to question the government's choices and judgment, especially regarding the use of the Seven Warlords of the Sea as a check against pirates and criminals, when it often resulted in brutal and tyrannical pirates terrorizing people and shipping arms illegally under the blanket of government immunity. He strongly believed that ending the system would result in better outcomes for eliminating piracy and evil, despite its perceived threat to the balance of the Three Great Powers. He is willing to accept blame for the shortcomings of the Marines and World Government, to the point of prostrating himself before King Riku Doldo III along with his troops to apologize for the harm Doflamingo had wreaked upon Dressrosa and having it broadcast to neighboring islands. This resulted in a very tense and explosive conversation with his superior, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki over Den Den Mushi. As their conversation progressed, Sakazuki grew incensed that Fujitora's actions had caused the Marine's reputation, and justice by extension, to be shamed, since the admiral had publicly admitted that the government had failed in its duty. Fujitora then lost his composure and shouted angrily at Sakazuki, disgusted at the idea that justice was dependent on looking right rather than being right, one of the few times he has not been seen acting in a calm and dispassionate manner. As noted by himself, however, Fujitora is pragmatic and has had to align himself to some degree with parties he opposes for the sake of protecting innocent people. This dynamic drove many of his actions during his time in Dressrosa; at first, despite his opposition to the Seven Warlords system and suspicion over Doflamingo's activities, Fujitora agreed to aid the Warlord in opposing the Straw Hat Pirates for the sake of protecting Dressrosa's populace. However, he later changed his mind after Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his \"Birdcage\", as he believed that the Straw Hats stood the best chance of saving Dressrosa as well as showing the failure of the Seven Warlords system. In both instances, he made clear that he would pursue the downfall of both the Donquixote and Straw Hat Pirates after the necessity of working with them came to an end. Additionally, Fujitora will uphold the letter of the law for the World Government even if he does not care for it, such as letting Caesar Clown go free due to being the subordinate of a Warlord. While he will obey his superiors' command in most instances, Fujitora has been known to exploit loopholes as he sees fit, such as when he went to Mary Geoise while being banned from going to Marine bases and invoking the loophole when notified of Sakazuki's disapproval. Just as he does not hesitate to pinpoint and work against evil deeds in the Marines and World Government, Fujitora also has no issue with acknowledging good deeds done by pirates. He has rather bluntly stated that the World Government was to blame for Doflamingo's atrocities whereas Luffy, a pirate, was the hero of Dressrosa. When the Dressrosa citizens got in the way of his pursuit of the Straw Hats, Fujitora recognized the honesty and good intentions of Luffy towards the civilians. In fact, it was Luffy's attitude and actions that first caused Fujitora to regret blinding himself, as he wondered what Luffy might look like; he even thanked the pirate for saving Dressrosa. A few days earlier, when Luffy had exposed the Donquixote Pirates' cheating at roulette against Fujitora, the admiral was greatly appreciative of his kind deed and declined to exchange introductions so that he might remain ignorant of who helped him should their positions result in conflict. Additionally, as shown during the war on Dressrosa, Fujitora may choose to not relentlessly pursue people who are considered enemies of the Marines if they do not pose a threat to innocent people, especially if doing so would threaten innocents around them, or if there are more pressing matters at hand. Despite his desire to prevent collateral damage, Fujitora has been shown to use tremendous displays of force against opponents, particularly at the very beginning of his battles. While confronting Trafalgar Law alongside Doflamingo, Fujitora immediately started the fight by summoning a large meteor to strike their location, saying it was only a \"little test\". When Doflamingo's thugs tried attacking him and Luffy after their swindling was exposed, Fujitora immediately chose to send them to \"hell\" and slam them deep into the ground with his gravity. However, Fujitora's displays of force can at times be completely reckless, as best shown when he summoned another meteor during his fight with Sabo only to have it sliced apart by Doflamingo's \"Birdcage\" and destroy more of the surrounding area than he intended. Additionally, his attempt to summon a meteor against the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny whilst also piloting a battleship through the air led to the meteor being redirected and striking his ship. However, even when he encounters a bad situation, Fujitora has been shown keeping his calm, at worst only getting flustered. In the aforementioned battleship attack, Fujitora was shown sitting calmly and eating noodles even when the crew's counterattack put the rest of his subordinates in a panic, and he remained calm throughout Doflamingo's Birdcage game despite the mass hysteria inflicted, even putting his trust in others to resolve the great problem without hesitation. Fujitora loves to gamble and play casino games, having been shown playing roulette in his first appearance and making big wagers including going all-in in the last round he played. In fact, his obsession with gambling is at such a point that he has been shown to treat life the same way as a game of chance, having made allusions to betting and rolling dice when speaking of the conflict in Dressrosa and showing a great reverence for the forces of fate. Most notably, he treated his trust in the Straw Hat Pirates to take down Doflamingo as simply another one of his bets, though with the stakes now being life or death rather than monetary. Later, when faced with the choice of whether or not to follow his orders to go after the Straw Hats and Law, a choice with merits on each side, Fujitora decided to make this decision by rolling a die and assigning an outcome based on where it landed. When the die's outcome had him leave Luffy alone for two consecutive days despite the low odds, Fujitora stated that something was certainly on the pirate's side. Fujitora generally acts humble in conversation, as shown when he downplayed Doflamingo's words of praise for his abilities when the two of them first met. Additionally, despite his great status, his casual mannerisms are no different than a normal older blind man, and many of the people who saw him at Dressrosa did not know who he was. However, during combat he is shown to take pride in his status as a Marine Admiral and his reputation as a \"monster\", hating it when people take pity on him due to his blindness. When Luffy informed him of the attacks he would perform ahead of time during their battle and explained that it was out of respect for the admiral's character, Fujitora briefly lost composure and started laughing, though also expressed disappointment at the pirate's illogical behavior. Fujitora is also prideful when it comes to upholding his morals, as he refused to apologize to Sakazuki for his actions following the Dressrosa conflict even though Sengoku said such an apology would likely be enough to get his punishment lifted. Although aware of the great evil in the world, Fujitora has shown himself to be quite trusting and thus will typically accept anyone's answer to events he is unsure of due to his blindness. This was best shown when he was willing to believe Doflamingo's thugs when they told him where the roulette ball landed, allowing them to nearly swindle him out of all his money. However, if tipped off that he is being tricked, he will not respond kindly to those who trick him. Fujitora's willingness to give people the benefit of the doubt even extends to his interactions with pirates, as he gave Law the opportunity to inform him that the Straw Hats were his subordinates, despite those around him clearly knowing that that was not the case. Additionally, although he brought up the suspicions, he had regarding Doflamingo committing illegal activities in secret, Fujitora had no intention of pressing the Warlord over it before investigating further.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Fujitora has command over the thousands of Marines ranked beneath him, his status being just below the fleet admiral's. Among other things, he holds the authority to call out battleships however he sees fit and to initiate a Buster Call on any island he deems a threat, as well as pass on to lower-ranking government agents the same privilege. Combat-wise, Fujitora (along with his fellow admirals) is thought to constitute the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\", making him one of the world's most powerful people. As noted by Doflamingo and himself, Fujitora and Ryokugyu are known as \"powerful monsters\" in the Marines. Fleet admiral Sakazuki had confidence in Fujitora's ability to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law, both members of the Worst Generation and the latter (at the time) a Warlord of the Sea. From just a brief display of his powers, Fujitora earned the prompt admiration of Luffy, who could easily ascertain his strength. Yet another such display sufficed to intimidate Law and even the normally unshakable Doflamingo. Greatly attesting to his power, Fujitora was able to fight Sabothe Revolutionary Army's chief of staff and \"No. 2\" in strength, who had not long beforehand acquired a powerful Logia abilityto more or less a standstill, emerging from such fight without a scratch. By Sabo's own reckoning, Fujitora had not gone all out but merely stalled for time, due to not seeing his then-foe as a true enemy. Additionally, with the presumed assistance of other powerful Marines (particularly Sengoku and Tsuru), Fujitora was able to soundly defeat Jack, a top commander of one of the Four Emperors with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, in a naval battle. Despite being blind, due to his other acute senses and Kenbunshoku Haki, Fujitora can handle himself perfectly well in combat, even against very powerful enemies, with Law noting that his blindness seems to not hinder him much at all. He has excellent hearing, having heard Nami's lightning from kilometers away when neither Doflamingo nor Law next to him did. He also stated that he is able to sense the movement of clouds. Fujitora's physical strength and fortitude are immense, befitting an admiral. He was able to defend against and repel powerful attacks from the likes of Roronoa Zoro, Sabo, and Luffy as well as clash with them (including the latter when using Gear 2 and Gear 3) with little to no visible effort. He could also withstand a kick from Doflamingo without issue using his sword. Incredibly resilient, Fujitora could guard against a Haki-imbued Gear 3 punch from Luffy without using his own Haki while remaining unhurt by the blow. Fujitora has extraordinary reflexes and, coupled with his skill in Kenbunshoku Haki, can casually and precisely counter very swift and unexpected physical threats. For example, he perfectly timed his defense against an extremely fast-falling meteorite that he had summoned on his very location, deflecting a piece of it with casual ease, and calmly warded off an unexpected \"flying slash\" from Zoro. When Doflamingo surprise-attacked him with a kick, the admiral showed no concern whilst easily blocking it. The admiral's own movement speed is likewise impressive, as he could lunge forward to strike Luffy in their fight, being too quick for the pirate to react. Fujitora possesses tremendous swordsmanship skills, which he combines with his Devil Fruit ability, channeling his gravity powers through his sword. Usually, Fujitora wields his weapon in a reverse-grip style, the blade pointing in the direction opposite to his thumb. Despite his blindness, the admiral has shown to be extremely skilled with his blade, able to deflect or block incoming attacks, even extremely strong ones or surprise attacks, with little issue using simple parrying maneuvers, demonstrating lightning-fast dexterity all the while. Fujitora's swordsmanship, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, allowed him to repeatedly and evenly clash with Sabo wielding his flame-shrouded staff and exhibit no trouble in doing so. Fujitora ate the Zushi Zushi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to manipulate gravitational forces. The ability's range of effect can potentially span wide areas, even entire islands, and is primarily channeled through the admiral's sword. Fujitora can drastically increase the gravity around others, keeping them on the ground and making it difficult for them to move, including extremely strong adversaries. He can increase the gravity acting on opponents to press them down under immense pressure, even going as far as to create large craters deep into the ground. Fujitora can also control the direction of his gravity, allowing him to generate \"horizontal\" gravity to attack with a tremendous outward force. Moreover, the admiral is able to employ his power defensively by making fields of seemingly reverse gravity to repel attacks. He can also use the gravity to pull objects directly toward himself, with the field of gravity being capable of reaching (possibly) into outer space, which Fujitora has used multiple times to summon meteorites to strike his opponents. By negating gravity entirely, Issho can enact the controlled levitation of nonliving objects around him. He has been shown levitating a battleship to move himself and his men more quickly over the sea, as well as floating a small rock to use as a personal mobile platform to stand and ride around on, achieving effective flight. As a marine admiral, Fujitora is a highly skilled Haki user. Fujitora is a highly skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, being able to clash head-on with Sabo, a Logia user who himself is proficient with this Haki. Fujitora can focus a strong concentration of Haki into his sword, rendering it obsidian-black and strong enough to defend against the razor-sharp string bars of Doflamingo's Torikago, which can easily slice up cannonballs and stone buildings. Fujitora possesses masterful skill in Kenbunshoku Haki, which he uses to compensate for his blindness in battle, and his incredible skill gives him a strong sense of danger. He can accurately predict fast (and surprise) attacks from enemies, like an unexpected kick from Doflamingo, and generally handle combat against extremely strong, fast, and agile enemies without apparent difficulty. Most notably, Fujitora is capable of perceiving living beings around him as images in his \"mind's eye\" (represented as colored, person-shaped auras on a dark background), in a way unimpaired by his blindness. Additionally, Fujitora has demonstrated the ability to read and hear the true thoughts and emotions of other people, which made him aware, for example, that the Dressrosa citizenry bore no ill will towards Luffy while \"chasing\" him out of their country. Fujitora's main weapon of choice is an unnamed Meito, a shikomizue that is a katana contained in a cane and acting as his walking stick."},

This extended to his fellow zombies as well; even if he stopped one from attacking a woman, Inuppe would not harm a female zombie, no matter what she looked like. Though he did not know why he was protecting a woman he was supposed to be hunting, Inuppe would go as far as to challenge Absalom in order to prevent him from pursuing her. However, as with all zombies who complete a past erasure contract with Gecko Moria, Inuppe eventually lost Sanji's memories of his fellow Straw Hat Pirates, as well as his emotions, and became completely obedient toward his masters, to the point of attacking Nico Robin, something Sanji himself would never do, and jumping out of a tower if ordered to do so.", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to Gecko Moria and his crew not connecting Sanji to his badly-drawn wanted poster and thus not knowing the power that his bounty implied, Sanji's shadow was not given a body strong enough to bring out his full power.

Working in tandem with Jigoro, Inuppe managed to subdue Tony Tony Chopper and Nico Robin, both highly skilled Devil Fruit users, and shortly afterward clashed evenly with Jigoro himself despite the latter being a General Zombie. As a zombie, Inuppe could not feel pain. In addition, he possessed considerable endurance, having quickly recovered from being smashed into a wall by Lola despite his relatively weak body, and was durable enough to match Jigoro's sword attacks with kicks and not be injured. Like Sanji, Inuppe fought exclusively with kicks; though he did not use any techniques exclusive to the Black Leg Style, a single kick from him was powerful enough to defeat the Vice-Commander of the Wild Zombies snap a large axe in two, and evenly match a sword strike from Jigoro."},

He wears a small pair of blue sunglasses and has shoulder-length black ears, a white beard, and a large and bushy tail. Like all the retainers of the Kozuki Family, Inuarashi bears the family crest somewhere on his body. During the battle against Jack, he wore a dark-colored striped suit with a frilled collar, a belt, a light-colored cape, and a helmet. After waking from his coma, he wore a king-like robe, and his head and torso were covered in bandages. While being tortured by Jack, Inuarashi lost his left leg. Later, during the Raid on Onigashima, it is revealed that he has replaced it with a sword.", "personality": "Inuarashi is a kind, noble, and humble mink who is deeply loved and respected by his people due to his great benevolence. He was eager to meet the Straw Hat Pirates after they saved the Mink Tribe, indicating a grateful personality, and he downplayed his strength when he was complimented by Luffy. Inuarashi has a very refined and sophisticated personality as he is very polite and soft-spoken in speech. He refers to himself with \"watashi\" and always speaks to people including enemies in a very courteous manner. Due to his gentleman sophistication, Inuarashi strongly dislikes barbarism, as he was greatly shocked by Jack's completely unreasonable and violent nature. He also holds strong contempt for Nekomamushi, who he insultingly called a Monster Cat due to the latter's aggressive and wild personality. Despite being the strongest warrior on Zou, Inuarashi prefers diplomacy over aggression when dealing with hostile parties. He cares immensely for his people and their rich cultural history, to the extent that he was willing to lay down his sword to reason with Jack and the Beasts Pirates and would have allowed them to search for Raizo if they ceased their attack. During the brutal interrogation by the Beast Pirates for Raizo's whereabouts, Inuarashi pleaded with Jack and his men to spare his citizens from their brutality despite being subjected to horrendous torture himself. However, he is also firmly loyal and possesses an incredibly strong will, having absolutely refused to reveal Raizo's presence on Zou despite the brutal torture at the hands of Jack even when he lost his leg, and was fully willing to risk the kingdom's destruction in order to protect his friend. Like the rest of the canine minks, Inuarashi finds Brook to be delicious because of his body of bones, but was willing to let him recover and chew on him later after seeing his injuries.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the former two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Inuarashi held a large amount of influence over the Mink Tribe, and acted as the main authority figure during daytime. Inuarashi had full authority over the members of the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad, including the combat force delegated to Shishilian, Concelot, and Giovanni, who all took their orders directly from him, before he stepped down from his position. Inuarashi is just as strong as his nightime counterpart and friend Nekomamushi, causing all of their battles to end in stalemates. According to Wanda, he is his country's strongest warrior. Inuarashi fought evenly against Jack, an All-Star of the Beasts Pirates with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, before the latter poisoned him with Caesar Clown's Koro gas. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, Inuarashi (in his Sulong form) was able to seriously injure the Emperor Kaidou in his dragon form. Alongside Nekomamushi, Inuarashi is one of the two strongest minks of the Mokomo Dukedom. He possesses immense physical strength and durability, having stopped Jack's enormous trunk, which destroyed a building in a single swing moments before, with one hand. He has great levels of endurance as he fought against Jack and his replenishing forces for five days, taking 12-hour intervals to recover, and still managed to survive exposure to the Koro gas and an entire day of torture, which included the loss of his left leg. Even after being brutally defeated by Kaidou, Inuarashi still retained enough strength to lift Jack, in his Human-Beast Form, over his shoulder and toss him through a wall. Like all minks, he can use Electro. It is unknown how much the loss of his leg affects his overall combat abilities, but he managed to clash evenly with a one-armed Nekomamushi; their clash created a shockwave powerful enough to blow the surrounding minks away. Similarly, he fought the mighty Ashura Doji to a draw. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Inuarashi can awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Inuarashi's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified. Along with Nekomamushi, he could take out multiple members of the Beast Pirates and completely overwhelm Jack and would have killed him if Kaidou had not intervened. Using this form is risky as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long. However, he can revert to his normal form by blocking his eyes from the moonlight. As the commander of the Musketeers, Inuarashi is an extremely skilled swordsman. He can enhance his swordsmanship by infusing his rapier with Electro, which he used to hold his own against Jack in his full mammoth form and, in the anime, performed strong defensive blocks to defend against Jack's attacks with his sword. Inuarashi's sword skills are advanced enough to clash with Nekomamushi's spear skills. After adding a sword to replace his missing leg, he quickly adapted to a two-sword style. While in Sulong form, Inuarashi was able to inflict considerable injury to Kaidou in his dragon form. Inuarashi is capable of emulating Oden's signature Oden Two Sword Style style, allowing him to wield two swords and perform one of his techniques. He is even capable of using a more personal version known as Oden One Sword Style. Inuarashi wields a rapier, which he can channel Electro through. While dueling Ashura Doji, he wielded a katana. He later attached a sword to his missing leg, allowing him to wield two blades together. Against Kaidou, he used both his rapier and katana together to perform Oden's signature technique. Inuarashi possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. He can harden his swords and also has an advanced level of this Haki, as shown when he cut through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin. Inuarashi possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Despite this, Imu seems to have a calm demeanor, as shown when they gently handled the butterflies in the Room of Flowers; though in that same moment, Imu was also shown to have left the aforementioned pictures (save for Vivi's) pierced through and cut apart by weapons. Imu has demonstrated greater cruelty and apathy than the Five Elders. While the Elders tend to feel hesitant about ordering mass executions to protect their secrecy, Imu annihilates entire islands in order to erase them from history with pure enthusiasm. This immense callousness is best evidenced by Imu ordering the destruction of Lulusia Kingdom purely to field test the Mother Flame, completely disregarding the lives of its inhabitants, solely due to the close proximity of the target island. Despite their existence being meant to be secret from the world at large, Imu is not above revealing themselves to individuals of interest, as with Nefertari Cobra when he questioned the lost records of his ancestor and Ohara's scholars. However, Imu and the Five Elders had no intention of letting Cobra leave the room alive after Imu showed themselves. Likewise, when Sabo appeared and attacked, Imu was furious that their existence was revealed to an outsider. When confronting Cobra, Imu was initially polite in their speech and offered to explain what the Will of D. actually meant, but quickly became much more hostile when talking about the subject of the Poneglyphs. Likewise, Imu has an intense hatred of those who bear the Will of D., as the moment Imu discovered Cobra's ancestor was a D., Imu immediately attempted to kill him. Imu uses the unique first-person pronoun \"Mu\" (, M?) seemingly derived from their name, as well as the unique second-person pronoun nushia (?) for others.", "abilities_and_powers": "The full scope of Imu's abilities and power is unknown, but the fact that they sit upon the Empty Throne, a seat whose occupant would be associated with sole authority over the entire world, plus the fact that the Five Elderswho are publicly considered the World Government's highest authoritiesbow down before Imu and address them with a great honorific, indicates that Imu indeed holds the highest authority within the World Government. However, their power seems limited in so far as they cannot publicly exert their authority, thus electing to direct the Five Elders to act out their will instead, by proxy. Imu can order the deployment of an immensely powerful weapon called \"Mother Flame\", which was built by Dr. Vegapunk and can affect the total annihilation of an entire island within seconds. Imu has shown the ability to transform themself into a massive, beast-like, yet humanoid creature capable of consuming fire, as well as control what appears to be a sharp-pointed, arrowhead-shaped appendage or tentacle used for impalement, strong enough to severely injure even the Logia user Sabo. It is unknown if this ability stems from a Zoan-type Devil Fruit power. Imu possesses a saber. They have not been seen being used in combat, but they did use it to cut apart wanted posters and photographs or stab them."},

It seems that in his twenty years, he did not change much in appearance, aside from his scarf being orange with a lined pattern, and he did not wear glasses on top of his forehead.", "personality": "Indigo is a doctor with an eccentric personality: he has a distinct laugh which goes \"Piro piro piro\", adorns shoes that emit sounds of flatulence whenever walking, not caring if others gets irritated by this, and also often tries to act like a mime, but usually breaks character by suddenly talking, though ironically becomes completely surprised if someone actually understood his charade type speech. He also appears to be careful, as he always carries around a vial of antidote to the Draft disease, just for precaution.", "abilities_and_powers": "Indigo is a chemist. He was the one in charge in the development of Shiki's scheme involving all the monstrous animals, and was the one who developed the SIQ serum. He is a strong fighter who was able to fight along side Shiki and his crew when they fought against the Roger Pirates. He is possibly a proficient swordsman, as he was seen attacking Luffy with a sword fitting his size, and wielding it during the battle in Shiki's palace. Indigo is also a skilled dancer, taking part in all of his captain's little \"dance shows\". Indigo has the ability to produce explosive chemical orbs from his body and attack with them, a power he calls \"Chemical Juggling\" (, Kemikaru Jaguringu?). He can create bright green and purple chemical orbs somewhat similar to Will-o'-the-wisps, that are then arranged above him and shot from his hands one after another, in rapid succession, causing powerful explosions. He can also apparently condense his orbs into a larger one with a far more explosive effect, which he calls \"Mass Juggling\" (, Masu Jaguringu?), that, although much more effective than his ordinary attack, needs more time to reach critical mass. The way he manipulates the chemicals resembles the skill of Juggling, befitting his clown-like appearance. Due to Indigo being able to pull himself out of a pool of water after falling in, he is obviously not a Devil Fruit user. Instead, it appears that this ability stems from some sort of chemical he used on himself, also seen when, after being defeated by Zoro, he got enveloped by his own flames and exploded, such loss of control of own powers was only seen with Foxy at the Davy Back Fight, when Luffy redirected Foxy's Noro Noro Beam to him and he was slowed down by his own power."},

His face is often seen curved into a sinister expression. He wears a light-colored shirt, dark-colored pants, small ring-shaped earrings, long boots ending in a cuff, and a Shimenawa-like rope around his waist like a belt.

Inazuma has clothes and hair that is orange on one side and white on the other. On top of Inazuma's forehead, there is a distinct lightning bolt shaped scar that goes over Inazuma's right eye. Usually Inazuma is seen with a glass of wine being held in his left hand, and sporting a particular pose, even while fighting, and even continues to hold the wine glass while using his Devil Fruit ability. As a man, Inazuma has his glasses on regularly. His jaw and body are also quite rectangular in shape. As a woman, Inazuma wears her glasses on top of her forehead, her jaw and body are also more rounded in shape, and the scar seems to move more towards the right side of her head. Inazuma also has a noticeable habit of keeping his free hand out and flat besides him despite gender. It should also be noted that Inazuma is one of the few (if not the only) okama to be depicted in a relatively normal manner without any of the excessively flamboyant characteristics or Drag Queen dressing and make up (or actually, no make-up at all), prevalent amongst okamas in One Piece.", "personality": "As a man, Inazuma is mostly serious, calm and level-headed, almost emotionless. He only shows emotions during critical moments, such as relief when he thought that Ivankov survived his battle against Magellan, and panic moments later when he realized that Ivankov had been defeated by Magellan. As a woman, Inazuma is warm and cheerful, in sharp contrast with her male persona. Also, regardless of gender, Inazuma seems to lack the general flamboyant disposition of an okama unlike most of the other okamas depicted in One Piece. As either personality, he is very loyal to Ivankov and will usually do nothing until given an order.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a deputy commander of the Revolutionary Army, Inazuma boasts significant authority within the organization. Within the G Army, his authority is second only to his direct superior, Ivankov. Inazuma is an accomplished fighter who is capable of fighting while still maintaining his somewhat jaunty pose and holding his glass of wine. Though he appears to primarily fight with his Devil Fruit powers, he is also a proficient physical fighter, proven when he sent a wolf from the ferocious Wolf Unit flying with a kick. Even the Level 6 prisoners compliment his skills. Inazuma ate the Choki Choki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to transform parts of his body into scissors. His scissors can cut through any solid material, no matter how durable, including stone and metal. He can manipulate anything he snips with his scissors as though it were made of paper. In addition to simply attacking his opponents with his scissor blades, he can cut through things around him to give himself an advantage, such as by cutting a staircase down so that his enemies cannot follow him. He can use this power to manipulate the terrain; by cutting the ground into strips, he can attack his opponent by hurling the strips at them. He can also swing them upright, allowing him to create a protective wall. Additionally, he can use a strip of ground to make a bridge connecting two points."},

He has a widow's peak, sharply edged facial features, and dark eyeliner surrounding his eyes, with large eyelashes on his lower eyelid, and a bulging vein on the side of his head. As a member of the Longarm Tribe, he possesses very long arms, with an extra elbow joint; unusually for a Longarm, he keeps the extra joint extended past his shoulders over his head. This is usually to power up the force of his punches, but if he needs to, Ideo can relocate these joints to their ordinary configuration to give his arms extra range. He has his ear pierced three times and has four black crosses tattooed on his chest. In the manga, he is shown sporting a green jacket, with a white stripe coming down each arm. He also wears matching shorts, a large belt, and knee pads. Ideo also has bandages wrapped around his calves and feet, along with red gloves.

He can also be quite merciless, as he had no qualms about attacking an already unconscious opponent. Unlike most of the people who were freed from Sugar's curse, Ideo was not shown to be swayed by greed as he chose to fight the Donquixote Pirates instead of their enemies, even attacking those who tried to claim the bounties. During his fight with Dellinger, Ideo showed that he valued honor as he promised to hold the officer off long enough for Luffy to defeat Doflamingo. Ideo also mentioned that by repaying his debt to the Straw Hats, he would be able to show his face to those who went before him, showing a great sense of determination and pride. Ideo later shows that he does not possess the same ill will towards those of the Longleg Tribe, not even having a problem with one of his crewmates being a member of that tribe.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Ideo Pirates he has complete authority over his crew. Ideo is extremely skilled in boxing, being an XXX rank boxer and was a two-time champion of the New World Central Fighting Tournament. He became one of the finalists in the C Block of the Corrida Colosseum battle royale.He was able to face off against Sai, the 13th Commander of the Happo Navy.However, he was effortlessly defeated by Dellinger. Ideo has extraordinary physical strength. He uses a punching technique wherein he delivers a hit that explodes on impact. His punches are apparently powerful enough to send the massive body of the unconscious Hajrudin flying with a single strike. Being a member of the Longarm Tribe gives him arms with an extra joint and length. He kept the extra joints quasi-hidden by extending them past his shoulders, allowing him to hide them for a surprise attack, stretching them out when necessary for the extra reach and strike. This compression of his shoulders gives him the extra strength to add that explosive power to his punches. In the Corrida Colosseum, Ideo took down multiple powerful gladiators with great ease. He even fought on equal level with Sai, a powerful master of the Hasshoken, and was only taken out by Chinjao due to him being pre-occupied with fighting Sai. Ideo has shown to possess great endurance. Even after being brutally pierced in the stomach by Dellinger and bleeding profusely, Ideo retained enough strength to grab Dellinger with one arm. He even withstood several powerful kicks from Dellinger without releasing his grip on Dellinger and only succumbed when Dellinger brutally bit him on his shoulder.

He usually keeps his pet mouse, Tyrannosaurus, in a pocket on the left side of his jacket, caressing his little head with his right hand. During his youth, he had longer hair, almost reaching his shoulders, and was usually seen with a white bandanna; he wore simpler clothes, consisting of a brown T-shirt, beige pants and black shoes. Flashbacks to his youth also show that he has purple tattoos on both shoulders, though these have not been seen in the present since he typically wears long-sleeved shirts.", "personality": "Iceburg is the mayor of Water 7 as well as president of the Galley-La Company, and thus the most important person in the city. However, he is by no means haughty: on his first appearance, he personally accompanied Luffy, Usopp and Nami around Dock 1, showing them the place, and he was seen talking informally and with pleasure with one of the shipwrights in his employ. Both his subordinates and his citizens show an incredible love for him, so it could be assumed that he's an excellent leader. Iceburg at times seems to act rather childish, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he does not like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. (He currently has a mouse that he named \"Tyrannosaurus\"). However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed. He also has a tendency to say, \"Nmaa\" or \"Oh my\" (\"Mwell\" in the FUNimation dub) whenever he talks. Iceburg is a person who is against making weapons because he believes they are meant to hurt people even if the person who made them has no ill intent as shown when he kept telling Franky to stop making his battleships during their younger years. As a shipwright, Iceburg has a deep understanding and sympathy for ships, as he saw the Going Merry was well taken care of despite the accumulated terminal damage it has incurred. He complied with the ship's plea to repair it for one more journey despite not fully knowing if the voice was real and that it was already beyond any hope, and upon witnessing Merry sailing on its own, Iceburg was determined to see this miracle up close that he would risk sailing through the Aqua Laguna.", "abilities_and_powers": "Iceburg is the Mayor of Water 7 and the CEO of Galley-La, the company he united together single-handedly, overall giving him complete control over the island. Having been personally taught by Tom, who was hailed as the greatest shipwright of his time, Iceburg is a brilliant shipwright like Franky. He was able to unite all the shipyards of Water 7 under his leadership to form the Galley-La Company, which is an organization of the finest shipwrights in the world. Iceburg later became one of the five who crafted the Thousand Sunny for the Straw Hat Pirates. His skills in naval architecture were already evident in his youth, when he helped in the construction of the Sea Train with Tom. He was also able to repair the failed prototype Sea Train Rocketman in time for the Straw Hats to use it to get to Enies Lobby within a short period of time, as well as fixing the Going Merry, which was already badly damaged beyond repair, to usable condition by himself in the midst of Aqua Laguna while still injured by the attack from the CP9. His understanding of naval architecture is great enough that he intends to convert the very city of Water 7 into a giant floating boat to overcome the future problems of Aqua Laguna. He has proven at different times to have great endurance and resistance, as seen when he was able to stand up after he and Tom endured a bombardment from the fleet of Battle Franky ships, which were powerful enough to kill a Sea King, and when he went to the station to check the Rocketman after receiving severe injuries from the CP9.

Each pair of arms seems to have a corresponding pair of pectorals, as eight of them are visible on his chest. He has a long beard complete with a mustache, white skin, and a bulbous nose. On both his topmost forearms and on his belly he bears swirl-like tattoos, and on his right shoulder is tattooed the New Fish-Man Pirates' Jolly Roger. Underneath his helmet is his hair that is in the shape of a spear that he will use as a last resort. He wears a round helmet with goggles, with a dark stripe on top of it, and a large loop earring on each ear. He's bare-chested, but has a pair of suspenders-like belts reaching down from both of his shoulders to his waist. These are attached to a pair of rings, supporting some sort of light apron around his waist; he also dons dark pants reaching down below his knees and sandals. Each of his arms has a bolted wristband and holding a long spear with a tassel right below the head. As a teenager, he did not have a beard, his lips appeared larger and his eyes rounder, he wore a different, more elaborate round helmet, with a crest on its top and no goggles, paired with a simple vest. He also carried around a single pole-arm, instead of eight. Due to the negative effects of the Energy Steroids, his body became old and weak with his hair turning grey which now reaches the back of his neckand his beard becoming even longer as well. He also became very skinny.", "personality": "He has a habit of saying \"Much\" at the end of sentences. Like Hody Jones and the other officers, he follows Arlong's ideals and despises humans as well as Queen Otohime's ideals. He was shown to be brutal as he used threats to force the Fish-Man Island citizens to step on the fumi-e of Otohime. Like Hody, Ikaros does not have any care for his comrades as he did not think twice about using his spears on one of them for accidentally using fire in his vicinity. However, that seems to apply only to the lower-rank subordinates since Ikaros showed concern for Hody as he was suffering from an overdose of Energy Steroids. Because of a traumatizing event, when his giant squid friend Daidalos died from dehydration by being too close to the sun, Ikaros has developed severe pyrophobia, and would instinctively curl up backwards when exposed to flames, in reference to dried squids. In related matter, Ikaros would also curl over like this when something else shocking appears in front of him, such as Nami deactivating her invisibility, and he seemingly despises the mentioning of dried squids, as he was annoyed when Luffy called the kraken \"Surume\" (dried squid).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Ikaros has command over lower-ranking crew members. Ikaros possesses tremendous willpower, being completely unfazed by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki burst. Being a fish-man, he is born ten times stronger than an average human, and double that underwater. However, being an officer, as well as a massive kind of fish-man, he may be stronger than that. It was also implied by the citizens of Fish-Man Island that even his species alone was enough to be feared. His multiple arms allow him to rapidly strike his targets with sheer numerous strikes. Being a squid fish-man, Ikaros is also able to generate and manipulate ink, using it to create ink-clones. However, after the negative effects of the Energy Steroids took effect, he became weak and old, stripping him of all his strength. He is seen wielding eight spears, known as the Dried Squid Spears (, Surume Ika no Yari?), one in each hand. He has yet to use them in extended combat, but may be proficient at using them; even their sheer number, however, might seemingly grant him the upper hand against most enemies. The heads of the spears are actually dried squids that suck the water out of anyone they pierce and turn back into normal squids in the process, as demonstrated when Ikaros stabs an offender. The weakness of these spears is that they utilize their function against enemies who do not have any bodily moisture content to absorb, such as the skeletal Brook or Franky when he was inside his exoskeleton. Like the rest of the crew, Ikaros has taken the Energy Steroids during the battle against the three princes of Ryugu Kingdom, who are crowned the strongest soldiers in the entire island, and was able to overpower them due to this. The drug doubles his strength per pill, but shaves off a portion of his lifespan. This also had another side effect of making him old and weak after he was arrested, which made him lose the strength he naturally had."},

When given the chance to submit to Orochi, he refused, yearning for the old days when honorable people were still alive. As such, due to his absolute dedication to samurai's honor, pride, loyalty, and chivalry, he was completely disgusted and infuriated to see Orochi's subordinates switch allegiance to Kaidou right after Orochi was decapitated by Kaidou. After spending a long time in the prison, he became broken down physically and mentally, although he still voiced his disappointment with his lack of food despite such an attitude being punishable. However, when Luffy gave him more dango, Hyogoro took the pirate's honor very seriously and made no secret of his new fortune, being willing to accept death for it because of how it fulfilled his memories of the past.

At his best, Hyogoro was quite a powerful warrior, respected by countless samurais, Yakuzas, and even Orochi and Kaido; wanted to recruit him into his ranks. In fact, before the confrontation between Oden and the pirate, the latter stated that if the samurai had allied with Hyogoro five years earlier, he and his crew would have been at a clear disadvantage against the nation's samurai.

Hyogoro has exceptional endurance despite his old age, as he could withstand an Artificial Zoan Devil Fruit enhanced Gifter, Daifugo's brutally kicking him without spitting out the food Luffy offered him. This, when combined with his superior Busoushoku Haki skills, allowed him to survive getting sent flying and crashing deep into a wall by Emperor Big Mom, which is an incredible feat by itself, as Big Mom is powerful enough to destroy cities, sink battleships, and even kill a strong giant as a child with just her bare hands. In spite of suffering this injury, he is able to fight the Beasts Pirates later on. Hyogoro has displayed great agility in spite of his old age. He was able to avoid the sword attacks of Alpacaman and counterattack fairly easily, though he did have Luffy's future vision to tell him what would happen next. Hyogoro has shown incredible willpower, able to resist the feral berserker effects of the Ice Oni virus from affecting his mind through sheer will, exploiting the strength enhancement effects to his advantage, shockingly impressed Apoo and Drake. Becoming infected by the Ice Oni virus granted Hyogoro the return of the strength of his prime, though in exchange for his lifespan. With this, he was able to easily decimate many Beasts Pirates and the entire ex-Mimawarigumi as well as the Orochi Oniwabanshu. Even the arrogant Queen saw him as a real threat, believing he could take down everything in his path. Hyogoro is an extremely skilled and experienced Busoshoku Haki user, which is called \"Ryuo\" in Wano. He can harden parts of his body and can utilize an advanced application of Busoshoku Haki that allows him to emit his Haki a short distance without a medium. It is strong enough to strike down a Gifter without touching him. He also withstood an attack from Big Mom by guarding himself with Busoshoku Haki. He was skilled enough as a teacher to teach Luffy in the same advanced technique. In the anime, when Hyogoro uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a pink colored flowing aura. Hyogoro possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki as he sensed Luffy's presence on top of the Skull Dome and realized he was still alive. Hyogoro is an extremely skilled veteran Samurai who learned the concept of Wano, where one wield their sword as an extension of their will, choosing what he does and does not want to cut. Despite his old age, malnourished body, and spending twenty years imprisoned in Udon, he managed to dispatch dozens of Beasts Pirates easily using his sword, then participated in the Raid on Onigashima. When his original strength was briefly restored to him, Hyogoro managed to defeat the captains of the Mimawarigumi and the Orochi Oniwanbanshi with his swordsmanship. 20 years ago, Hyogoro wielded a long thin katana. He regained his sword after joining the rebellion."},

{"name": "Hyouzou", "episode": "Episode 607", "chapter": "Chapter 527", "year": 2010, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 610.", "appearance": "Being an octopus merman, Hyouzou has six massive orange octopus tentacles in place of legs with large motifs vaguely reminiscent of eyes on them. He has a standard, slim pink upper body and two human arms that serve as his seventh and eighth limb respectively. He hasmedium-length black hair styled in dreadlocks. He's usually seen with a sleepy expression and an unusually large mouth that protrudes out from his face. He usually has a toothpick in his mouth, wears a blue unbuttoned shirt with the sleeves rolled up, an untied tie hanging around his neck over his chest, and a jacket which is draped over his shoulders like a cape. His left arm is usually pulled through from his shirt and is seen holding a katana that lacks a guard and is kept in a sheath covered in elongated spot motifs. Hyouzou also carries around a gourd that he often drinks his alcohol from. After overdosing on Energy Steroids, his appearance changes (like Hody) with his hair turning white and slicked back. After the negative effects of the Energy Steroids appeared, his body became old and weak with his hair now unkempt and shaggy and he grew a new beard.", "personality": "Hyouzou has a laid-back and calm demeanor. He seems to be annoyed by noisy people, as is evident by his distaste toward the ruckus made by the Mermaids of the cove. He likes to drink and when he gets drunk, he will blindly attack anyone around him, whether enemies or allies. He has an evident interest in money, being a mercenary for hire who ends up only working for those of the highest bidder, to the point that he would not even help Arlong invade East Blue because the Fish-Man was tight with his money and would not pay his fee. Apparently, he's not interested in the goals of the faction he's working for, as long as he receives payment. However, although he has no interest in the goals of the New Fish-Man Pirates, he is shown to be very efficient when he does have a client as shown when he forced the Fish-Man Island citizens to comply with the New Fish-Man Pirates. Since he was hired help, he himself did not share as much of the same views as others working for Hody, but was no better due to his role in life. Despite priding himself as the best swordsman of Fish-Man Island, he does not seem to have the honor of one, as he tried to kill Zoro with a sneak attack from behind, which has often been referred as a shame for a swordsman. He can be angered when he is insulted, as shown during his fight with Zoro when his opponent called him a \"frog\". He is well acquainted with Hatchan, and seems to look down on him for the Fish-Man's skills in swordsmanship and says Arlong would have taken him if it was not for his money problems. He apparently has developed a sense of intrigue with Luffy, as he stated he thought it would be a shame if Luffy died from his poison. He can be sarcastic since he claimed that he felt bad for Arlong for recruiting Hatchan. After his transformation from Energy Steroids overdose, his personality changes: even when drunk, bystanders note that he has seemingly developed a lust to cut anything - even his own allies - as opposed to simply attacking blindingly. Despite his lack of interest in the New Fish-Man Pirates' goals of extreme misanthropy, he was willing to use large amounts of Energy Steroids to accomplish his goals, knowing that it would shorten his lifespan; he showed the dangerous move of mixing alcohol (depressant) with drugs (stimulant) together.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to his defeat and rapid aging, Hyouzou was a mercenary, the strongest swordsman on Fish-Man Island, and the assassin of the New Fish-Man Pirates. He claimed he was not assisting them for common goals, but simply because he was hired for it: the fact that the crew resorted to hire a merman mercenary tells a lot about Hyouzou's abilities. Even though he is a freelancer assassin for the crew, he still appeared to be an officer of his crew. Just like the other officers, he led a squad of their crew during their takeover of the island, and when the other officers were arrested and imprisoned, Hyouzou was alongside them instead of the lower-ranking members, who were merely sentenced to work off their debt to society. He also has a very strong will, as he was completely unaffected by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki blast. Hyouzou was one of the strongest members of the New Fish-Man Pirates. He couldblock Luffy's punch (even though he was still greatly pushed back by the attack's sheer force), showing off incredible speed, given that Luffy was in Gear 2 mode at the time, and stamina, as he was able to walk away without any visible injuries while carrying his unconscious companions. He could apply extreme force in his swordsmanship, easily taking down several Fish-Men who were noted to have superior physical strength to that of regular humans. While Luffy himself acknowledged Hyouzou as a strong individual, Zoro on the other hand did not consider Hyouzou as a worthy opponent, effortlessly defeating Hyouzou even though the mercenary was powered by Energy Steroids and had his swords coated in his own poison. Hyouzou is capable of secreting venom from his tentacles and poisoning his opponents through a mere, short-lasting physical touch, as Luffy was poisoned by rapidly punching him. His venom is dark green in the anime. Hyouzou was subsequently concerned that his poison might have killed the Straw Hats' captain (Chopper confirmed it was deadly poison when testing Luffy's blood); Luffy, however, easily fought it off, due to being exposed to a variety of intense poisons during his fight with Magellan two years earlier. Also, as a merman, he is a fast swimmer. However, after the negative effects of the Energy Steroids took effect, he became weak and old, stripping him of all strength, save for his poison which is natural to the type of merman he is. Hyouzou can become stronger by drinking alcohol, being referred to as a drunken assassin. While in a heavily drunken state, his physical strength and speed significantly increased to the point he can easily take down multiple Fish-Men at once with little effort. Hyouzou was the strongestswordsmanon Fish-Man Island and a master of Eight Sword Style. Hyouzou showed fearsome versatility and power in his swordsmanship, greatly surpassing Hatchan, a highly skilled octopus swordsman, swinging three swords to easily take down members of the New Fish-Man Pirates, and in the anime cut apart and demolished an entire building with his sword skills. His last resort appears to be coating his eight swords with his deadly venom. However, after his defeat and rapid aging by the Energy Steroids, it is unlikely he is capable of any swordsmanship close to the level he could do when he was younger. Like the rest of the crew, Hyouzou had taken the Energy Steroids during the battle against the three princes of Ryugu Kingdom, who are crowned the strongest soldiers in the entire island, and was able to overpower them due to this. The drug doubles his strength per pill, but shaves off a portion of his lifespan. After he overdosed on Energy Steroids, he underwent a transformation similar to Hody, in which his hair turned white, and was afterwards able to cut iron with ease. The pills, however, had another side effect of making him old and weak after he was arrested, which causes him to lose all the strength he naturally had. Hyouzou uses a katana and seven sabers for combat."},

However, Hotei was not faithful to Orochi as an individual, as once the shogun was beheaded by Kaidou, the Mimawarigumi captain unhesitatingly switched his allegiance to the latter, when given the option of submission or death, going against the standard samurai code of loyalty.

She has been shown to be a respectful and rational person, calmly admitting her loss after trying to capture Luffy. Hina seems to be quite knowledgeable on historical facts as she mentioned the legendary Rocks Pirates, whose existence is only more commonly known among older marines, such as Garp and Sengoku, rather than most marines of her generation.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hina has proven to be quite perceptive, as she was able to see through Miss Goldenweek's, Mr. 5's, and Miss Valentine's disguises by looking at their wanted posters. She is a skilled unarmed combatant and was able, with the aid of her Devil Fruit, to defeat Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, an extremely powerful hand-to-hand fighter, in a one-on-one battle on two separate occasions. Hina ate the Ori Ori no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to create iron bars and create iron bindings on her opponents. This power earned her the nickname \"Hina the Black Cage\". She can place restraints on people by swiping her limbs through them, as the victims passes through her body, the body part they pass through turns into an iron restraint, leaving them trapped in a ring of iron. The body part she uses regenerates immediately. She can also extend long iron cage bars from her body which she can use to strike at her opponents. These bars are able to wrap around and trap anyone who interacts with them, friend and foe alike. This allows Hina to bind multiple people at once.

He also possessed some cunning, keeping a smoke-bomb ready for emergency escapes and reasoning that nobody would anticipate a mountain bandit like himself hiding out at sea.

{"name": "Hattori", "episode": "Episode 323", "chapter": "Chapter 230", "year": 2004, "note": "", "appearance": "Hattori is a white pigeon and is always seen wearing a light red tie while Lucci was undercover as a shipwright and a black one afterwards. He wore a light green coat identical to his master's while Lucci wore his during the Sea Train ride to Enies Lobby and the meeting at the Tower of Justice. After the timeskip, Hattori wears a white coat and hat resembling those worn by Lucci, though with the addition of a white necktie.", "personality": "Why Hattori is with Lucci is unknown considering the man's reputation as a heartless mass-murderer, though Lucci has had him since he was a child. He apparently is not afraid of Lucci and is very loyal to him, as he stays close to his master even in dangerous situations like the Buster Call. He even attempted to bandage him after his fight with Luffy and was happy when Lucci finally woke up in the hospital in St. Poplar. When Lucci is not fighting, Hattori is usually perched on his master's right shoulder. Lucci would have had to express some emotions to blend in with citizens while undercover, but Hattori did this for him as his ventriloquist dummy; this allowed Lucci to be somewhat sociable while at the same time remain emotionless. While Hattori reverts to being an ordinary pigeon after Lucci was revealed to be an assassin, he occasionally exhibits human traits such as drinking from a cup.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hattori does not seem to have any combat abilities, and in battle, tends to fly out of the way, generally hovering around in a circle like a bird of prey until the fight is over. He does, however, seem to be incredibly intelligent, able to understand human mannerisms and can mimic them as part of Rob Lucci's ventriloquism act in Water 7, such as moving his beak in sync with Lucci's words and moving his wings around like human arms, as well as facial expressions. He was also seen wearing a coat, holding a glass and drinking like a human."},

He wears a green and white 16th century-style ruffed outfit with white tights and carries a saber whose hand guard resembles the ruffles of his shirt.", "personality": "Haruta was loyal to Whitebeard, and wanted to save Portgas D. Ace at Marineford. Haruta cried when Ace died, showing that he cared for him.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the 12th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Haruta has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. He is presumably very strong: this statement was bolstered when Jinbe remarked that all of the Whitebeard commanders have great strength.[citation needed] Haruta wields a decorated saber with a purple hilt, and appears to prefer a fighting style based on agility and speed, rather than strength, as he was seen jumping around when performing attacks. One demonstration of Haruta's level of swordsmanship is the fact that he is able to cut through steel."},
{"name": "Hasami", "episode": "Episode 176", "chapter": "Chapter 110", "year": 2001, "note": "His name was revealed by Nami in Chapter 180.", "appearance": "Hasami is a red-shelled crab the size of a small house, with a human-like mouth in a perpetual leer. His claws are sharply asymmetric, with the right being much larger than the left. While he aided the Straw Hats, he wore a pair of reins hooked to the corners of his mouth, and bore a thick green matting atop his shell; it remains unknown whether the latter was some sort of tarp, or naturally-growing plant life. Under the employment of Ukkari Hot-Spring Island, he now wears a howdah-esque carriage (large enough to hold dozens of average-sized humans) shaped after a bus driver's cap; its \"hatband\" is decorated with a scissors emblem, and equipped with a massive flashlight. His face also bears the resort's logoUKKARI bisected by an old-fashioned rendering of the kanji for bathwater (?).", "personality": "Unlike many of Arabasta's native animals, Hasami is completely docile, and quite willing to trust and help smaller creatures, including humans. Similar to his friend Matsuge, he has a lecherous interest in human women, and is easily \"energized\" by the sight of them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hasami's size is coupled with considerable speed, making him a highly effective draft animal able to carry numerous people over long distances. Like the rest of his species, however, he cannot swim in or tolerate water."},
{"name": "Hatcha", "episode": "Episode 981", "chapter": "Chapter 987", "year": 2020, "note": "He first appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 980.", "appearance": "Like the other Numbers, Hatcha is an enormous humanoid much larger than a typical giant, standing at a height of 66.8 meters. Like his fellow Numbers and most of the Beasts Pirates in general, Hatcha has a pair of horns atop his head. While some of the other Numbers have more animal-like features, Hatcha looks very humanoid, having peach skin, a set of rounded teeth and indigo hair arranged in a bowl cut. On the left side of his abdomen is a tattoo of the daiji \"\", which means eight. He wears a yellow track-jacket that remains unzipped, leaving his bare chest exposed, dark pants and light shoes with laces. He also possesses a pair of oval sunglasses.", "personality": "Like the other Numbers, Hatcha likes to drink. He seems to like fighting and quickly took the opportunity to attack Luffy, Zoro, Kid, and Killer when they broke into Kaidou's fortress, with his careless use of force resulting in collateral damage and members of his own crew going down. This recklessness caused his crewmates to try and stop him from attacking further, and Kid noted that they seemed to have trouble controlling him. Hatcha is attracted to the General Franky, seeming to view it as a toy and preferring to chase after it rather than fight his crew's enemies. Like the other Numbers, Hatcha has a unique laughter style that plays off his name and the number eight: \"Hachachacha\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "Due to his large size, Hatcha is extremely powerful, wielding his club to strike heavy blows. After somewhat sobering up, Hatcha was able to lift his fellow Number Jaki over his head with ease. The gigantification experiments also granted him a long lifespan akin to genuine giants, as he is currently 188 years old. Hatcha wields a massive, spiked club resembling a morning star, suiting his size. With casual swings he can easily crush, as well as blow large holes into thick layers of, stone and wooden floor."},
{"name": "Hatchan", "episode": "Episode 69", "chapter": "Chapter 31", "year": 1999, "note": "Also known by his nickname \"Hachi\".", "appearance": "Hatchan, being an octopus fish-man, has eight appendages (six arms and two legs) and an octopus-like face. He has pink skin and grey hair styled into five spikes. By the time he had become a takoyaki salesman, he had a second row of spikes. He has a muscular build and suction cups on his six arms, which he can use to cling on to walls. Hatchan has a tattoo in the shape of a sun on his forehead, as a result of being in the Sun Pirates. While most fish-men have webbed hands, octopus fish-men do not, as neither Hatchan nor Octopako have webbed hands. When first arriving at Cocoyasi Village, Hatchan wore a diamond-checkered outfit. In the Arlong Arc, he wore a striped outfit. Hatchan usually wears heavy clothing and shirts made especially for octopus fish-men. During the Sabaody Arc, he wore a jacket to cover his four extra arms and a bandage to cover his tattoo to prevent him from being captured and sold at the Human Auctioning House. When the Straw Hats arrive at Fish-Man Island, Hatchan wears a shirt from the Criminal brand.", "personality": "Hatchan is not very intelligent and can be easily duped, such as when he failed to recognize who Roronoa Zoro really was, and mistakenly begins to introduce himself while asking other people their names. He initially fails to understand Zoro's words during his battle about the difference in \"weight\" between their swords (he assumed Zoro meant weight as in \"heavy\", but Zoro was referring to weight as in \"burden\"). In his fight against Zoro, he made many misjudgments and even at some points allowed himself to get angry, which partly contributed to his defeat. By the time he meets the Straw Hats again near Sabaody Archipelago, his personality seems to have changed. He seems to be significantly more intelligent and very knowledgeable about the Sabaody Archipelago, though it is likely because he is quite familiar with it (he thought Duval and Sanji looked the same, and was still easily tricked by Sanji into revealing his true identity), and wisely cautions Luffy against provoking the World Nobles in spite of their cruelty. He has also become very ashamed for what he and the Arlong Pirates did to Nami and her village, and is genuinely sorry for what he did. Since then he has tried to atone for all of his past sins. Hatchan is also rather humble in comparison to other fish-men, often accepting that things are how they are and not wanting to upset others. He seemed to respect Arlong as a friend, going as far to support his ambitions by willingly joining his crew, a band of fish-men who hate humans, despite Hatchan himself not particularly despising or discriminating against humans. Hatchan is extremely kind and caring, as he frequently protected Camie and Pappag from being abducted by the Macro Pirates. During his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, he also restrained Arlong when he violently assaulted Koala out of annoyance. Hatchan also readily helped a town of catfish who were suffering from a famine by selling all his newly acquired treasure to buy cooking equipment and ingredients to feed them. Due to his kindness, Hatchan recognizes humans by their character instead of their race, as during his childhood, he saved Rayleigh from drowning in a shipwreck, becoming close friends with him and his wife Shakuyaku ever since. While he supported Arlong as his crewmate, Hatchan personally never engaged in any sort of cruel abuse towards the people of Cocoyasi Village like the rest of the Arlong Pirates, and even Nami vouched that Hatchan was the better one of the Arlong Pirates and that they should save him. Hatchan's childhood dream was to be accepted into the human society, and he admitted that Arlong's tyranny was going too far. Unlike Kuroobi and Chew, Hatchan alone was not corrupted by Arlong's ideals. After Luffy accepted Hatchan as a friend, he outright opposes Arlong's ideals, much to Hody Jones' disappointment.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hatchan can shoot streams of ink from his mouth like a true octopus in order to blind enemies, allowing him to strike them down while they cannot see. He also covered himself with the ink in a failed attempt to conceal his identity from the Straw Hat Pirates. Hatchan has a massive amount of strength as one of the top members of the Sun Pirates and an officer of the Arlong Pirates. He easily defeated the Macro Pirates, who were fish-men themselves, single-handedly and sent them flying with three-armed punches. His strength allows him to easily wield six extremely heavy cutlasses, each weighing over 300kg, while maintaining speed. Even when injured, he was the only fish-man from the Arlong Pirates to escape from the Marines. He is also aware of the existence of Haki, but admits that he knows very little about it. As a fish-man, Hatchan is an expert swimmer. Even as a child, he managed to save Rayleigh from drowning at sea during a shipwreck. Even after being seriously injured during the timeskip, resulting in him using crutches, Hatchan still displayed great swimming prowess and was able to swim a considerable distance before being struck down by the barrage of arrows that Decken sent at him after he marked Hatchan as his target. Hatchan seems to have incredible endurance, as he was able to survive getting slashed by Zoro's three swords and Sanji's kick. Hatchan also got up sooner than any of the other fish-man after getting beaten by Zoro. However, he had an advantage in both cases, as Zoro had been badly injured by Mihawk and Sanji's kick was under water, reducing his power and speed. Even when pierced by Decken's arrows and experiencing heavy blood loss, Hatchan still managed to swim back to Fish-Man Island to warn the Straw Hats of Hody's invasion. Hatchan is a highly skilled swordsman and a master of the Six Sword Style. As an Octopus Fish-Man with six arms, Hatchan can simultaneously wield six swords with great dexterity and versatility. He has stated that he is the second best swordsman in all of Fish-Man Island. Hyouzou stated that if Arlong did not have a \"tight-wallet\", he would not have settled for Hatchan. If he was still the second strongest swordsman on Fish-Man Island during the Fish-Man Island Arc, then he has become the strongest swordsman after the Energy Steroids made Hyouzou's body old and weak. Even Zoro had trouble when he fought him and barely won (though he was greatly limited by the wound he sustained from Mihawk). Using Six Sword Style, Hatchan could cut down members of the Flying Fish Riders while they were flying in mid air. For two years, Hatchan could fend off the Marines to protect the Thousand Sunny with Duval, the other members of the Rosy Life Riders, and Bartholomew Kuma. In the anime, he was able to create a tornado by flailing his swords wildly, similar to Zoro's Tatsumaki.[citation needed] Each of his swords is a cutlass that weighs over 300kg (661.387lbs), totaling to over 2 tons worth of metal, which is far more than a normal human's limit. During his adventures, Hatchan was given a golden trident by the Goldfish Princess for returning her ring. He showed proficiency in its usage by defeating a sea monster that was chasing a Seaboar. Hatchan is a highly skilled chef, having once roasted an entire pig to feed the Sea Cow Momoo. He is particularly masterful in cooking takoyaki, with his takoyaki being deeply appreciated by the Straw Hat Pirates, including Sanji, a master chef. Hatchan cooks takoyaki with great speed and dexterity. With his six arms, he could make large numbers of takoyaki to feed the Straw Hats, particularly Luffy, who has an enormous appetite."},

Originally, he wore his hair in a bizarre mushroom-shaped style, coupled with flashy leisure suits (and what appeared to be a rubber-band ring on his left hand). After his father was ousted from power, he was \"demoted\" to a standard Marine chore-boy uniform. Under the training of Vice-Admiral Garp, he became notably taller and more muscular. By the time he progressed to Chief Petty Officer, he started to wear his hair in a broad ponytail, coupled with a white shirt, pale green vest over it, purple slacks, black gloves, and a rather odd-looking black visor over his eyes. At his current rank of Lieutenant Commander, he has donned a brimmed white hat and junior Marine officer's overcoat. Unlike most other Marines of similar rank, he wears this coat conventionally (i.e. with arms in the sleeves).", "personality": "During his father's rule over the 153rd Branch and Shells Town, Helmeppo was a spoiled and obnoxious man, constantly exploiting anyone he could with threats of arrest and execution. Whenever his status failed to protect him, he would inevitably collapse into total cowardice. Even at his worst, however, he was notably sentimental, showing small mercies unknown to Morgan. He lost his luxurious life that he had under his father's rank after his father was kicked out. He was forced to become a chore boy alongside Koby, whose friendly approaches were turned down. Part of Helmeppo was still loyal to his father which was evident when he cried before his father's execution. However, he later realizes that his father is as brutal and murderous as the pirates, causing Helmeppo to oppose and disown him. This finally cut his last tie to his father and pushed him to change, becoming braver and less of a spoiled brat. Eventually, he and Koby become good friends. Helmeppo matures by the events of Water 7, even referring to his younger self as \"that bratty, selfish son who lived off his father's status\". Now a lieutenant commander alongside Koby, he continues his training in the Marines. He was deeply (and comically) upset when Zoro and Luffy did not recognize him. Helmeppo seems to be more levelheaded than Koby when it comes down to analyzing situations, as Koby is more aggressive. After the time skip, he has developed a penchant for being overly formal, even with Koby.", "abilities_and_powers": "In the beginning, Helmeppo was a typical weakling who relied on his father's status to get whatever he wanted. But after a harsh training regimen under Garp, Helmeppo gained great physical prowess. He was able to jump very high while intercepting Zoro. After the two year timeskip, he became powerful enough to become a lieutenant commander, and overpower an entire pirate crew by himself with great ease. Helmeppo is considerably skilled in swordsmanship. He was able to force Zoro on the defensive for a few seconds before ultimately losing. After the timeskip, his swordsmanship has greatly increased, able to cause considerable damage to a pirate submarine while underwater. He is also able to hit a cannonball flying overhead at a great speed, although he ended up caught in the resulting explosion. As a civilian, Helmeppo showed some interest in collecting weapons (including Zoro's Meito), but no desire or ability to use any of them apart from a single pistol. As a full-fledged Marine, Helmeppo's weapons of choice are a pair of kukri, which he keeps at the back of his waist on his belt. He was seen using them against Zoro when they met again in Water 7. However, he was still no match for Zoro. After the timeskip, Helmeppo wields a larger pair of kukri. After the timeskip, he is seemingly capable of using Soru like Koby. Helmeppo has implied that he is able to use Kenbunshoku Haki. He commented on how impressive Koby's Haki was compared to his own, in that Koby was able to sense an underwater attack on the ships of the Prodence and Dressrosa Kingdoms when he could not."},

{"name": "Hannyabal", "episode": "Episode 525", "chapter": "Chapter 422", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Hannyabal is a large pot-bellied man that resembles a cross between a devil and an Egyptian pharaoh. His brow ridge is shaped like horns, his chin is shaped like a pharaoh's false beard, and he wears a nemes with yellow and green stripes, the striped head cloth worn by pharaohs, with his hair coming from inside the nemes. His face in particular is designed in such a way that it looks like a Hannya mask. He wears demon-like wings on his back and also carries a pitchfork around, another common symbol linked to the devil. 22 years ago, when Shiki escaped the prison, Hannyabal was seen wearing the standard militaristic white uniform that normal guards wear. He still wore the nemes and the bat-like wings, but he also wore a cap over the former. Now, he goes bare-chested in reference to his great endurance. After his original nemes had been stolen by Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, his new one has a fox figurehead attachment on top that resembles the Egyptian jackal God of Death Anubis and has blue stripes instead of the green stripes. Overall, his appearance is an allegory to the underworld. After the timeskip, he now wears an outfit similar to Magellan, but without the horns that Magellan wears. He also appears to have gained a significant amount of weight. As child Hannyabal was rather chubby. He wore nothing but a leaf-skirt and a pair of black sandals. He is depicted as a fire-dancer.", "personality": "He has a habit of saying he owns everything and then having to apologize afterwards for getting ahead of himself. He does this because he is an ambitious person. He also seems to be prone to \"Freudian Slips\", which often give insight to his previously mentioned, ambitious qualities and his somewhat dark brand of humor. Hannyabal usually tries to show off how tough he really is to the prisoners by going into the Freezing Hell of Level 5 without weapons and almost completely naked, a reason he is admired amongst the guards. He is emotionally more stern than most characters and can maintain a clear mind even in the presence of Boa Hancock, remaining unaffected by her charms. Despite this, he seems to be easily infatuated with beautiful women, as he let slip of his true ambitions towards Hancock. This might have been because \"she wasn't his kind of woman\" as later he was easily seduced by Nami (who was really Bentham in disguise) and by Olive in the anime. Hannyabal's desire to become Warden by eliminating Magellan causes him to willingly jeopardize the security of Impel Down, such as letting prisoners run away, if it means for a chance to pin the blame on his superior. In short, Hannyabal cares more about his own position than the security and welfare of the prison, however he seems only willing to let prisoners escape if they are relatively harmless (ex. Buggy and Mr. 3) and shows genuine concern when powerful prisoners escape, like Crocodile and Jinbe. Despite his seemingly lack of seriousness most of the time, due to his desire to get Magellan fired, Hannyabal may get serious when the situation gets to the extreme, especially if he risks getting fired too. When this sudden change occurs, it can surprise even people who know him. Even though his ambition gets the better of him most of the time, those selfish aspects of his disappear completely when he feels the safety of civilians are on the line, such as dangerous prisoners escaping. It turns out that he is a considerate person who became a jailer to protect the lives of innocents by keeping criminals in prison. Furthermore, he was the only high-ranking jailer who was never shown torturing the inmates or to enjoy doing so. This other side of his personality is the reason he became a jailer in the first place, and the level of willpower he displays in this mindset is reminiscent to Luffy himself. Even when completely overwhelmed and near the brink of death, he will force himself to stay conscious and keep dangerous prisoners from escaping even when he barely has any strength left. Almost paralleling Luffy in many of his fights, he will grab onto his opponent limbs while on the ground and nearly beaten, to just barely hold them back before getting up and continuing to fight. His ideology towards pirates capable of great destruction like Luffy, Jinbe, or Crocodile is very different from most marines who believe in Absolute Justice. To him, he doesn't damn pirates and revolutionaries as evil or enemies of the World Government. He damns them because most committed grand crimes, and regardless of what those crimes were, they have enough power to create great alarm to the normal citizens of this world. He loathes the glorification of piracy, as those reputations were all created by breaking the law and becoming criminals, including Ace and Luffy. And thus, if powerful criminals are able to escape, the citizens of the world would fall into panic knowing dangerous criminals remained unchecked in the world and can even escape from Impel Down. He is willing to lay down his life even in a losing battle for this belief.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the current warden of Impel Down, Hannyabal has full control over Impel Down. Unlike Magellan or the Four Jailer Beasts, Hannyabal seems to lack a feared reputation for the prisoners to acknowledge, as Buggy and Mr. 3 stated that they had not heard anything about him. However, this was misleading, as he is one of the most powerful enforcers in Impel Down, being more powerful than any of the four Jailer Beasts and second only to Magellan himself. A possible explanation is that he will not fight unless it is an extreme emergency, such as a prisoner from Level 5 or Level 6 trying to escape. If not, he will not move a finger and leave the job to the Jailer Beasts or Magellan. He easily defeated both Buggy and Mr. 3 without a single scratch on him, even after taking a direct hit from Buggy's Muggy Ball (which was enough to severely harm the Jailer Beast Minotaurus and annihilate the entire platoon of jailers guarding the door to Level 3 ). On the other hand, the guards seem to know him to be a powerful fighter and enforcer. Magellan himself claimed that Hannyabal is the only person worthy to be his successor as Chief Warden of Impel Down, and this is later proven when after the two year time-skip Hannyabal was shown to have indeed succeeded Magellan as Chief Warden. Hannyabal also seems to have a resistance to extreme temperatures, as he is known to walk through the Freezing Hell with nothing more than his loincloth and nemes, as well as tolerating the extreme heat in Level 4 in the very same attire. He is also very resilient to physical strikes, and is capable of withstanding some of Luffy's Gear Second attacks and get back up on his feet. Weapon-wise, Hannyabal was seen wielding a pitchfork, like many of his subordinates, but has not been seen using that in battle (except in the anime). Instead, his signature weapon is a polearm based on a double-bladed naginata (a Japanese halberd) called \"Kessui\", which he is quite skilled in wielding. With a katana on each side, he is capable of performing a variety of attacks with it, and, most surprisingly, is also able to spin it wildly and create flames to deter any opponent. The fact that he is capable of using with such skill a weapon with two blades, which could potentially injure an inexperienced user, as well as the enemy, is a testament to his swordsmanship."},

When meeting the Straw Hat Pirates, he gave them the ultimatum to either enlist under the banner of the New Fish-Man Pirates or die. Even in his arrogance, though, he is surprisingly thoughtful, as he carefully thought out the Straw Hats' list of offenses and appeasements to the Fish-Men, and was considerate enough to view pirates as enemies of humanity (despite most of them being humans themselves) that he gives them the choice of siding with them or being destroyed.

However, Hajrudin is also a very honorable and prideful person, as befitting a warrior of Elbaf. He held Usopp in the air so everyone could see the man who saved him and the others, and proclaimed he would follow Usopp out of gratitude. In addition, upon meeting Luffy outside the Colosseum, he told him that he would put aside his defeat and kill Doflamingo to repay his debt to him. He would later decide to pledge his loyalty to Luffy and become a part of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet for the same reasons. He even cut all ties to Buggy's Delivery and quit his job as a pirate mercenary, leaving in order to honor his new allegiance to Luffy and the Straw Hats. His honor and pride as a warrior is great, as despite his many injuries during his battle against Machvise, he was determined to repay his debt to his saviors, and continued his battle against Machvise, sustaining even more serious injuries in order to finally defeat him. His honor and pride also seems to extend to his race as well, as he wants to plan and lead the revival of the currently disbanded Giant Warrior Pirates, an infamous crew that had been disbanded for a hundred years, and has already succeeded in recruiting four giants in pursuit of achieving this goal.

It seems to be someone very famous since a marine upon recognizing him asked for reinforcements and formerly an S Class member in Buggy's Pirate Dispatch Society, where Buggy himself recognized him as one of his best men in the organization. According to Gatz, he has been considered the strongest mercenary pirate. He was also able to face Machvise, an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, and after much effort he was able to defeat him. As a giant from Elbaf, he has incredible strength for his race. Although since he is the captain of a crew of giants, his strength must be above that of an ordinary giant. His punches were described as bolts of thunder, allowing him to overpower several powerful gladiators and crush Ucy. He has immense pain tolerance, able to withstand tremendous physical strain that nearly cost him an arm as well as taking the breaking of his right leg from the brutal force of Machvise's 10,000 Ton attack head on through sheer will and even managed to muster enough physical power to counter and overpower Machvise's attack, sending the officer flying straight into Doflamingo's Birdcage, incapacitating the former in the process. Hajrudin wears giant gauntlets, which he uses to hammer his fists down onto his enemies. He also wields a huge spiked club and seems to be quite proficient at using it, swatting a group of bounty hunters aside. When he was younger, he wielded a large broadsword.

Gyro stated that Hody Jones is not the first Fish-Man who he fought against, and that he overcame many dangers of Paradise, something proven by his presence on Fish-Man Island, which indicates some level of competence and experience. He carries a sword with a clover-shaped handguard charged to the right side of his waist and with his bounty, he is presumed to be skilled in swordsmanship.

He wears green plaid suspenders with dark stripes, a grey cape with a flower buckle, and a viking helmet, and lacks a shirt. He also wears a belt across his chest. He holds a blue and yellow striped shield, with eyes and a mouth with a very large tongue. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. As a newborn, he had shorter light brown hair and was wrapped in a yellow cloth in the anime.

He sports a fur-lined cape with the Marine insignia on it and epaulets over what looks like a long coat with pockets on it. On his back he carries a standard flintlock rifle.", "personality": "Despite his rather animal-like appearance, Gorilla seems to be a calm man, willing to carry out his orders as he is told. He is also logical as he refused to immediately jump to the conclusions about Franky during his stay on Karakuri Island. Furthermore, he is somewhat lacking in bravery as he was easily scared when he saw the \"Sacred Burning Beast\" running towards him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Having been sent to Karakuri Island to investigate the incident caused by Franky, it might be assumed that he has some investigation skills. This theory seems to be strengthened by the fact that he refused to immediately jump to the most obvious conclusions after his men reported to him, as he was willing to explore the island and learn more about the facts.

{"name": "Gol D. Roger", "episode": "Episode 1", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "His real name was revealed by Kureha in Chapter 154.", "appearance": "Roger was a tall and very muscular man. His most prominent physical features were his curved black mustache, a fierce grin he almost always wore, and his intense eyes. He also had thick black hair and a short, thick neck. Like many other high-ranking pirates, he wore a long red captain's coat. Beneath his coat, he wore a blue shirt and had a yellow sash around his waist. He wore a white cravat around his neck, dark blue pants, and what appeared to be black sea boots. Before he turned himself in, he also wore a pirate hat with his Jolly Roger on it over a yellow-spotted bandana. During the Edd War, however, he donned a dark-blue vest and a yellow sash. Thirty years ago, he was seen wearing a necklace. Later on, during a flashback to Roger's first meeting with Rayleigh, it was revealed that Roger wore the straw hat that Monkey D. Luffy is currently wearing. Ironically, Roger's looks in his youth were strikingly similar to Luffy's and as he grew older he began to resemble his future son, Ace.", "personality": "Roger was said to be fearless, and those who witnessed his execution even claim that he smiled just before his death, and during all of his flashback appearances, Roger was seen with a confident smile. His personality is often noted by people who knew him to have been similar to that of Monkey D. Luffy. This is best shown when he meets Rayleigh and asks him to join him, despite having no idea how strong he was or even what role he would have on his ship. Portgas D. Ace revealed his lineage to Whitebeard, who noted that Ace's personality was not much like his father's. However, they both shared a refusal to run from battle. Monkey D. Garp stated that Roger would not run away from an enemy in order to protect his crew from danger. They both also shared the common traits associated with the Will of D. Roger was also a man who loved big, flashy things and reveled in his title of Pirate King despite his oncoming death. While not portrayed during any of his appearances, he could be a merciless enemy when he got angry. This was further evidenced when he killed all of Squard's crew members personally for unknown reasons. Roger was very quick to anger, and he would retaliate for something as simple as an insult to his crew, regardless of how small it might be. Garp stated that an angry Roger could be a violent, selfish, and short-tempered man, but his actions had been pure and straight, just like a child's, and that he was lucky to survive and become the Pirate King despite his extremely reckless nature. He also had a side to him that mocked his enemies. After defeating a group of Marines, he told them to bring Garp or Sengoku while telling the Marines he just defeated that they were not worth his time. He did get excited when he got the opportunity to face strong enemies, charging straight ahead past Rayleigh and Scopper Gaban to face Kozuki Oden himself. When he clashed with Whitebeard for the first time in a while, he reacted with glee and casually greeted his old rival. Despite his prideful and aggressive nature, Roger was a considerably humble man as he bowed to Whitebeard and Oden when requesting the samurai to join his crew and offered all the treasure and supplies his crew obtained to Whitebeard in exchange for Oden's service. He was also more than happy to tell others of his dreams and would socialize with his rivals with great enthusiasm. In addition, he was considerate towards civilians, and forbade his crew from stealing from them. He also had a soft spot for children, as he was seen happily cradling Kozuki Hiyori when she was a baby. He was even gentle towards children of other races such as with the mermaid Shyarly when he innocently asked her for some predictions with a gentle smile, and with the mink Pedro when Roger encouraged him to wait for his own moment one day. He also believed a newborn child should not be responsible for the sins of their parents, as he asked Garp to protect his unborn child because he did not want his child to be killed for being related to him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Roger was hailed as one of the strongest pirates of all time, if not the strongest, considered nearly unstoppable in battle. As the Pirate King, he retains the highest status among all the world's pirates, even post-mortem. Elucidating this is the truly enormous bounty he had prior to his death, with 5,564,800,000 being the highest in pirating history. In addition, unlike the majority of the most powerful individuals in the world, Roger never had any Devil Fruit powers, which makes him even more impressive. Very few people are known to have ever matched Roger in battle: most prominently the legendary \"Hero of the Marines\" Monkey D. Garp, said to have cornered Roger multiple times before his surrender. According to Roger himself, he also considered Sengoku, the then future Fleet Admiral who wielded the power of a golden Buddha Mythical Zoan, as one of the two Marines that were worth his time. Aside from his animosity with the Marines, Roger's second foremost pirate rival was Whitebeard, who wielded the strongest Paramecia-type Devil Fruit and was renowned as the \"Strongest Man in the World\", even before Roger's death. Another person known to rival Roger was Rocks D. Xebec, who was considered to be his first and most formidable rival, even more so than his former subordinate Whitebeard would come to be, as it took the combined efforts of both Roger and Garp to finally defeat Rocks. Other examples of Roger's strength include fighting on equal ground with Shiki, who commanded the largest pirate fleet of his time, and single-handedly defeating the armies of several countries. and he also fought against Chinjao in the past many times. Kaidou, who at some point came to be called the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Roger in the same elite class with a very small number of other notable figures that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Whitebeard, Kozuki Oden, Shanks, and his former captain Xebec. Even a mighty warrior such as Oden, who had effortlessly slain actual gigantic beasts, commented on Roger's prowess, comparing his presence to that of a wild beast's. According to Rayleigh, Roger could locate the Poneglyphs because he had the ability to \"hear the voice of all things\". However, he was not like the Ohara scholars who used their intellect to study the Poneglyphs, so he could not exactly \"read\" them. Roger was also one of only five known beings who possessed the ability to hear Sea Kings speaking, the other four being Luffy, Shirahoshi, Poseidon, and Oden. He was also one of four known humans in the series who possessed the ability to hear Zunesha speaking, the other three being Luffy, Kozuki Oden, and Kozuki Momonosuke. Roger possessed immense physical strength, as shown when he easily sent Kozuki Oden flying. He could also clash evenly with a young Edward Newgate, who could, even in his old age, effortlessly overpower giants. Roger also had immense levels of endurance and vitality, even when his body was ravaged by an incurable disease. Aided by Crocus' medical skills, he managed to conquer the Grand Line in a mere three years. He was even able to fight for three days and three nights against Whitebeard until the fight resulted in a draw. Roger was an extremely skilled swordsman, overpowering the legendary master samurai Kozuki Oden with only one strike. He was also able to clash equally against Whitebeard's Murakumogiri, creating a powerful shockwave that blew back everything on the island as well as the Moby Dick by the coast. Roger was one of the very few people in the world who could use all three types of Haki. Kaidou mentioned that despite him not having a Devil Fruit, his Haki alone was powerful enough to make him among the strongest people in the world. Roger possessed immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki, which was seen when he clashed with fellow Haoshoku Haki user Edward Newgate. Their clash created a notable effect similar to lightning and released a large burst that traveled across the island that they were on and pushed back the Moby Dick alongside the nearby trees, clouds, and people. Most notably, Roger was one of the very few Haoshoku users able to use the advanced application to \"infuse\" his attacks with Haoshoku Haki to exponentially increase his attack power, with his sword being shown emitting streams of black lightning-like energy in his clash with Edward Newgate, signifying the infusion. Roger was an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. He could imbue his saber with Haki, allowing it to evenly clash against the Haki-infused Murakumogiri, one of the 12 Supreme Grade Meito. As a testament to his mastery, he overpowered Kozuki Oden, who was an exceptional master of Busoshoku Haki in his own right, with only a single brief attack. Furthermore, Roger could utilize the advanced application of emitting Busoshoku Haki out from his blade, allowing him to attack opponents without making physical contact. He was first shown using this during his battle against Whitebeard. In the anime, when Roger uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a red-colored flowing aura. Roger possessed the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Roger's main weapon was a cutlass named Ace, which is one of the 12 Supreme Grade Blades. He wielded it at least as far back as the God Valley Incident, and was shown possessing it up until the end of his pirating journey. During the Battle of Edd War, Roger was shown wielding a flintlock pistol with his right hand and Ace with his left."},

He has a pair of horns on his head that initially point to the sides, but then curve back toward each other before eventually pointing straight up. He has an extremely long and wild mane of red hair that almost reaches to the ground.

On the left side of his abdomen, he has a tattoo of Daiji , which means five.", "personality": "Like many of his fellow Numbers, Goki is a rowdy drunk and was considerably intoxicated when fighting broke out on Onigashima.

Due to his immense frame, attempts by human samurai to strike him in the ankles with normal-sized swords had no effect. However, he was defeated with one punch by Monkey D. Luffy in his Gear 4 form. Goki wielded a massive kanabo resembling Kaidou's, which was large enough to threaten an entire crowd of samurai with a single swing. However, it was cut in two by Roronoa Zoro."},

Namely that the alternate casual top of the Kuja, which appears to be evening wear, that she wears is blue instead of the pink-bordered burgundy seen in the anime. Additionally, her Snake Weapon is colored purple, as opposed to the white color seen in the \"Share the World\" opening. It acts as her staff and the upper body of the snake is curled up. She is remarkably diminutive in height, with very thick lips, and is wrinkled from old age. She also wears some kind of sea-green bubble belt apparently meant to hold up the spotted-print short skirt that all Kuja wear. Also like most Kuja, she wears a cape. Her hair is white and she wears a pink flower on the left side of her head.", "personality": "Gloriosa seems to be designed around the concept of a wise old woman, as made apparent by her concerns for Amazon Lily itself and expressing knowledge that her fellow Kuja had no idea of. She also asks the Kuja pirates for books, and has a crystal ball, both things that would further this image. However, since she believed some of Hancock's lies about considering the World Governments' terms for war, this proved that she was still gullible towards people's intent. Although she is not immune to many of Hancock's emotional manipulations designed to make people follow her, Gloriosa can snap out of them much faster than many others, male or female. Although she is no longer the Empress of Amazon Lily, she believes that she can still go anywhere (which Hancock proved otherwise), but chooses to live on the outskirts of the island because she's apparently considered to be a traitor. Though, during their conversation about the upcoming war, when Hancock accuses her of worrying about her own life, she simply states that she's already too old to be concerned about her own life, but expresses concern for the sake of others on the island. Gloriosa does not seem to the share the misandrist tendencies of her fellow Kuja, possible due to her past experiences with men. However, she still strictly abides by the Kuja laws of men not being allowed into Amazon Lily, with her only allowing few exceptions. She also says \"Nyo\" a lot, going as far as to incorporate it into a number of words whenever she talks.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gloriosa has more knowledge than most of her fellow Kuja, such as what a man is as she did identify Luffy as a man upon seeing him. She is also able to throw off Hancock's charms faster than most men and women, showing a particularly strong willpower. Also, being a former Empress of the Kuja Tribe, Gloriosa was undoubtedly a powerful Kuja in her prime and, despite her advanced age, she was still able to not only survive being thrown out of a building, but also land on her feet unharmed. In the anime, in spite of being elderly, Gloriosa has shown to be extremely agile. When Luffy started running off, Gloriosa easily caught up with Luffy, kicking him with great force as Luffy stated. As the former Empress of the Kuja, she can use Haki."},
{"name": "Gladius", "episode": "Episode 682", "chapter": "Chapter 608", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 723.", "appearance": "Gladius wears a long black coat with gold metal rings on the arms and chest, gold rivets studded around the collar and shoulders, and black and gold metal gears on the elbows, along with matching black boots. He also sports a similarly-studded white mask that covers the lower half of his face, matching (black in the manga, white in anime pants with gold yellow zippers on either side of him) a pair of blue goggles, and a black top hat, altogether giving him a style very reminiscent of steampunk. His spiky, light blue hair is usually stuffed inside his hat and flares out when uncovered, often at the hat's expense. As Gladius begins to lose his temper, his hair will puff up to the point of piercing through a hat, or he detonates his headgear. When he ruptured his top hat, he switched to a more durable motorcycle helmet, only to blow it up so he could weaponize its shrapnel. He has a scar across the right temple which seems to reach to his goggles. In the anime, his elbows seem to be completely mechanical. After using his Fashion Punc technique, his hairstyle became a buzz cut. As a child, he wore a black coat with various trinkets on it, and wore a surgical face mask on his mouth and his goggles on his forehead. He also wielded a gladius, fitting his name. At age 17, his hair was shorter and he wore a shorter coat, leaving it open. At age 23, his hair was longer and spikier, and he wore a different coat, now zipped all the way up.", "personality": "Gladius is especially known for his short temper, and his Devil Fruit powers are known to flare up whenever he gets easily enraged. Like most of Doflamingo's underlings, he treats his \"young master\" with utmost loyalty and got angry when he noticed Violet's betrayal. He did not hesitate to shoot Baby 5 while she was assaulting Doflamingo, although he did so very casually, perhaps because he was simply annoyed by the ruckus she was causing. His ruthlessness also extends to his underlings, as he showed no concern to any of them during his fight with Cavendish and Bartolomeo and let many of them get injured by his attacks. He values punctuality and precision in following and executing orders, and he despises those who do not live up to his standards. He seems to have a low tolerance for morbid discussions, as he nearly vomited when Law spoke of hiding within a mountain of corpses during dinner. Despite, or maybe because of, the loyalty he has to his \"young master\", he seemed to be unable to distinguish him from Kin'emon in disguise.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the officers of the Donquixote Pirates, Gladius held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He possesses great durability, as shown when he was struck by one of Luffy's Gear 2 attacks, only to shrug it off and quickly recover with no visible signs of harm and no permanent injuries whatsoever. He also appears to be very agile, easily capturing Kabu, Rampo, and Thunder Soldier, all of whom are known for their high speed. He was able to hold his own in a fight against both Cavendish and Bartolomeo, each of whom has a bounty of over 100 million, although he did end up being defeated. Gladius ate the Pamu Pamu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to make his own body expand and rupture, he can also make any inorganic object he touches swell up and rupture. The rupturing is like a strong explosion. When he ruptures objects, they are destroyed, but rupturing his own body leaves him unharmed. He can expand and rupture his limbs at the moment his physical attacks connect, allowing him to augment his blows with explosive force. He can also make his entire body swell up, effectively making himself into a gigantic bomb that is capable of causing massive damage. By using his power on objects, he can make them explode like grenades, this results in pieces of the ruptured object flying in all directions and acting like shrapnel. He can also expand and rupture the ground itself, causing massive devastation to the surrounding area and sending his opponents flying. He needs to be touching his target until it actually ruptures, if he lets go, then the swelling will go down. His power cannot by used to expand and rupture living things other than himself. Notably however, if a living thing has been transformed into an object, such as people being turned into Toys by the power of the Hobi Hobi no Mi, then they are considered inorganic objects, as far as Gladius' power is concerned at least. Thus, he is able to use his power to make them swell and rupture. Gladius has been seen using a pistol to shoot Baby 5. He is known for his skills in artillery, as he taught Law how to use firearms. His arms appear to be equipped with a firing mechanism which he uses in conjunction with his Devil Fruit ability to shoot rupturing bullets. It also seems that his goggles give him telescope-like vision, similar to Usopp's goggles, which increases his accuracy. Additionally, his hair is coated in a paralyzing agent, which becomes a dangerous projectile when combined with his Devil Fruit powers."},

She is very passionate about art and her ability to bring her visions to life. However, her passion for the arts seems to somewhat cloud her judgment, as Brook was able to fool her into undoing the transformation on his violin and sword-cane by telling her that he also was an artist and that he wanted to play music in tandem with her art. She is also very cruel when she wishes to be, as shown when she violently yelled and later slapped Mansherry repeatedly to force her powers out all the while smiling at her situation. At age 45, around when Law joined the Donquixote Pirates crew, Giolla was seen acting as a mother-like figure for younger members of the crew, such as baby Dellinger and little Baby 5 and Buffalo.

She also managed to recover quickly after being defeated by Brook's signature technique, and again after incurring a series of beatings from Nami, Brook, Chopper, and Momonosuke, that was meant to prevent her from attacking them in the future. She remained fairly unaffected after Leo assaulted her with the body of her fallen comrades, that she collected from the battlefield herself. Giolla ate the Ato Ato no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to alter the shape and appearance of any object, including living organisms, into whatever she wishes, making it into distorted, abstract art.

His eyes are surrounded by dark rings, possibly stemming from the terror and exhaustion he experienced during and after the Krieg Pirates' disastrous voyage into the Grand Line.[citation needed] His clothes consist of an open gray-white jacket lined with twin red sea-serpent designs, a green undershirt, gray trousers, a gray headband with blue stripes, and two round earrings on each ear. While posing as Don Krieg, he overlaid these with a large dark coat to mimic Krieg's cape.[citation needed]", "personality": "Gin is fiercely loyal to Don Krieg, carrying out whatever orders he may be given from him no matter how inhumanely brutal or ruthless without protest or hesitation, thus earning himself the epithet of \"Gin the Man-Demon\". His respect for Krieg is so great that he obeys Krieg's orders to throw away his gas mask and breathe the deadly MH5 poison gas because he is ashamed to have failed him. However, unlike Krieg, Gin has a sense of honor, being unable to bring himself to kill Sanji, the first person to show him kindness (by saving him from starvation).", "abilities_and_powers": "Gin is a skilled warrior and a match for even an experienced martial artist like Sanji (although Sanji was severely injured during their fight due to the beating he received from Pearl). The Baratie cooks' first impression of him was due to him being starved and weakened; they believed him to be a mere lower-ranking subordinate, until he revealed his true strength later in battle, which led to the surprise of many. Having earned a bounty of 12,000,000 is considered impressive for an East Blue pirate. Gin was captured by Marines upon his first appearance, but after being starved to near death and held in a prison cell on Fullbody's ship for 3 days, he was still able to escape and take down 7 of Fullbody's men. He was also able to pin down Red Leg Zeff, a retired yet still powerful former pirate, and broke his peg leg. Gin's primary fighting style, known as Man-Demon Tactics, utilizes a special pair of tonfa weighted with metal spheres. These can be used as direct bludgeons, or spun in place like flails for extra momentum and power; combined with Gin's natural strength and agility, they become highly deadly weapons capable of smashing Pearl's iron shields in a single blow (a feat even Sanji could not achieve with multiple blows). Gin has been seen carrying two different firearms: a single-barreled pistol that he used to shoot Lines from behind, and a double-barreled, shotgun-esque pistol that he used to take Zeff hostage.

However, he can be quick to anger as shown when he attacked Apoo at point blank range for calling him and Maha the World Nobles' dogs, and was even willing to eliminate Drake, an undercover agent of SWORD whom he considers to be an inconvenience.

They also faced two members of the Worst Generation, Apoo and X Drake, alongside Zanki and Inbi (two of the Numbers). Here he defeated X Drake with apparent ease, which caused Apoo and Inbi to decide to abandon the fight upon seeing the strength of the two agents. Guernica displayed a great degree of stamina and endurance, showing few signs of exhaustion after multiple battles. He dove through Kazenbo and emerged unscathed, despite being engulfed in flames in the process. Apoo's sound-based explosion, which was powerful enough to temporarily knock Luffy unconscious, had little effect on him. Even getting stabbed through the back with a sword by X Drake did not stop him from reaching the top of Onigashima to interfere in Luffy and Kaidou's battle. Guernica is very fast, having been able to reach the top of Onigashima in a short period of time. Furthermore, he was able to latch onto Luffy before he could unleash his attack against Kaidou and get away from the latter just before he can land his attack on Luffy. As an agent of CP0, the elite Cipher Pol agency, Guernica is a master assassin and user of Rokushiki. He was shown to have access to Soru, Shigan, and Tekkai.

After the Arlong Pirates invaded Cocoyasi Village, his face and body were heavily scarred by an attack from Kuroobi. Some time after the Summit War of Marineford, he began to grow a bit of stubble on his chin.", "personality": "As Bell-mre was growing up, she was known as the village trouble maker (he refers to her as you little thug). Her reputation caused him to express concerns over the children's well-being when she announced she was adopting them as her daughters. He has had close ties with both Nami and Nojiko since they were kids because of his concern over their adoptive mother's capabilities and spent most of his time watching out for them. Eventually this grew into a desire just to see all three of them live together and grow together as a happy family. After their mother's death, he became concerned for the happiness of Nami and Nojiko, as he had grown into a father figure to them. He and the other villagers realized Nami would never join up with Arlong's crew without good reason. His concern for her and Nojiko's well being also led him to promise Luffy that he would hunt him down and kill him if he ever took away Nami's smile. He kept the town together after Arlong took over the island, making sure everyone was safe and able to pay Arlong's tax. Whenever there was trouble between the villagers and Arlong or his crew, he took full responsibility for everything so the villagers would not be punished. He helped keep the village together to give Nami the time to complete her plan to save the village. When her 8 years of hard work to save them fell apart after Arlong's betrayal, he decided enough was enough. If they were going to die, they would die trying to fight Arlong even with Nami pleading that she can just start all over again. Genzo also has a perverted side, as he becomes quite flustered when Bell-mre offered to pay back the items the latter stole \"with her body\" but when Nami parroted Belle-mere's words, Genzo just yelled at the girl not to pick up her adoptive mother's bad habits. Genzo has a blown-up image of Nami's wanted poster, in which she appears in a bikini, despite stating that she shouldn't have posed like that as it would draw the attention of more perverts (Marriage seekers in the English version) than bounty hunters. Genzo was also horrified to see Nami's brazen new dress sense in the papers and imagined faceless leering pirates around her.", "abilities_and_powers": "Nothing more than an ordinary fighter, Genzo lacks any great strength and was easily defeated by Arlong and his crew when he tried to save Bell-mre and her children.

He is not without flaws, however, because he has a tendency to overestimate his own abilities and underestimate the capabilities of his opponents. Gem ate the Bomu Bomu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create strong explosions from any part of his body, or even his entire body, without harming himself, as well as rendering him immune to all manner of explosions and explosion-based attacks. He can also bestow explosive properties to his bodily secretions, such as the snot from his nose. According to Mr. 3, he happens to make poor use of his fruit. It should be noted though, that Mr. 3 is antagonistic to others within Baroque Works like this. Gem uses a new model of pistol from South Blue, the Flintlock .44 Caliber 6 Shot Revolver, which has rapid-fire capabilities. This pistol is used for his Breeze Breath Bomb, in which he breathes into the flintlock's chambers, and then empties all six rounds at his opponents quickly. He preferred to use this weapon only for tougher situations. Since his breath is explosive thanks to his Bomu Bomu no Mi, the six invisible air bullets accumulate much more damage than that of normal ones. Gem tends to empty all six rounds per attack, causing massive damage on one target, and then swiftly refill. Gem seems to be a competent sniper with this pistol, as he accurately shot Usopp with all six bombing air bullets from a fair distance."},

During Gol D. Roger's execution twenty-two years before Monkey D. Luffy set out on his adventure, Moria looked much thinner, had a pointed chin, and a little longer hair. He also did not have any cross stitches from below his lip, though he did possess them on his forehead. His appearance was similar when he challenged Kaidou in Wano a year later. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Moria had shorter horns and hair and was missing the cross stitches running down the middle of his face. He wore a baggy, long-sleeved white shirt with suspenders and dark, knee-high pants. He also wore his usual long black gloves with cowboy boots with spurs and a jewel-encrusted dagger on his belt. He was also much thinner and had a chin and longer legs.", "personality": "Moria has a relaxed, laid-back, and even lazy personality, seemingly appearing to believe he cannot lose. He also believes that a true pirate should fear nothing, not even death. Similar to fellow Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo, in most situations Moria is constantly grinning maniacally, and only seems to change expression when something bad happens to him or when he believes his power is being ridiculed. Like many others, Moria has a distinct style of laughing: \"Kishishishi\". In general, he prefers to avoid fighting altogether, or at least fighting his enemy directly, either making his shadow fight or ordering one of his subordinates to do so. His proclivity to delegate tasks to his minions is also a weakness in and of itself, along with making exceptions to act out himself should his personal pride or power be questioned; Jinbe noted that Moria had grown weak from his lack of training. Moria desires to become the new Pirate King and believes that this is possible to achieve if he has powerful subordinates. Though he once claimed that he would rely on his own powers to achieve his goals, he is incredibly lazy; his motto is \"relying upon others for one's own objective\" (, tarikihongan?) and his favorite phrase is \"You do it!!\" (, Omae ga yare?). This also extends to his fighting style, as he prefers to lay back and let his shadow battle with the powers of the Kage Kage no Mi. He also appears to have considerable knowledge of the New World and how terrifying it is. At Thriller Bark, he told Luffy that with his current strength, he would lose his crew; his prediction came true before the Straw Hats went to the New World, at the Sabaody Archipelago. Moria has a lot of experience, having fought many opponents in the past, including an Emperor. He is a good battle tactician, being able to outsmart even Nico Robin. However, his overconfidence and laziness made him underestimate his opponents, and ultimately led to his defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates. In the past, Moria had the Gecko Pirates who he considered to be valuable comrades, and by his own admission was overconfident and headstrong. He also deeply cared for his crewmates, which was a point of tragedy when his last encounter with the Emperor known as Kaidou ended with Moria being the sole survivor of his crew. Shell-shocked and traumatized by the horrific event, Moria immediately departed from the New World, and decided that the only way he would not have to face such pain ever again would be to make his comrades unable to suffer by turning them into mindless zombies that serve only his desires. The loss of his crew to Kaidou changed Moria's outlook on life substantially, making him believe that subordinates are better off as zombies because, due to their undead status, they cannot be harmed by any physical damage - they can only be \"purified\" by the sea or elements of the sea and even if they were purified, he could easily find other shadows to reanimate them. In addition, creating a zombie powerful enough to defeat Kaidou became one of Moria's driving motivations. Despite his cruelty and twisted outlook on life, he is capable of showing true care towards those close to him. When Absalom was kidnapped by Blackbeard, Moria did not hesitate to go try to rescue him despite the risks of entering an Emperor's territory, especially given how the Blackbeard Pirates are hunting powerful Devil Fruits. He was also shown to be loving towards Perona when she was growing up, as Perona herself viewed Moria as a father figure, suggesting he is capable of displaying affection to others.", "abilities_and_powers": "Moria is a former Warlord of the Sea, as well as one of the most experienced pirates in the entire Grand Line. In his prime, he was referred to as being a \"rival\" to Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors (though eventually he lost his entire crew to the man). During the Summit War of Marineford, he was strong enough to battle Curiel, the 10th division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, while sustaining no injuries aside from a strike he suffered from Jinbe (a fellow former Warlord). He also managed to fell Little Oars Jr. in one move, though others had already injured the mighty giant beforehand. Unfortunately, his tendency to heavily rely on underlings (or his own shadow) to fight for him in the battlefield may have contributed to his diminished prowess in single combat; often, Moria would run away from or ignore an adversary if he deemed the battle as \"pointless\", as seen when he dismissed Luffy's challenge on Thriller Bark because he had already extracted the Straw Hat's shadow from him. Jinbe claimed that Moria's dependence on absorbing the shadows of other people had weakened him. After the Summit War of Marineford ended, Donquixote Doflamingo claimed that the government had deemed Moria to be far too weak to continue to bear the title of Warlord of the Sea and that he was better off eliminated; despite this, Mihawk recalls that Moria was perfectly fine at the end of the war, it still took Doflamingo and a group of Pacifistas to corner him, and Moria still managed to escape (though that was mostly thanks to Absalom). As further testament to his potential, Blackbeard, who is known for refusing to recruit weaklings into his crew, asked Moria to become his subordinate. Moria has a very strong will, which allowed him to sustain 1000 shadows within his body by using Shadow's Asgard, though it did exert him greatly. He was also completely unaffected by a burst of Luffy's Haoshoku Haki during the Summit War of Marineford. True to his large size and mass, Moria has great strength; he effortlessly lifted a grown man with a single hand while squeezing him hard to enough to make him cough up blood. In spite of his physique, however, Moria is incredibly fast: he outran Luffy, who is both much smaller and more accustomed to physical movement, for a considerable amount of time. Moria possesses considerable endurance, having gotten up immediately after attacks by Nightmare Luffy that toppled Oars and quickly recovered from a powerful strike from Jinbe to battle a commander of the Whitebeard Pirates. He is also fairly durable, as he did not take any damage when Nami's Thunderbolt Tempo struck Oars. Also, even though he was crushed under the main tower of Thriller Bark, only a small injury to his head remained after his recovery, as evidenced by his appearance at Marineford. Moria is smart and strategic, demonstrating keen planning on multiple occasions. He often plans ahead with his zombies, placing certain shadows in certain bodies and altering the bodies to suit whatever his purpose would be under the circumstances. He apparently knows of the mechanics behind Bartholomew Kuma's ability to transport people elsewhere instantly, something that most people are not even aware of. Moria ate the Kage Kage no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to manifest and control shadows as physical entities. Moria can manifest his own shadow and have it fight in his place, as well as split his shadow into a number of bat-like creatures that he can use to swarm his enemy. He can also instantaneously swap locations with his shadow. His shadow cannot be destroyed, and it will simply reform if it gets taken down. As a basic law for nature, the body and the shadow are always the same shape. Normally, the shadow is slave to the body, but Moria can put the reverse into practice. By altering the shape of a shadow, he can change the shape of the body. Moria can steal other people's shadows by cutting them off of the owner's body. People who have their shadow stolen are left in a coma for about two days. Furthermore, once someone's shadow has been stolen, sunlight becomes deadly to them, reducing them to ashes almost instantly if they are exposed to it. Victims of shadow theft also lose their reflection. If the person dies, then the shadow will die with them; even when separated, the body and the shadow count as a single being. When stolen shadows are released, they automatically fly back to their original owners. Moria can insert stolen shadows into his own body, causing him to become bigger and stronger. The more shadows he takes in, the more gigantic he becomes, though it also makes him uncoordinated. The stolen shadows can also be inserted into corpses, reanimating the corpse into a zombie loyal to Moria. When reanimating a zombie, the physical strength comes from the corpse itself, while the personality and fighting techniques come from the shadow and are identical to those of the shadow's original owner. Shadows can also be placed into the bodies of living people, increasing their physical power and granting them the ability to use the fighting techniques of the shadow's original owner. However, since a living body already has a soul residing inside it, a shadow placed within a living body will only remain for 10 minutes. After that, the shadow will leave and fly back to its owner. Moria wields a giant pair of scissors, which he uses in conjuncture with his Kage Kage no Mi to sever people's shadows. He carries these with him all the time so he can steal shadows even during battle, such as when he took Robin's shadow. The scissor blades can be disconnected at the joint, becoming two inverted swords for Moria. With shadows of capable swordsmen implanted into himself, Moria can become a swordsman with dual swords. He is also seen with a sword during his battle against the Beasts Pirates."},

His attire is that of a stereotypical pirate captain, with an epaulette longcoat and a bicorne hat bearing his Jolly Roger. During the Loguetown Arc, the anime depicted him with a markedly lanky build and gray hair (save for his black mustache), and added a large upward-curling goatee as well as a downward-curling tricorne. The latter two, when viewed together, gave his face an additional \"crescent\" motif. In Romance Dawn Story, he was depicted with orange-red hair (again save for his black mustache) and a similarly-curling goatee, though his hat was reverted to a conventional bicorne.

{"name": "Galdino", "episode": "Episode 117", "chapter": "Chapter 70", "year": 2000, "note": "His real name was revealed by an Impel Down Guards in Chapter 532.", "appearance": "When he first appeared, Galdino was an average-sized man with a rather frail-looking build. Like other male Baroque Works agents, Mr. 3 has his number hidden somewhere on his costume. For Mr. 3, he has 3's visible on his vest design, upper part of his glasses, and one big 3 achieved through his top knot. He also wears glasses and has neatly combed hair. He was also seen wearing a Log Pose on his left wrist. As a small form of comic relief, his hair seems to form various shapes according to the situation (like an \"!\" when he got scared or a \"?\" when he heard about Luffy for the first time and asked who Luffy was during the Little Garden arc, and even an arrow pointing to where he was talking about during the Impel Down Arc). Later, like most Impel Down prisoners, he wears a striped prisoner's outfit, with his top knot sagging and his right lens of his glasses cracked. His hair became untidy, and he grew a beard due to the roughness of the Beast Hell he was placed in. After the escape, he changed to a black pair of pants, and adorned a cloak over his attire. In an attempt to save Ace, Galdino disguised himself as an executioner, and somehow made himself look slightly more muscular. After the war he trimmed his hair back to its original length but kept his beard. He is also seen wearing a orange button collar shirt and brown pants. When Galdino uses his Candle Champion technique, he gains an incredible change in size.The suit is white; however, with Miss Goldenweek's painting abilities, the suit could be colored, as shown during the Little Garden Arc. After the time-skip, not much has changed about Galdino except that he has grown a full mustache. He also currently wears a white shirt with suspenders and a red bowtie.", "personality": "Galdino thinks very highly of himself, and is not afraid to show it. He believes himself to be a master of strategy, using his intellect and total lack of scruples to complete his plans.This statement is at least partly true, since Crocodile himself admitted that although Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were stronger than Galdino, he had been assigned a higher rank due to his intelligence. He also thinks of himself as a great artist, using his wax powers to turn his victims into \"living statues\" for his former partner, Miss Goldenweek,to paint over. However, when presented with situations in which he has to fight for his life, he reveals himself as little more than a coward who fears fighting (such as when a rage-filled Brogy was close to completely shattering his wax bonds). He is also somewhat sadistic, as he prefers killing people after making them perfect human sculptures in a long and painful process, rather than killing them directly. During his fights, he prefers to prevent opponents from attacking him by trapping their body parts with his Devil Fruit. Galdino also likes tea, especially Earl Grey. However, he apparently had some unexpected changes while in Impel Down. While he was a coward before, Galdino risked his life to repay a debt to Luffy by blocking a torrent of deadly poison. He also admits that if he is not careful, he could end up viewing Luffy as a friend. After Bentham sacrificed himself to save the escapees, he was clearly very upset and admitted that he did not think Bentham was really all that bad. This eventually results in Galdino attempting to free Ace on his own accord, stating that he wants to avenge his fallen comrade and fulfill Bentham's last wish, risking his life for a second time in doing so. Like many other characters, Galdino has a distinctspeech style. He tends to end his sentences in \"gane\", for example: \"omae mo-gane\" (you too gane) or \"warau-gane\" (laugh-gane). Like many catchphrases in the series, it has no actual meaning other than a distinct way of talking.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to the fall of Baroque Works, Mr. 3 was amongst the top-ranked members of the criminal organization, and presumably had a number of Billions (the lower ranked subordinates of Baroque Works Officer Agents) under his command. He is also highly artistic and detailed, capable of perfectly replicating the physical structure of a human being with just a visual in mind. Crocodile only allowed Mr. 3 to hold his position in the organization as \"Mr. 3\" because Mr. 4 was too mentally slow. Otherwise, he would have been ranked lower. In Impel Down, he proves his overall lack of fighting spirit on a number of occasions; this was further proven when he fainted under Luffy's burst of Haki, though he did wake up for some time after that on his own. He acted like a coward and backed up Buggy's escape plan rather than Luffy's much more dangerous advancement to the lower levels. After Magellan had shown up on the fleeing group during their escape, Galdino showed a moment of bravery, but he admitted he could only hold it together for a brief moment. In spite of his cowardice, Galdino seems to have some skill in stealth and infiltration. Galdino's tactical intellect is his greatest asset, opportunistic by nature,Galdino prefer to use cunning wits to outsmart and defeat enemies, this was shownwhen he manipulatedeverlasting battle between the giants Dorry and Brogy so as to obtain at least one 100,000,000 bounty without the need to engage in any physical combat. He is very observant with a strong sense of danger as he noticed something was amiss in Impel Down's Level 4, after he and Buggy accidentally ended up in Level 4 with Bentham and Luffy. He noticed the guards were moving in formations and that no one was feeding the fires nor were any of the prisoners trying to escape. As a result, he cautioned Buggy on following Bentham and Straw Hat to the Kitchen, fearing the possibility of a trap and told Buggy they had to check the exits, suspecting the possibility of Warden Magellan appearing to restore order to the prison and capture Luffy which is proven when Magellan personally appeared to stop Luffy. While working together, he and Buggy were able to bypass many of Impel Down's surveillance systems after abandoning Bentham in Level 5. This was further elaborated during the Marineford Arc, where he demonstrated being clever enoughto avoid Aokiji's freezing powers by substituting himself with one of his wax statues without the admiral noticing, and then later succeeding at impersonating one of Ace's executioners in his secret attempt to free the 2nd Division Commander. Galdino ate the Doru Doru no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create and control candle wax. He can manipulate this wax into any shape he desires, change it between solid and liquid states, and control its motion in both liquid and hardened states. The wax is noted to be stronger than steel while it is solid. Interestingly, as a \"Candle Man\", he produces flames from his hair while using his powers. He is able to craft various weapons, tools, and other constructs out of wax; he can attack his opponents with wax swords and spears, bind his opponents in globs of wax that he hardens on contact with the victim, and protect himself with wax walls and hide among a collection of wax clones. He can even create a wax mech suit for himself and form buildings out of wax that he and his allies can use as a home base/protective fortress. He can also use his wax to create keys that he can use to unlock cages and shackles. Galdino's wax is an excellent defense against poison and is resilient against digestive acid. Attributes that he used to overcome dangerous situations, such as protecting himself and the other prisoners in Impel Down from Magellans poison, and when Crocodile fed his to a giant gator. His wax can be quickly melted by high heat and fire. Mr. 3 owned a personal ship during his career in Baroque Works. He used this ship to arrive discreetly to Arabasta and to escape Mr. 2 Bon Kurei's vigilance. It's a small boat with 3 as a figurehead. It also has the Baroque Works Jolly Roger as the flag. Nefertari Vivi mentioned that it is powered by his Doru Doru no Mi powers, although the exact method has yet to be explained. It likely functions similarly to Smoker's Billower Bike in that his wax flows around an axle to rotate the paddles. It first appeared in Chapter 158 and Episode 93, and was later seen in the Baroque Works Mini-Series. What happened to it after Mr. 3 was arrested and sent to Impel Down is unknown, but it is unlikely that he is still using it, as he is now onboard Big Top."},

His hair is wavy and of a pale blond color. He wears a dark suit with a light dress shirt underneath, some jewelry around his neck and a sun-shaped brooch on the left side of his suit's collar. He also wears a fedora-like hat with its crown resembling a small, square-shaped golden castle. He is frequently seem smoking a cigar.", "personality": "Like many, Furrari admired the mermaid princess because of her beauty, and was aware that other kings like Jeep would attempt to court her with their children, trying to involve his own son in a marriage pitch as well. He can be easily offended as he got angry when Shirahoshi rejected her suitors. Furrari appears to be fairly argumentative and confrontational, as he and Ramen of Kano Country were shown bickering for an undisclosed reason.", "abilities_and_powers": "Furrari is the king of a nation affiliated with the World Government and one of the few allowed to attend the Levely, which grants him some authority over matters concerning the world. According to Monkey D. Garp's description of the Levely to Neptune, Furrari's nation appears to be relatively small and subservient to the whims of greater ones, like Chap's."},
{"name": "Funkfreed", "episode": "Episode 365", "chapter": "Chapter 254", "year": 2005, "note": "", "appearance": "Untransformed, Funkfreed appears as a large and intimidating cutlass-esque sword, typically slung over-the-shoulder by Spandam. Only a few vestiges of his animal formmost notably a pair of tusks set into the hilt, and a tail-shaped pommelare visible. Fully transformed, he appears as a gentle, friendly-looking elephant, about one or two heads taller than Spandam. Much of his upper body is covered by anelaborate leather harness vaguely resembling a jhul cloth (with headgear somewhat similar to Spandam's mask). His hide is an ordinary stone-gray (white in the anime). In his hybrid form, his head and upper torso (notably smaller than those of his full-beast form) extend from the hilt in a serpent-like manner, with the blade melding into his trunk.", "personality": "Funkfreed is a peaceable, devoted animal, effectively Spandam's closest (if not only) friend. As such, he tends to be physically affectionate in peacetime, and obedient during battle; however, he is not a particularly brave combatant, and will easily surrender if placed in direct danger.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a sword empowered by the Zou Zou no Mi, Funkfreed carries all the standard abilities of Zoan-type Devil Fruit, and can transform between an elephant-sword hybrid and a full elephant at Spandam's command. This grants him the size and strength of an elephant, the sharpness and durability of a steel blade, and a sentient mind able to strategize between the two; his hybrid form is particularly flexible, and well-trained enough to ram opponents in tight spaces without any fatal damage. However, given that Spandam has virtually no ability as a swordsman, most of Funkfreed's asset lies in catching others by surprise. His capacities for open battle amount to little, his temperament even less."},

His hair is pink and was well-combed and he had a scar under his right eye and bolts attached to his knuckles. Now he wears a Marine cap, a navy blue shirt, orange plaid pants, and brown boots. He still has his bolts attached to his knuckles. His hair is also a bit longer and more unkept.", "personality": "Fullbody was once a successful and arrogant Marine who loved entertaining women and considered himself to be a lady's man. After meeting Sanji and the Straw Hats at Baratie, Fullbody met and befriended Jango, former First Mate and Captain of the Black Cat Pirates. Despite following his duty and arresting Jango due his status as a pirate, Fullbody spoke up for his friend after Jango was sentenced to death by hanging and accepted a demotion to Seaman Recruit in exchange for Jango being pardoned for his crimes, allowing Jango to enlist in the Marines. In addition to his friendship with Jango, Fullbody took care for the safety of innocent civilians, demonstrating that he is a noble person at heart and appears to adhere to Moral Justice over Absolute Justice. However despite his noble traits, he appears to hold a grudge against Sanji as he wishes to defeat and capture him (and by extension his fellow Straw Hats), though this desire to arrest and defeat Sanji may also be due out of his sense of duty as a Marine (as Sanji is a pirate and the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates) in addition to his desire to take revenge on Sanji for his humiliating defeat at the Baratie.", "abilities_and_powers": "So far Fullbody has yet to display any particular abilities, but is an adept fighter, using a fighting style similar to boxing. He is a strong fighter, as seen when he easily defeated Johnny and Yosaku, but outclassed by most of the stronger fighters (e.g Sanji) seen in the series thus far in terms of overall power. He also knows how to dance very well. During the Whitebeard War, unlike Jango, he did not succumb to Luffy's Haki, indicating that of the two he has the stronger will. He had previously been an effective fighter in the Marines, but after he paired up with Jango, he became a more goofy fighter; while still skilled in combat their silliness has been noted by Hina to be annoying. Fullbody uses his knuckle dusters as weapons; they make his boxing punches more lethal."},

In his youth, he appeared to be a relatively scrawny man of average height. Shortly after landing on the Island of Rare Animals, most of his body was irreversibly compressed into a treasure chest, leaving only his head, hands, and feet free (and one of his teeth dislodged). Over the next twenty years, he grew a sizable beard and an even larger afro, giving him a curiously shrub-like appearance.", "personality": "As a young man, Gaimon was a stereotypically greedy pirate, caring about little more than plunder. This greed was slowly eroded (though never completely erased) by his decades of solitude on the Island of Rare Animals, causing him to prize peace and companionship more than any material wealth. In any case, Gaimon is highly protective of anything he deems treasure, and as a result tends to be hostile to any strangers he meets. However, once his trust has been earned, he can prove to be remarkably friendly and helpful, especially to fellow castaways.", "abilities_and_powers": "Gaimon demonstrated no combat abilities in his youth, but appeared to be an above-average climber. Notably, he was able to scale the Island of Rare Animals' steepest cliff barehanded (a feat that Nami later deemed impossible). After the accident that compressed his body, Gaimon adapted the best he could, and is able to perform most day-to-day tasks with his hands and feet (though he can no longer manage full-body movements such as climbing). According to him, the bulk of his body has atrophied so much that it cannot survive without the chest, leaving him severely disadvantaged against those he cannot intimidate or otherwise deceive. Gaimon carries at least one pistol at all times, having somehow maintained powder and shot for it despite being stranded for decades from any civilization. He is a marksman of at least some proficiency, preferring to shoot enemies from behind."},

He has a pair of curved horns which point upward, and are significantly longer than those of his fellow Numbers. His mouth contains long pointed teeth, with two pairs of longer fangs on the top and bottom of his mouth respectively. He has very long, bushy light hair, wears no clothing on his upper body. On his left shoulder is a tattoo of the daiji  (\"two\"). Unlike the other Numbers, Fuga has a centaur body; everything from the waist down is the body of a horse. This is due to consuming one of the Beasts Pirates' SMILE fruits.", "personality": "Fuga is very headstrong; when he noticed Scratchmen Apoo pursuing Yamato, he immediately decided to chase after him as well and create significant collateral damage in the process.

He wears a pair of square-shaped sunglasses and a purple kimono with a pattern of yellow rimmed, green circles with three white dots in them, as well the Japanese character  (nin?) on his orange obi. Twenty years ago, his head and earlobes were shorter and he did not have a beard. His kimono had a simpler design with the kanji  (ban?) on each side.", "personality": "Despite the samurai code of loyalty stipulating that a warrior must remain loyal to their master as long as they (the warrior) live, Fukurokuju sees no point in serving a dead master and believes his duty as a ninja is to serve the current shogun, regardless of how that shogun came into power. This led him to serve Orochi without issue after the latter seized the shogunate from the Kozuki Family, and he questioned Raizo and the Nine Red Scabbards' devotion to Kozuki Oden even after Oden's death, saying they are following a \"ghost\". He was even willing to pledge himself and the rest of the Oniwabanshu to Kaidou, a pirate, after Kaidou had seemingly killed Orochi, though he would later return to Orochi's service after the two of them reunited and began fighting Kaidou's Beasts Pirates on Orochi's behalf; it is unclear what exactly transpired and what Fukurokuju knew between Orochi's seeming death and their reunion. Fukurokuju has disdain for showing emotion and believes that being emotional will prevent one from ever being an effective shinobi, regardless of their skill in ninjutsu. Despite disdaining emotional expression, Fujurojuku would express panic and fear whenever Orochi is angry or in dangerous situations as he started panic when his robes caught fire while under Raizo's Paralysis technique. While vigilant in enforcing Orochi's objectives and protecting the shogun, he was patient enough to give Nico Robin one chance to explain herself when she was caught snooping around Orochi Castle. He has shown to be sadistic as he eagerly awaited Oden's death in his painful execution, and mocked Shinobu for putting her hopes on Oden.", "abilities_and_powers": "As former captain of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Fukurokuju once had full control over the group of 5,000 ninja, formerly in service of Orochi, but currently Kaidou. Fukurokuju has been noted to be an extremely skilled master of ninjutsu by Shinobu, a veteran kunoichi. He is stated to be the biggest rival of Raizo, a ninja once affiliated with the Oniwabanshu who has been reputed as a genius since his youth. Fukurokuju is quite adept at physical combat, unusually using his earlobes like whips as his signature method of fighting. He also possesses enough mental clarity to see through Raizo's \"clone\" technique and strike the ninja's real body. Fukurokuju was shown carrying a sword 20 years ago."},

He dresses in black formal wear and has green, well groomed hair, purple dimples on his cheeks and strands of hair on his chin. He also sports red wristbands. As part of CP0, Fukurou now wears a white suit and a different haircut. He also now wears dark shades. In SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. As a child, Fukurou had a black belt in an unnamed martial arts. He also had the zipper across his mouth. He also wore sunglasses.", "personality": "Despite having the ability to \"zip it\", his biggest personality quirk is having a big mouth (both figuratively and literally); he also has the strange habit of saying \"chapapa\" after almost every sentence and has a strangely high voice considering his bulky appearance. He often blurts things out inconsiderately; in the mission they had before the Straw Hat Pirates invaded Enies Lobby, he announced his team's presence to the town and their intentions forcing them to kill an additional 20 people instead of only the three that were slated for assassination. Also, moments before Fukurou announced that, he told Spandam and Kumadori that Jabra had a girlfriend named Gatherine, who worked in Enies Lobby's cafeteria as a waitress. However, he unfortunately was dumped by her only days before Straw Hat Pirates' assault on Enies Lobby began. Strangely, he calls himself \"Fukurou the Silent\", and not as strangely adds: \"Lover of Rumors\". He is also a prideful individual as he stopped dodging Franky's attacks after the latter accused him of being a coward and proceeded to trade punches with him. He also exchanged childish insults with the cyborg on how \"weak\" Franky's punches were while Franky was out of cola and later let Franky attack him with \"Strong Hammer\" after the latter was recharged with cola by Chopper, thinking that Franky's punch would be useless against his Tekkai which led him to be severely injured as the punch proved too strong for his defense. He is shown to care for his comrades as he panicked when Chopper locked Kumadori in a fridge and tried to free him and later, he worked hard along with his comrades to raise money to pay the fees for Lucci's treatment after he was seriously injured by Luffy. He also enjoyed spending time and doing activites together with them while in St. Poplar.", "abilities_and_powers": "From his training in the Rokushiki martial arts, Fukurou has great superhuman physical strength. With a Doriki of 800, he could punch with extreme force, able to damage Franky's cybernetically enhanced durability. He is extremely agile for his size, able to move at incredible speed when using Soru. He could perform Geppo with one leg, able to levitate both himself and Franky, a very heavy cyborg, when the latter was holding onto his other leg. He has vast endurance, able to withstand multiple powerful punches from Franky that can easily break his Tekkai and even a full Cola powered Strong Hammer that sent him flying. Fukurou grew stronger in the two years since CP9's defeat, as he was reinstated and promoted to CP0. Fukurou's special te-awase ability allows him to measure the Doriki of his fellow teammates, giving an unbiased and honest ranking of CP9 by power. This ranking, however, does not account for Devil Fruit powers, only physical strength. Fukurou claims he is a master of the Soru technique, and is the first CP9 agent to have used any variations of the move. He says that in this way he is like an owl, unseen and unheard by its prey until it is too late. Fukurou's fighting style revolves mostly around a refined Shigan (the Jugon technique), and his strange body frame seems to require him to perform some of the Rokushiki slightly differently than the other CP9 agents do. With a Doriki of 800, Fukurou is one of the weaker members of CP9, but nonetheless is easily powerful enough to damage the cyborg Franky.

He has gills on his massive neck (although they may just be stripes) and a dark blue tail with light blue polka-dots. He wears a dark garment around his waist, held up by an extremely long sash. He also dons a light blue long band, which passes over his shoulders, drawing a circle around the back of his neck, and falls down to his waist, seemingly floating behind him; something all of the three brothers sport, as well as their mother and sister in a fashion, quite possibly implying it is a sign of the Royal Family, or they simply share taste in clothing. He carries around a gold trident with him. In his youth, his appearance was virtually the same, except his facial features were less serious and sharp. When he and his family arrived at the Red Port for the Levely, he wore a light colored shirt.", "personality": "He has a great sense of responsibility, as he himself went to look for the crew who had entered the island illegally in case they were the Straw Hats instead of just sending his guards, to deliver Jinbe's message personally. He has a very serious demeanor, but is also polite, as he apologized for bothering the mermaids when he was about to leave the cove, and forgiving, letting the same mermaids go unpunished after discovering they were hiding the Straw Hat Pirates. He also seems to be very reasonable and wise as seen how he handled the hostage situation in Ryugu Palace and not losing his temper. He did not show any animosity towards the Straw Hats and he respectfully conceded to Zoro's demands to reach a mutually beneficial solution. He is very loyal as he did not disregard his promise to Jinbe in delivering his messages to the Straw Hats even though the said pirates \"took over\" the Ryugu Palace. However, when he does lose his temper, he becomes very vicious towards the source of his anger, such as when he brutally defeated Dosun and his men for forcing citizens to step on his mother's photo. Also, when she was mortally wounded, he swore revenge on the one who committed this crime until Otohime calmed him down and made him promise not to hate them on her behalf. After seeing how Shirahoshi honored their mother's last wish, Fukaboshi decided to do the same, saying that he does not hate the imprisoned Hody Jones for killing their mother. He is also shown to be very thoughtful. Unlike the citizens who quickly jumped to conclusions, Fukaboshi suspected something was not right when Luffy was considered an enemy, having a feeling that the Straw Hats are not as bad as the situation made them out to be. When Luffy selflessly helped defend Ryugu Kingdom, Fukaboshi apologized to Luffy for ever doubting him. Like his mother, Otohime, Fukaboshi strongly supports peace and cooperation with humans. When Hody attempts to spread his hatred and vengeance, Fukaboshi confronts him to keep his mother's ideals alive. He appears to be philosophical, stating that the regrets of the dead belong to the dead alone and that grudge is only an illusion created by the living. He also regrets that even he held subconscious spite towards humans, although he is one of the most accepting of all the mermen seen thus far. Along with his father, he is remorseful about leaving the segregated Fish-Man District to fester and grow apart in the darkness of the seafloor, allowing the district's denizens to grow wilder and more hateful of humans. This segregation is acknowledged and modified thanks to Neptune, showing that Fukaboshi and his family are the rare type of royalty in the world, in that they are philanthropic and just, and heavily oppose a caste system which is mundane throughout the surface world. He seems perceptive of at least Luffy's abilities, as he was not surprised when seeing Luffy used Haki on a sea monster. He is also the most serious of the three princes.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a prince of the Ryugu Kingdom, he has a great deal of authority in the country. As the eldest of his siblings, he is the next in line for the throne. Alongside Ryuboshi and Manboshi, Fukaboshi is one of the three strongest in the Neptune Army. The Minister of the Right also claimed that the Straw Hats would be in trouble if they were confronted by the princes, however the minister underestimated the Straw Hats. Furthermore, Neptune ordered the Minister of the Right to immediately contact Fukaboshi following the New Fish-Man Pirate's invasion, suggesting that Fukaboshi is capable of handling such stressful situations. He also appears to be familiar with Haki, as he was not surprised when Luffy tamed one of the New Fish-Man Pirates' beasts, and commented that it was expected. He was also shown to be able to somewhat sense that Mary Geoise's travelators were powered by slaves. However, it is unknown if he can use the ability as well. Fukaboshi has formidable physical strength. In the anime, he could stop Dosun, an extremely strong and large hammerhead shark fish-man and officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, from using his giant hammer to attack Ryugu Kingdom's citizens with one hand before defeating him without having any injuries after his fight. Further testament to his strength is when he and his two brothers alone took down the giant sized sea beasts that easily felled the rest of the Neptune Army including the two ministers. Fukaboshi and his brothers also had the upper hand against the officers of the New Fish-Man Pirates. The officers had to resort to using Energy Steroids in order to defeat the princes. He possess incredible endurance, as he was able to help Luffy immediately after he was released despite his injuries caused in the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates' Officers in addition to a brutal barrage of Yabusame from Hody, who was transformed after an overdose on Energy Steroids. Also, he took two brutal slashes from Hody's Kirisame and he was able to recover in a few seconds. Fukaboshi carries around a trident, similar to the those used by the Ammo Knights, and has shown amazing skill in wielding it, being capable, with the aid of his brothers, of dispatching a group of enormous, drug-enhanced sea monsters with a single attack.

He has an almost cleft lip-like mouth and a unique hairstyle, with his hair split into two spikes pointing upwards. He has thick, triangular eyebrows, and is almost always seen grinning. His nose is also colored red, and it is long just like the nose of Kaku and Usopp. These characteristics make him look like a fox. Foxy typically wears yellow-orange pants, held up by suspenders, with large, rotund buckles on the edges, tucked inside black boots, which are white on the front part of the legs and have orange strings. Under his pants some sort of strange indument circling his waist can be seen, which is light-green with leaf-like motifs on it, and has orange laces on the front. It might be some sort of belt, even though in the anime it was shown as a pair of bermuda-like indument. In front of this, threaded in his pants, Foxy carries around a short wooden sword, which he uses to perform his Noro Noro Beam Sword technique. He has an elaborate necklace hanging on his chest, with many circular orange and yellow pendants, and a blue, bigger and more elaborate central one, with ears on it resembling those of a fox. He also sports a fur-lined coat, with a large collar and big buttons on the right side. His coat is colored purple in the anime, while it is colored silver in the manga and other manga related media.", "personality": "Foxy is a cheater and trickster, who participates in the Davy Back Fight, a contest between pirate crews where the winning team can steal crew members from the losing team. Most of the members of Foxy's crew joined him because he won them in this contest. However, they seem to be genuinely enthusiastic about being in the Foxy Pirates, and wholeheartedly cheer on their crewmates and captain in the Davy Back Fight. Foxy also seems to honor a team's choice if they were to decide to win on their own. He thinks very highly of himself and believes that he is good-looking. Though he acts supremely confident most of the time and seems quite fond of himself, Foxy is extremely sensitive to insults or criticism. Any offensive words from others cause him to instantly become depressed, and he usually ends up losing his footing and falling to the ground, barely supporting himself with his arms, while a black cloud suddenly appears over his head. Though all it takes is a few kind words from anybody to perk him up again. In the anime, Nami and Usopp used this weakness to their advantage by alternately hurling insults and compliments at Foxy non-stop, leaving him emotionally (as well as physically) paralyzed and unable to help his team during the roller race.", "abilities_and_powers": "Foxy is a very cunning combatant, willing to exploit his Devil Fruit powers as well as any weapon or tool at his disposal to supplement his cheating. He also seems to have an extraordinary memory and timekeeping sense, enough to keep track of multiple time-slowed cannonballs and even use them as platforms. Despite his unassuming physique, Foxy served as a former champion boxer fifteen years before delving into piracy. His considerable power and boxing expertise proved to match Monkey D. Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gatling blow-for-blow. Foxy ate the Noro Noro no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to emit special unique microscopic photon particles as beams of light. Anything hit by these photons, both living and non-living things, will be trapped in a state of slow motion for 30 seconds (he demonstrates this by slowing down a cannon ball fired at him, only to get hit by the cannonball anyway when he was gloating over his power for too long). Even Foxy himself is not immune to his own power. In battle, he can use this power to slow down his opponents, either giving him ample opportunity to escape and/or set up one of his underhanded schemes. Additionally while someone is trapped in slow motion, any hit they take will affect them in slow motion and return to normal speed when they do. Because of this, Foxy can strike his opponents multiple times while they are slowed down so that they experienced all the accumulated strikes when they return to normal speed. Because the beam is made of light, it can be reflected by a mirror. When Foxy uses his Noro Noro no Mi powers, he always holds his hands in the same position: his thumb, ring and middle fingers are pressed together while his other two fingers are pointing upwards. This gesture resembles the typical Japanese way of representing a fox with one's hands. Apart from his regular tricks, Foxy possesses a giant mechanical punching machine called the Gorilla Puncher #13 (13, Gorira Panch Jsan-g?) which he can pilot to use against his opponent in the Combat portion of the Davy Back Fight. The machine's punches are capable of being set on fire and are supposedly even capable of burning sea monsters. Foxy also uses a giant ball launcher called Dead Hit-kun (, Deddo Hitto-kun?). Foxy is also seen using boxing gloves with spikes, similar to what Porchemy is seen with, during his fight with Luffy. He also has a short wooden sword he uses in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers. Aside from his Devil Fruit powers, Foxy uses various other tricks that are not dependent on his powers. These range from disguises to using equipment that would otherwise be considered cheating in normal standards. The following are named techniques of Foxy that do not use his Devil Fruit powers:"},

He wears sunglasses over his eyes and has pronounced lips, and his hair is a massive pompadour resembling a chicken's tail. He has a tattoo of the number 4 on both his left cheek and on the left side of his chicken's head, as well as a tattoo of the word \"Tricks\" on his forehead over his left eye. He has normal arms stretching down from the top of the chicken's backside, but his legs seem to have transformed into those of a chicken.", "personality": "Fourtricks is very confident in his abilities, expressing disapproval at the loud fear of his subordinates and saying that truly strong fighters stay quiet.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Shinuchi, Fourtricks has authority over the lower-ranking members of the Beasts Pirates.

Fourtricks ate a Chicken SMILE (SMILE, Niwatori no Sumairu?), which transformed his torso into an entire chicken with his legs turning into chicken legs. Unlike a normal Zoan user, rather than his head becoming a chicken's head, the chicken has a sentient head of its own while Fourtricks' body is located in its backside. No combat applications of this fruit have been seen so far. In the anime, the chicken was strong enough to lift up a full grown man using it's beak. Fourtricks wields a polearm with a short blade at the end, though has not been shown using it in combat."},
{"name": "Franky", "episode": "Episode 329", "chapter": "Chapter 233", "year": 2004, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 335. His birth name, Cutty Flam, was revealed in Chapter 346.", "appearance": "As a direct result of the modifications that he conducted upon himself as well as the years spent as a ship dismantler, bounty hunter, and street thug in Water 7, Franky is a powerfully built man with a height of at least seven feet, making him the third-tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, after Jinbe and Brook. His forearms are relatively enormous while his biceps are comparably small. His chest is well-toned with large abs and pectoral muscles. He has brightly colored blue hair and blue star tattoos on his forearms. Franky's eyebrows are rather long and stern, and he has three prominent lower Matsuge on each eye. His chin is very angular and tapers off in three pointed clefts. Franky has an equally angular prosthetic nose made of iron with several rivets and jagged edges, the only replacement part of his exterior body that is not covered in artificial skin. Before being hit by the Puffing Tom, Franky's forearms were normal-sized, and his overall height was comparably smaller than his cyborg-enhanced self would be. He also had an ordinary nose and chin, both of which were later badly broken in the accident, causing him to repair them with iron. His choice of clothing usually comprises of a swim briefs, which causes people to call him a pervert, and an open loud Hawaiian \"Aloha\" shirt with a large golden chain necklace around his neck. It is rare for him to button up his shirt, have long sleeves, and wear pants or footwear unless the situation calls for it, or someone makes him do so. He also does not like it when people tamper with his look, as seen when Nami's mind was inside his body and she tried to button up his Hawaiian shirt, which made Franky upset. Before becoming a cyborg, Franky went half-dressed simply because he wanted to. Now, his cyborg body is built in a way that covering himself up actually limits him from accessing its features (long sleeves prevent him from using weapons installed on his arms, a buttoned shirt stops him from accessing his chest panels, pants keep him from using features on his legs that cause them to separate or expand, shoes are a hindrance for the same reason and also redundant because his feet are toughened with iron). If in a battle, Franky will strip down for the sake of using his weapons or wear specially modified clothing that can transform along with him. Conversely, Franky always makes sure to cover his back (hence, he wears a shirt) because it is a weak spot- it is still flesh and blood, the only part of his body he cannot reach and modify. Unfortunately, Franky is still susceptible to cold and can suffer chills from his half-nakedness. During his first appearance in the Water 7 Arc, Franky wore a masked costume as a disguise so no one could identify him while he bought wood from the Adam tree off the black market. After discarding this disguise, for the rest of the arc all the way up to the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a red Hawaiian shirt, with lime green palm trees decorating it. During the Thriller Bark Arc, Franky wore a yellow shirt with purple trident-like symbols on the sides and a large one on back. Near the end of the previous arc all the way up to the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Franky switched to wearing a purple version of his Hawaiian shirt. During the Straw Hats separation, Franky wore a red coat to protect himself from the cold while on Baldimore, but after blowing up Vegapunk's laboratory, the skin on his face and frontal body was burned off, revealing his metal endoskeleton underneath, which he covered up with a tiger skin rug due to scaring people who looked at him. He also has a pair of sunglasses, which he usually wears when things start to get serious. Over the two years he was on his own, Franky used Vegapunk's blueprints to drastically reconfigure his body, repairing the damage he accidentally caused to himself and replacing some old functions his body used to have with better and more powerful implements. Franky's hair is now controllable and can change different styles instantly by pushing his nose for more than three seconds. While he used to wear it up in a pompadour style, he now frequently changes his hairstyle, typically whenever he wears a new outfit. However, he reverts to his original pompadour style whenever he is inside General Franky. He also has two stitch-mark scars on his torso running down from the back of his neck indicating that he had sewn his skin back on. He appears to have made modifications to his eyes as well. What appears to be his eyes are actually lenses that resemble human eyes over a pair of robotic eyes underneath. His left eye was seen with inverse coloration and with a glowing red pupil after his battle with Senor Pink, after being knocked around so much it caused the lens over the eye to fall out. Once the fighting against the Donquixote Pirates had come to a close and Franky had some downtime to repair himself, he installed a replacement lens. His shoulders, torso, and arms are also much bigger than before, and with studded hands that look almost robotic in appearance, but he also revealed that inside of his huge arms he still has a set of normal-sized robotic hands. He now appears to be wearing metal rigged suspenders. He has replaced his elbows with large, light blue hinges, his shoulders with a large red ball and socket joint with \"BF-37\" written on them, and his forearms with large, light blue cubes, with his trademark star tattoo being split by an edge. Surprisingly, Franky's forearms also have hair on them even though they are clearly robotic, and his large robot hands can even wear gloves. These new features house upgrades he gave himself during the timeskip. He now wears a red coconut tree-motived Hawaiian shirt and red swim briefs. While on Punk Hazard, he was given a large double-breasted black coat by Kin'emon for the cold. When he was able to change into winter attire, he put on a sky-blue double-breasted coat with \"BF 37\" written on the front and back and paired it with a dark navy-blue scarf with red polka dots. During the Dressrosa Arc, Franky wore a white dress shirt and black suit jacket, a bowler hat, as well as his typical swim briefs. He initially had his hair in two long pigtails. After Dressrosa Operation: SOP began, he reformed his hair to resemble a cannon, which comically was only cosmetic. After the battle against the Doflamingo Family, he wore a white tank top with 'Corrida' written across it. He also reformed his hair to resemble Usopp's hat during the Dressrosa Arc. During the Zou Arc, Franky wore a black v-neck t-shirt with four symbols on it arranged in a square pattern (An \"I\", \"H\", \"T\", and a sun-like symbol). He reformed his hair into an undercut style similar in appearance to Smoker's post-timeskip hairstyle. Later on, he re-styles it again to resemble a blue whale. In the Wano Country Arc, Franky wears a dark blue yukata workman coat with kanji on the v of the chest and symbols around the belt. He has red cloth draped around his shoulders and his hair is reformed to resemble a hammer. During the raid on Onigashima, Franky changes the appearance of his arms, with the red ball and socket joint now sporting a white line with curved lined patterns and reddish-orange dot pattern atop, instead of the usual \"BF-37\" pattern. Franky's forearms are now black in color with a grey line, and he is wearing a grey polka-dotted black Hawaiian shirt with what appears to be two large grey buttons, and two grey shoulder cannons protruding from his upper back. He also wears a special Kabuto helmet with a star pattern, with a large ornamental crescent moon atop the helmet, and a red and white loincloth and a large yellow nio-dasuki on his back. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities to disguise them, Franky wore a Beasts Pirates disguise, with Franky changing his hair style to resemble horns. During the Egghead Arc, Franky changes into a full body hooded jumpsuit with a bottom half of the jumpsuit being darker in color and a belt with a star shaped buckle. He also wears a unique headset with a turn key shaped top, a futuristic visor and a pair of DOM Shoes."},

{"name": "Fisher Tiger", "episode": "Episode 521", "chapter": "Chapter 415", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Tiger, as a sea bream Fish-Man, had round eyes, salmon-pink colored skin, a flat nose, wide lips with slight peach fuzz, a thick dark beard and sideburns, and a spiky dorsal fin on the back of his head, sprouting from under his long, curly hair. He was an exceptionally large Fish-Man, with a broad and muscular physique, and extremely thick neck, and long legs that were quite thin in comparison to the rest of his body. The crew's Jolly Roger was on the center of his chest, covering his slave brand. As an adventurer, he wore a dark olive bandana and a dark-blue T-shirt with a picture on it portraying a pink hippo with its mouth wide-open, which read: Frog? No - Hippo, paired with plain pants held up by a belt and simple sandals. He was also seen carrying around a large backpack, with many pockets and a coil of rope attached to it. As the captain of the Sun Pirates, he switched to a camouflage patterned bandanna, paired with a sleeveless, open shirt, which bore the same pattern as his bandanna during his first appearance, but was later changed to a simple striped one, revealing his muscular chest and his crews tattoo, and black pants, but retained his sandals. The most visible addition was a captain's coat which hung from his shoulders like a cape, and sported the crew's Jolly Roger on the back. When he was younger, he did not have any peach fuzz above his lips, nor did he have his trademark beard, and his hair was shorter and notably straight. He donned what appeared to be a simple A-shirt.", "personality": "According to Boa Hancock, Tiger was a reckless person and very brutal, as he was believed to have challenged Mary Geoise and burned the entire city down to free all Fish-Man slaves. However, this was only due to Hancock's first impression, and contrary to it, Tiger was compassionate and very merciful. He did not approve of senseless violence, as he ordered Jinbe and Arlong not to kill any humans. He was very idealistic, making the principles of liberation and freedom the basics of the Sun Pirates, and worrying that Queen Otohime might have compared him to the bloodthirsty and cruel Arlong. Before he attacked Mary Geoise, he appeared to be friendly, greeting Jinbe and Arlong as close friends after returning to Fish-Man Island from an adventure. After the attack, he got more serious, yet remained friendly enough to treat others with respect. While Queen Otohime wished for interspecies cooperation between Fish-Men and humans, Tiger, up to the moment of his death, seemingly believed that Fish-Men and humans should remain separate. Even though he hated humans, according to Hancock, he did not discriminate against them when it came to slavery, and liberated every one of them during his raid of the holy city. He also did not believe in revenge on humans for their discrimination, thinking that it would only cause more hatred and resentment. His compassion to humans was further demonstrated when he vowed to take a child who was a former slave back to her hometown, going as far as to mark her with his own jolly roger to lift the burden of slavery off her back. Tiger did smile happily when Koala was reunited with her family, and it was an immensely symbolic final act for a man who had lived such a dualistic life as adventurer, hero, slave and pirate captain, as the town gladly accepted Koala back while condemning Tiger to death and betraying him to the Marines. There was also a darker side to Tiger's personality, as he claimed that the \"demons\" residing inside him were the most terrifying ones; a statement which left Jinbe blank, suggesting his crew did not know about this trait of him. This, along with the depths of his personality, were all revealed in his deathbed: after being captured and enslaved by the World Nobles and escaping, he saw the \"madness\" of humans, and grew to hate them for it. Despite this, he agreed with Otohime's ideology of improving relationships between the two races and regretted making it difficult with his own actions. He tried to befriend humans, but being betrayed by Koala's townspeople drove him to realize that no matter how much effort he put in, he could never love a human. To this end, he refused a transfusion of human blood due to it being tainted with hatred for Fish-Men. Since he could not accept humans despite trying his hardest, his last hope on changing the interspecies relationship was the next era, such as Koala, who does not know about the hatred, and asked his crew not to reveal the tragedy that befell the Sun Pirates, nor their hatred towards humanity.", "abilities_and_powers": "Tiger is a legendary figure among Fish-Men, known for his many feats and his amazing will. Without fearing the consequences of challenging the World Nobles and their guards, he proceeded to rampage across Mary Geoise and free all the slaves imprisoned there, including both fish-men and humans. Not only did he succeed in performing such an astonishing deed, he also founded and became the captain of the Sun Pirates, the strongest and largest pirate crew composed of fish-men to ever roam the Grand Line. It was from this group that several other Fish-Man pirate crews came from. His notoriety from the events at Mary Geoise and his status as the captain of the Sun Pirates eventually earned him a bounty of 230,000,000, an impressive feat, considering it was his first bounty. In his younger days, he was able to command the Fish-Men District with his strength and in the anime, he was also able to defeat both Arlong and Jinbe (who already had a black belt in Fish-Man Karate as a child) as well as the rest of his future crewmen to gain their loyalty. Even before achieving his legendary status, he was a famous adventurer in his own right and kept in high regard by the inhabitants of Fish-Man Island, who were more than willing to hear of his numerous adventures. During one such adventure, Tiger was taken as a slave by the World Nobles, and yet managed to escape, something which prompted him to attack Mary Geoise in order to free all the other slaves. Tiger possessed extraordinary charisma and leadership, having managed to form the Sun Pirates, an enormous Fish-Man pirate crew consisting of both former Fish-Man slaves and other Fish-Men who simply joined Tiger solely out of admiration, including Arlong and Jinbe. Tiger was an extremely skilled shipwright, having built his own pirate ship. As a fish-man, he was ten times stronger than a human, and twice that in water. However, he was extremely strong compared to other individuals of his race, as evidenced by the fact that he was the captain of an entire crew of fish-men only. He climbed the Red Line with his bare hands before single-handedly invading the extremely well-guarded Holy Land of Mary Geoise alone and freeing all the slaves by himself. He can break a cannon with his grip and defeat Kadar, a Marine rear admiral, with just a single kick to the face. He also possessed immense stamina and endurance. Even after being shot many times from all directions, which would lead to fatal blood loss that resulted in his death, he managed to resist and fight back against the ambushing Marines to the end, a feat which was commented upon by the ones assaulting him. He is also extremely fast, even on dry land. Even when severely injured, he could dash towards an attacking Marine in a moment and send him flying away with a punch without the Marine managing to react or shoot him. During his attack on Mary Geoise, he was seen carrying many weapons. He wielded a large saber and a massive pistol. He also had two more sheathed swords by his side and a bazooka-like weapon strapped to his back."},

He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power. As a result, he has authority to declare a Buster Call, and he and the other Elders can use their great influence and power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century. The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is Imu. Nusjuro has an ability that allows him to transform into a tall, lanky bipedal creature with a pronounced humanoid head and a large ring-like appendage on his back. In this form, he could withstand a point-blank blast of fire from Sabo without difficulty. It is unknown if this power is related to a Zoan-type Devil Fruit. Nusjuro carries a long katana with him, bearing a saya with a distinctly wooden appearance as well as a tsuba shaped like a rounded-out cross patte, thus reminiscent of the Kitetsu line of swords originating in Wano. Nusjuro has been seen personally polishing his sword's blade with an uchiko silk ball, and while his actual skill in wielding the weapon remains unknown, Nusjuro did unsheathe it when intending to assassinate King Cobra."},

{"name": "Eustass Kid", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Kid is a tall, muscular man with light skin and bright red hair, resembling flames. His nose has a particular shape, being quite pointed and having little protrusions on both sides. He has dark reddish, purple-colored lips and fingernails, red/orange eyes and no eyebrows. He dresses in an extravagant attire consisting of black and yellow lizard-print pants with a red fringe, motorcycle boots, and a blue sash under a green belt fastened by a large circular buckle with a four-leaf clover-like pattern in the middle. He also has a slim bandolier, also with minuscule bolts that go diagonally over his right shoulder then ties to his waist, where he keeps a dagger with a Japanese-style hilt and what appears to be a flintlock gun. He also has gold bangles around both wrists. He wears a pair of studded, square shaped goggles on his forehead, and a large fur captain's coat over his bare muscular torso. The dark brown coat is adorned with spikes on its shoulders lined in maroon. The collar of the coat is extremely flared and wide. He typically wears this coat with his right arm in its sleeve and his left arm under the coat itself. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Kid is shown with spikier and more spread-out hair, similar to a lion's mane. He also wore larger and rounder goggles and did not have dark lips. He was depicted tinkering with a toy robot with a wrench. His blue sleeveless shirt has a sewn patch, like his yellow striped pants, and has a patch. After the timeskip, he is shown with slightly longer hair that appears to be pushed back. He also has a large scar that drags from the left side of his forehead, goes down his neck and another smaller one that goes through his left eye. There are two parallel scars on his lower right arm also. He lost his left arm to just above the elbow during the two-year timeskip in a battle against the Red Hair Pirates, and until his imprisonment by the Beasts Pirates, he replaced it with a mechanical one that is somehow connected to his nervous system, shown by the presence of several metallic wires embedded directly into his skin. The mechanical arm was damaged in his fight against Kaidou, and later stripped from him to disarm him and put him at further disadvantage if he rebelled against his captor. His attire consists of his trademark spotted pants, a black opened vest, held down by a belted war kilt. He also has a long dark red coat, worn over his shoulders. He appears to have become more muscular and also has scars on his right forearm, left pectoral, and on the left side of his abdomen. He no longer wears any impractical jewelry. During the raid on Onigashima, he assembled a new mechanical arm. It was later temporarily severed due to Hawkins' damage transfer, but was ultimately repaired.", "personality": "Kid comes off as a rude, vicious and bloodthirsty pirate, notorious for causing huge amounts of civilian casualties. Whenever feeling like he is being mocked or insulted, even though a glance, he is quick to resort to violence. In fact, Kid can be so violent that he considers the choice of not immediately killing someone in his direct vicinity an act of gratitude. He also seems to be cruel even when not provoked, crucifying another defeated pirate crew just because he deemed them too weak to roam around in the New World. Kid is overall highly temperamental and has little patience with anyone getting in his way, although he is capable of restraining his anger in certain situations.Kid can also be very petty, having killed countless civilians for merely mocking or laughing at him for his dream of being the Pirate King, killing several pirates in the New World for being weak, and attempting to kill Shanks' fleet solely to goad the Emperor to fight him. Kid is bold, cocky and fearless, known to run into danger regardless of the consequences. This is particularly the case when dealing with people who previously wronged him, at which point Kid will throw all caution to the wind and go straight for revenge. He does not hesitate to challenge even the Four Emperors, having previously fought Kaidou and Shanks and destroyed two ships belonging to Big Mom. Kid rarely backs down from a battle and may fight a powerful enemy until his last breath. The fact that he did not join the Beasts Pirates despite not standing a chance against Kaidou is a testament to Kid's disposition. Kid seems to believe that possessing the determination to achieve the impossible is necessary to survive in the New World, and that anyone who does not is as good as dead. Kid is very prideful of his reputation and aims to reach a top spot in the world of piracy, which he plans to achieve by beating the Four Emperors, even if it means dying for it. That said, Kid has no interest in utilizing weapons of mass destruction (although he is curious about their existence) or other tools that could help him achieve those goals, instead just preferring to confront them head on with his own power. Because of this, he dislikes joining forces with others and sharing his targets with them, thinking that they will just interfere in what should be his fight alone. He also hates being the subject of false rumors that paint him in a negative light, being quick to clarify them if he overhears someone talking about him. Because of his pride, Kid is notorious for being unreasonably stubborn, unwilling to back down no matter how impossible the task is. Despite this stubbornness, Kid has shown moments of maturity, willing to put his pride aside to work with his fellow Worst Generation members in overthrowing the Emperors of the Sea. Kid is shown to be quite cynical about the World Government. He is not blind to the way the World Nobles act, remarking that, compared to them, pirates are almost humane in nature and honest about their faults, unlike the Nobles that justify their abuses of power through ancestry. After Camie had been sold in the Human Auctioning House to Charlos, Kid declared that the whole affair was a \"farce\" and similarly held a similar point of view regarding the broadcast of the Summit War of Marineford, calling it a \"charade\". For this reason, he felt amusement and catharsis when the world noble Charlos was punched down by an irate Luffy. Kid has the same dream as Luffy: to find One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Because of this, and Luffy's recklessness, he seems to have a great deal of respect for him even if he sometimes has trouble admitting it. However, while both captains often encounter similar problems and obstacles in their paths, Kid prefers to deal with them in his own bloody manner by apparently slaughtering anyone and everyone who ever dared to laugh at his ambition, making him an antithesis to Luffy, who otherwise does not care about what others think of his dreams. Surprisingly, belying his rough attitude, Kid can be childishly competitive and will mock his rivals any chance he gets, especially when Luffy and Law are involved. Another similarity Kid has to Luffy is a strong degree of affection for his crewmates. Kid will recklessly defend or rescue his subordinates if they are mocked or in danger. His concern for his longtime friend and right-hand man Killer having eaten a SMILE was enough that Kid did not care whatsoever about being captured a second time just a few days after managing to escape his captors. Kid is also rather gluttonous, not minding hard labor as long as he gets access to large amounts of food. Unlike Luffy, however, Kid is rather unfriendly and mistrusting of others, rarely leaving his guard down and warning his subordinates to follow suit. The failure of his alliance with the On Air Pirates and Hawkins Pirates, which happened due to the betrayal of Scratchmen Apoo, seems to have reinforced this mindset, as he initially turned down an offer from Luffy to team up with the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance. Kid would eventually change his mind, but still acted as a reluctant ally for the most part, only joining forces with Luffy for the sake of their rivalry. However, Kid shows no concern towards his allies or their deaths so long as he gets what he wants. This turns out to be a flaw of Kid, as during his rematch against Shanks and his fleet, Kid approached his fleet without any allies around to help him and it costs him and his crew their ship and their Road Ponyglyph rubbings because of his pride.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the captain of the Kid Pirates, Kid has complete authority over the crew. As a member of the Worst Generation, he is a powerful pirate. Prior to the timeskip, he had a reward of 315,000,000, the highest among the Eleven Supernovae at the time, for dealing major destruction and civilian casualties along their route through the Grand Line and towards the New World. In the Human Auctioning House, he effortlessly defeated a large group of Marines alongside Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law. Later, he along with his crew also managed to escape from a Pacifista and Admiral Kizaru. After the timeskip, Kid appears to have become much more powerful, surviving the Red Hair Pirates to a battle and wounding one of Big Mom's Sweet Commanders, as well as later destroying two ships belonging to her. His bounty rose to 470,000,000. During the Raid on Onigashima, he has shown to be powerful enough to fight against the two Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom, dealing damage to them despite their near-impenetrable defenses. Later, Kid briefly faced Big Mom, in a singles match, before wrestling, alongside Law, in a match receiving Hawkins' damage. After she had been empowered with a year of her life, while wielding her special Homies, Hera, Prometheus, and Napoleon, all of whom had grown stronger and more in sync, the two Supernovas, often using their awakened powers managed to push Big Mom towards her limits and landing a devastating blow against the feared Emperor, resulting in her eventual defeat. Having defeated the former Emperor, Big Mom, Kid gained a bounty of 3,000,000,000, making him one of the most dangerous pirates in the world, with his new bounty matching that of the current Emperor and rival, Monkey D Luffy. However, in spite of his increase in strength, he still is no match for an Emperor head on, having been easily defeated by Shanks alone due to having overestimated his own strength compared to the Emperor, a mistake that potentially cost him and his crew their lives. Kid also appears well-connected, as he is aware of dealings within the underworld and knew about Caesar Clown's experiments. Additionally, Kid has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. Like Jinbe and Law, Kid is also immune to Big Mom's \"Soul Pocus\" due to his lack of fear towards the Emperor. Kid possesses immense physical strength and resilience. While being cuffed with Seastone, which depletes the energy of Devil Fruit users, he was able to match Luffy's speed in carrying and delivering large stone blocks bigger than him even with only one arm. He was also able to endure the torture of his imprisonment by the Beasts Pirates. More impressively, Kid has enough power to challenge and fight against two members of the Four Emperors on the roof of Onigashima, withstand multiple attacks from both Emperors, and even deal damage to both Emperors who were both known for their near invulnerable bodies. Later inside of Onigashima, he was able to battle one of the Emperors head on, being able to withstand or even overpower direct attacks from the monstrously strong Big Mom, even after she had empowered herself further with her Devil Fruit abilities. Another impressive feat was the fact that he was able to clash with her even while unknowingly under the effects of Basil Hawkins' Devil Fruit abilities. Kid has an extraordinary recovery rate, as one of the prison guards said that his body could heal in a few days. Similar to Luffy, Kid has an incredible metabolism where he can eat large amounts of food, to the point where he becomes fat and round, but instantly burns all the calories to replenish his stamina. Kid is also an extremely skilled hand-to-hand combatant. While bound by Seastone cuffs and with only one arm, he managed to defeat Dobon, a Shinuchi of the Beast Pirates, alongside Luffy. Kid also managed to escape the Udon Prisoner Mine, while still cuffed in Seastone shackles. Kid ate the Jiki Jiki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to manipulate magnetic forces. He can attract and/or repel metal objects as he pleases, and he can also create magnetic fields that allow him to arrange metal objects into various configurations and constructs. Kid can arrange the metal objects stuck to his body into a variety of shapes, with his most common technique being to form a gigantic metal arm to unleash powerful attacks with. In addition to covering his real arms with metal, Kid was also shown using his magnetism to form a rough replacement left arm after his cybernetic left arm had been removed by the Beasts Pirates. This power makes Kid a very dangerous opponent against fighters who use metal weapons, since he can either repel metal projectiles, such as cannonballs and bullets, or attract his enemies' blades and guns towards himself to use as building material for his own attacks. Kid has achieved Devil Fruit Awakening, allowing him to bestow magnetic properties onto things other than his own body. By his own admission, he has not fully mastered his awakened powers and it takes a serious toll on his stamina. Kid is one of the very few people in the world who is capable of using all three types of Haki. Despite this, he rarely uses them in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit abilities. According to Kaidou, Kid possesses the ability to use Haoshoku Haki. While he has not yet showcased his usage of it in the manga, Kid has been seen using it in both One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 and the Anime. Kid possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. Non-canonically, in One Piece: Stampede Kid showcases hardening both of his metal arms during his fight with Douglas Bullet, and in the anime he is seen hardening his arm and proceeds to then punch Poker. Kid is an extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, as he showcased during the raid on Onigashima, he was able to sense that Luffy's was defeated by Kaidou, and was also able to sense Luffy's Devil Fruit Awakening. Kid carries around a flintlock pistol and a dagger. Sometime during the timeskip, his left arm was replaced with a mechanical one, making him a cyborg."},

Epoida ate a currently unnamed Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a caterpillar. In this form, he can retain his human head and hands, but grows caterpillar-like sections on his chest, with the colored stripes on his shirt seemingly merging with them, and also larger, more rotund forearms. Epoida wields a double sided jousting lance, similar to the one Speed Jiru possesses. It can be assumed that he is proficient at using it since it was his main weapon during the battle against the Marines. He wields it by holding both of his hands on its handle and pointing it onwards with his arms above him as he charges. Epoida can also use two swords to an extent as he armed himself with a pair of swords when he prepared to descend off of Whitebeard's paddle ship. In the anime he is replaced by another ordinary pirate."},

{"name": "Enel", "episode": "Episode 254", "chapter": "Chapter 167", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned by Conis in Chapter 241.", "appearance": "Enel is a pale-skinned man with a well-toned yet somewhat wiry build, standing very tall at 266cm (8'9\"). He has a slim face, usually seen with a relaxed, half-lidded expression accentuated by a calm, confident smile. He has blond hair (platinum blond in the anime, a slightly darker shade in the manga) that is set in a large perm, albeit always tucked under a close-fitting, white skullcap. His eyebrows are contrastively black, rather thick, and top grayish-blue eyes with prominent bottom lashes. His nose is slim with a marked, flat bridge that has several lines run horizontally across it. Akin to depictions of buddhas, Enel's earlobes stretch all the way to his chest (or well below as per inconsistent portrayal, though generally longer in the manga) due to being weighed down by gold earrings with diamond-shaped pendants, which in the manga hold fitted red gems in the middle. Upon his back, stuck centrally into his shoulder blades is a large, gray ring (in place of Birkan wings) and attached to it four wooden shime-daiko drums set next to and above his head (inconsistently shown as either larger or smaller than such), each with cream-colored drum skin depicting a black mitsudomoe on the front and back, based on the drum ring associated with the Japanese thunder deity Raijin; similarly to said god's thunder creation, Enel can use those drums a medium for his electrokinesis. Enel takes to wearing a simple yet sumptuous-looking outfit, matching his \"godly\" self-image. Fond of gold, he dons plain, rigid bracelets of said material  a quadruple set worn like bangles on each forearm  and above each bare foot a wide, pearl-edged gold anklet double-lined in the middle, plus two gold rings on each hallux. Otherwise, bare above the waist, Enel's only garments are on the legs: a flowing, indigo (purple in the manga) sash encircles his waist, knotted in a small half-bow at his right hip, with one end of it hanging to near-ground level. This sash upholds a dark turquoise (lighter-blue in the manga) fabric around his waist as a wraparound skirt, draping over the back and in the front, where it slightly overlaps, forming a large divide to show off Enel's pants below. Said pants are extremely baggy, ballooning ones gathered quite a bit below the knees with separate brown, short cuffs each holding a small, gold-buckled strap of light blue. Each pant leg is patterned in bright orange: many longish, rectangular (more so obround in the anime) shapes touching in a slanting position, forming three separate rows of which the lowest comes out the cuff; the upper and middle row each tops a single row of spaced dots, numbering fewer than the aforesaid shapes, and the rest of the pants is dark bluish (black in the manga). Eight years before the beginning of the story when overthrowing Gan Fall, Enel looked the same except for his skirt piece being green and his pants being differently patterned: three black, horizontal lines with several thin spikes jutting up and down from each (the ones from one line offset to those from another so that they touched not) on orange background; in the anime, the pants instead had horizontal line pairs running close to each other and kinking up and down to form square-pointed diamond outlines.", "personality": "Enel thinks of himself as an invincible god. He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take, or destroy whatever he pleases and is capable of doing anything. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, arrogant, and without a care in the world. Enel holds no regard for any life except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands - instead, he sees it as his godly duty, and laughed maniacally as he tried to send Skypiea to its doom. He is, in short, an amoral narcissist with a God complex, which became even more obvious when he set off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his \"godly duties\" of smiting the natives of Skypiea for speaking against him, he spends his time sleeping or eating in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he is hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he is relaxed and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight in order to prove his immortality and superiority. Sometimes, against an annoying opponent like Usopp using his \"Usopp Spell\", he simply bludgeons them with his staff rather than shocking them. Due to Enel's overconfidence in his abilities in combat, unexpected scenarios throw him completely off-guard, disrupting his Mantra and therefore, impacting his fighting skill. This was shown when he desperately tried to persuade Wyper not to use the reject dial, and when he noticed that Luffy is immune to lightning, he was completely lost and visibly horrified. Nevertheless, he also gives some recognition. He was impressed with Robin's knowledge of the golden city, and he told Luffy that he was very courageous when he met him on the ark. Enel uniquely alternates between three different first person pronouns: ware (), ore (), and watashi (). Like many people, Enel has a unique laugh, with a stressed \"ya\" at the beginning: \"Yahahaha\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As a God of Skypiea, Enel had full control of the island. Enel is extremely powerful, although he appeared to be weaker than many characters as powerful as he is due to the fact that Luffy had complete immunity to most of Enel's lightning-based attacks, and was even able to strike Enel, thanks to his rubber powers. However, against almost everyone else in Skypiea, Enel appeared to be invincible as he easily defeated every opponent he faced. Enel's strength was first demonstrated when he effortlessly defeated Kamakiri and shortly after defeating another Shandia, Raki. While Wiper came close to killing Enel by using seastone and a Reject Dial, Enel was able to restart his heart and defeat Wiper. Enel has a great knowledge and awareness of objects that many Sky Islanders would usually not have, such as an understanding of what gold is, partly due to studying the ruins of Upper Yard and guarding this knowledge, keeping it from the other inhabitants of the island. However, before meeting Luffy, he was unaware of the existence of rubber. He is also very perceptive and has an amazing deductive ability, quickly seeing through Robin's deception and concluding that the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell was not at Upper Yard but beyond it. Despite his hubris, Enels prediction that the survival game would end with himself, and four others turned out to be false, as he could not predict Luffy's survival inside Nola's stomach. He demonstrates rather good manipulative skills, utilizing Skypiean-Shandia tension from the previous 400 years of bloodshed (only recently halted by the peace progressions from the previous God, Gan Fall) to incite chaos and war, decimating both factions in the process and leaving little competition in his expeditions into Upper Yard and his eventual discovery of the Golden Belfry. As a result of his extensive studying of Upper Yard's ruins, Enel also has a deep understanding of the history, origins, and politics behind the 400-year-old conflict, and was fully willing to utilize said knowledge and information for personal goals. He also managed to outwit Nico Robin, who was the most intelligent member of the Straw Hat Pirates and a very skilled manipulator in her own right. He was able of design and build his signature weapon, the Nonosama Bo, a melee combat weapon made of gold that works together with his Devil Fruit powers, all by himself. Enel has melee combat skills without rely on his Devil Fruit powers. He has good acrobatic skills, which he uses to dodge attacks such as the shots of Wyper's bazooka and Zoro's sword attacks. He possesses incredible physical strength. He easily caught an out of placed giant gold gear of the Maxim ark and put it back with one hand. During his fight against Luffy, he was able of caught his two arms in midair during a Gatling Gun attack, by using Kenbushoku Haki, and slam Luffy's body against Ark Maxim's wooden deck through his stretched arms, breaking the wooden deck in the process. Enel has an above-average endurance, shrugging off most of Luffy's attacks. Enel had also stomped Zoro to the ground with his foot, and the ground shook as a result. Zoro would later comment that his strength was monstrous. During his Cover Story, he was able of defeat Seamars, an extraterrestrial pirate captain, with a single lightning-imbued kick. Enel appears to possess a vast knowledge of mechanics and technology. He personally designed his flying ark, Maxim, and knows its workings inside and out. If any damage is done to the inside, he is able to repair it. He was even able to design a storm cloud production system, an electrical power system, and a Jet Dial fail-safe for the ark, in the event that the main engines were damaged. In addition, he has some awareness of the meteorological aspects of the sky. Also, he has extensive knowledge on the multitude of Dials scattered across the Sky Islands. Enel ate the Goro Goro no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create, control, and transform his body into lightning. He can use a variety of lightning-based attacks, either by channeling lightning through his body or by striking the drums on his back. Its power is said to be invincible. He is able to attack his opponents with powerful bolts of lightning. He can freely control the power output he unleashes, up to a maximum of 200,000,000 volts. When amplified by his ship, his powers became strong enough to easily destroy an entire island. Enel can also use his power for transportation, he can move at the speed of lightning and travel through conductive materials. It can be used for medical purposes as well; in the event that he takes significant damage, he can use his electricity to restart his own heart. He can even use his powers to greatly enhance his mantra to near-omniscient levels by reading electric-signals in the air from afar. He is also capable of creatively using his Devil Fruit to raise the temperature of gold using electricity, and then manipulate and shape it using electromagnetism, allowing him to completely rebuild it into any shape he desires. Both his trident and personal flying ark were formed with this power. His mini-series suggests that he does not need to breathe, and can survive outside of the atmosphere. Enel wields a golden staff and is adept at using it, dealing powerful strikes to his opponents with it. Enel mostly uses it to bludgeon his opponents that he deems unworthy of dying at the hands of his electrical powers. He also used it extensively against the rubber bodied Luffy, when all electrical based attacks failed. He changed it into a trident with his metal-molding powers in order to spear the young pirate, as well as using the electricity to superheat the weapon in order to increase the damage inflicted. Enel is a extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, known as \"Mantra\" in the sky islands. His Haki is further enhanced by his Devil Fruit powers, making him virtually omniscient of the thoughts and actions of Skypiea. With enough skill, he can use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack that much easier to evade. This prediction appears to the user as an image or brief \"premonition\" of what the opponent will do in the user's mind-eye, and the damage the user will take if the attack actually \"hits\". Though the power allows the user to predict most attacks, it can be circumvented by various means. With the Goro Goro no Mi, Enel can pick up electromagnetic waves from the air, allowing him to overhear conversations and everything around him with extraordinary range: this has extended the range of his Mantra to cover roughly all of Skypiea. By comparison, most of the other priests could only keep track of people nearby. He cannot predict inherently random attacks, as Luffy managed to bypass Enel's Mantra by bouncing his punches off a nearby wall, to prevent himself and thus Enel from knowing where they would land. Enel failed to discern the presence of Luffy inside the giant snake Nola, only detecting him after he escaped. It also does not make the user any faster than normal, so the user's ability to dodge attacks is dependent on their physical speed; Enel was unable to avoid Luffy's finishing move because it was moving too fast. Even Enel himself admits that his Mantra is not perfect."},
{"name": "Emporio Ivankov", "episode": "Episode 537", "chapter": "Chapter 438", "year": 2009, "note": "He was first mentioned by Bentham in Chapter 532.", "appearance": "Ivankov is a large man with an afro of indigo hair, and has long eyelashes, he also has a noticeably odd-shaped chin resembling an arrowhead. His afro is large enough to hold people inside it. He has a personal Jolly Roger tattooed just below his chest. As an okama, he dresses in reddish-purple woman's leotard with a high collar and a deep V-neck that reaches down to his belly. He wears matching gloves and boots, as well as a pearl necklace. He wears a net cape on his back and matching net leggings. He also wears heavy, but tasteful makeup. To signify his queen-ship of New Kama Land, he wears a queen's crown with a king's crown on top. Using his Emporio Female Hormones on himself, Ivankov can become a large-sized, relatively curvy woman. This form is more realistically proportioned (relatively speaking) than his male form and is rather well endowed. Because of the clothes he wears as an Okama, this form is also scantily dressed. Despite the changes brought on by the hormones, however, he is still incredibly tall and is at least twice, if not three times the size of the Impel Down officer Sadi. While in a flashback as a Revolutionary, Iva has been seen wearing a cloak, and without the crown. In the anime, when Iva turns into a woman, he keeps his male voice, unlike the other characters who are changed by his powers, although his voice sounds slightly different between male and female.", "personality": "As an Okama, Iva is an effeminate cross-dressing man. He also has a tendency to put \"buru\" at the end of a sentence as well as pronounce \"watashi\" and \"anata\" with a v (vatashi and vanata). He also tends to sometimes proclaim the exact opposite of a statement he has just said, with people believing this is his sense of humor, such as saying that he would not mind being called \"Crap\", before hastily announcing that he would not be referred to as such. He is noted for not being picky on what Japanese honorific someone can use when addressing him. Being one who follows the way of the Okama, Iva strongly values friendship and bonds above all else. He seems to find great motivation at helping both friends and subordinates and is ready to put his life on the line for their sake, as seen when he flew into a rage against Kuma when the latter attacked his \"candies\". Due to this trait, Ivankov willingly saved Luffy and Bentham when they were on the verge of death after being touched by Luffy's selflessness and pleading to save Bentham. He also believes that people should be what they want to be whether it be a man, woman, or Okama. He is very loud and open, even perverse, about his ideals as well. He does not care about other people's objections to his views, as was seen when he even turned a man who tries to kill him into a woman, after the man (now woman) was embarrassed by his ordeal and had previously stated he objected to Ivankov's views. He states that as a prisoner of Impel Down, he is not such a good person as he would not save someone's life. However, when touched by the words of friendship and hope, he considers their life worth saving. He thinks that \"miracles\" only come to those who never give up and therefore should not be taken lightly of and nor should those who can muster within themselves to produce such also be looked down upon. He also dislikes people who rely on others to save them, and believes they are not worth being saved. According to him, he always questions the \"Will to Live\" of nations he saved. Additionally, he also seems to be perceptive, being able to tell a person's physical health condition after observing them for a short while; Ivankov's intelligence also extends to being able to estimate what \"toll\" his Devil Fruit power upon those he uses it on as well as noticing Dragon's habit of looking towards the East Blue when the wind blows, and correctly assumed it was because his family was there. Before his meeting with Luffy, he did not express interest in breaking out of prison. He stated that he will escape when Dragon and the revolutionaries would take down the World Government. However, when Ivankov learned that Luffy was Dragon's son, he decided to help Luffy rescue Ace, considering his duty to his \"personal compatriot\", Dragon. He has a hatred towards anyone who has forgotten him, claiming that no one could possibly forget his face. He also tends to call people by their name or nickname (or part of it) followed with \"boy\" (, bi?), like calling Mr. 2 Bon Kurei \"Bon-boy\", Luffy as \"Straw Hat-boy\", and Crocodile \"Croco-boy\". Iva often shouts \"Hee-Haw!\" (, Hh?); in the Shonen Jump translation, he shouts \"Woo-Hoo!\". Like other characters in One Piece, Ivankov has his own laughter style: Mmmfufufu (, nfufufu?).", "abilities_and_powers": "He is considered the greatest okama in the world. As queen of Kamabakka Kingdom, Iva controls an island of male transvestites, which gives him a similar status on par with Boa Hancock, who rules over Amazon Lily. In Impel Down, he set up his new kingdom (or queendom) called New Kama Land and commanded a small army of \"New Kama Okama\" followers, all of whom were former prisoners. Following the war, he returned to Kamabakka Kingdom along with his New Kama Land followers, uniting his 2 king/queendoms. As a commander of the Revolutionaries, Iva has control over the lower ranking members of the army. He appears to have considerable skills as a leader, evident by his ability to unite the rag-tag group of unruly inmates that strayed away and eventually found themselves in New Kama Land under his command. In contrast to his rather comical appearance, Ivankov is a powerful fighter should the need arise. His strength is great enough to allow him to fight on equal terms with the completely transformed Pacifista, Warlords of the Sea Bartholomew Kuma. He was able to easily defeat (without any visible damage) Sanji, one of the Straw Hats' top fighters. Upon encountering Crocodile in Impel Down, he also mentioned that he could defeat the former Warlord if necessary. Another helpful, if comical, asset Ivankov has is that he wears a great deal of make-up, enough to essentially create a \"mask\" which was able to completely shield his face from Magellan's corrosive poison and Akainu's magma in the anime, though in the latter case, it did not prevent him from getting hurt as he fainted soon afterwards. Ivankov also appears to have some knowledge regarding Haki, having asked Luffy about it at the final stages of the battle at Marineford, and the fact that he was able to retain his consciousness after Luffy unleashed a surge of Haoshoku Haki throughout Marineford (that incapacitated both Marine and pirate alike) despite being so close to the boy while running side by side with him suggests remarkable willpower on Ivankov's part. Ivankov has massive physical strength befitting his size. He can easily carry a normal-sized prison guard with only one hand while searching for Ace in Level 6 prison of Impel Down. With a single kick, he could knock Bartholomew Kuma away with great force despite the latter's cybernetic reinforced durability as a Pacifista without any strain on his leg whereas Sanji, who has fearsome kicking power ended up damaging his own leg when he attacked Kuma back at Thriller Bark. Despite his size, Ivankov is extremely fast with incredible agility. In the anime, Ivankov can effortlessly evade Magellan's poison attacks while playing around and also dodged Kuma's lasers while rotating at high speed. Even with an enlarged head, he can maneuver fast enough to create multiple afterimages of himself to use his Galaxy Wink technique. His agility can be further enhanced by transforming himself into a woman. As a woman, Ivankov has outstanding acrobatic prowess, able to perform extraordinary feats of somersaults, handsprings, and flips. He easily overwhelms Sadi in terms of speed, able to attack and evade with fluid mobility. Ivankov is also an extremely skilled and versatile martial artist. In addition to Newkama Kenpo, he is also an expert wrestler. He employed Newkama Kenpo techniques as a man and kicks and wrestling techniques as a woman. He easily defeated Chief Guard Sadi, one of the strongest among the staff of Impel Down, without any injuries. He also successfully injured Magellan before succumbing to his poison. He easily defeated Sanji, who is powerful enough to defeat monsters and dangerous enemies such as Jabra, an extremely powerful Rokushiki master. Ivankov has immense endurance, as he could stand in Level 5, also known as the Freezing Hell, without showing any signs of discomfort even though the temperature was so low that prisoners were losing their limbs from extreme frostbite. Enhanced with his hormones, he could survive exposure to Magellan's deadly poison and muster enough strength to launch himself to Level 2 while carrying Inazuma. He also recovered shortly after escaping from Impel Down. In the anime, he can defend against the full force of Sanji's Diable Jambe enhanced kicks with his arms crossed without any effort. Ivankov has incredible strength in his facial muscles, as he could easily create powerful shock waves with simple winks. Ivankov ate the Horu Horu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create a variety of special hormones that can alter the recipients body in any way he desires, effectively allowing him to \"remodel a human from the inside\". He can also turn his fingers into syringes, which he uses to inject the hormones into a targets body, including his own body if he desires. With this power, he can freely alter any of the recipient's physical aspects, including: sex, growth, skin pigment, stamina, emotions, and many other things. This power led him to be known as the \"Miracle Person\"; this is not accurate however, as Ivankov himself stated that his hormones are not a miracle cure all and can have potentially deadly side effects if overused. Ivankov can inject hormones into himself, granting him physical characteristics that are advantageous to him in combat; he can greatly enlarge the size of his head to greatly enhance the power of his signature Hell Wink technique, and he can transform himself into a woman, making his/her body soft and flexible, rendering him/her resistant to blunt force. He can also create adrenaline hormones that can give the recipient a power boost, allowing them to continue fighting even if they are exhausted. He can also create hormones that enhance the recipient's natural immune system, allowing him to boost a person's chances of survival from conditions that would otherwise mean certain death, such as disease and poisoning. However, the chance of survival is only slightly increased, the healing hormone cure is extremely painful, and the process takes many hours, or even a few days to complete, so only those with strong enough willpower can recover. Also, the process shortens a person's potential lifespan, by years if the condition was serious enough. Ivankov is an extremely powerful grandmaster of a martial art called the Newkama Kenpo. Ivankov could injure Chief Warden Magellan before losing to his poison ability and during the Marineford War, Ivankov was practically the first (and probably the only one) to actually harm Kuma throughout the extent of the battle. In the anime, he easily overpowered and defeated Sanji, a powerful master of the Black Leg Style. Ivankov's trademark technique is the Death Wink. This ridiculous but powerful attack creates a massive shockwave simply by winking. He demonstrated this wink on a man who swore revenge on him because Ivankov had turned his father, who was a king, into a woman. The man fired with his bazooka and Ivankov used the Death Wink to repel the blast. His Death Wink is powerful enough to shatter steel traps. This attack is often powered up by Ivankov's Devil Fruit, using it to increase the size of his own head, creating the more powerful Hell Wink."},

{"name": "Edward Weevil", "episode": "Episode 802", "chapter": "Chapter 751", "year": 2015, "note": "He was first mentioned by Brannew in Chapter 700. He appeared as a silhouette in Chapter 801.", "appearance": "Weevil has a stocky figure, with prominent scars going down his left eye, across his neck and around his left arm. He has bushy blond hair with two braids coming down either side of his face and similar to his self-proclaimed father, has a black bandanna and white crescent-shaped mustache which is thinner and even longer than Edward Newgate's. His legs are disproportionately small for his build and his nose also appears to be perpetually runny, evocative of his simple-minded nature. He wears overalls that are hung by chains rather than straps and bear his personal jolly roger on them. Incidentally, from behind, his appearance is similar to that of Oars or Little Oars Jr., with his large build, thick mane of hair, and his exaggeratedly long mustache which (from behind) resembles horns. They even share jagged teeth, square jaw and a scar running down the left side of their face, as well as stick-like legs in comparison to the rest of their bodies.", "personality": "Edward Weevil is a violent man as he left destruction in his wake when hunting Whitebeard's crew and allies. He is not very intelligent, shown by the fact he had a hard time telling the difference between a mirror and a photograph (even though the only similarity is the mustache). As a result, he is constantly manipulated by his mother, making him believe that he is the rightful heir of the Whitebeard Pirates' fortune, not the members of the Whitebeard Pirates, to whom he believed (influenced by his mother) are unworthy. He also talks in a whiny, snot-nosed manner, making him sound both infantile and highly unintelligent. Though his claims are widely doubted, at the very least he seems to genuinely believe them to be true. Unlike his alleged father, Weevil does not hold concepts of family in the same regard, believing that his alleged blood heritage is what makes him true family, not bonds built on friendship and camaraderie. Because of this, he violently attacked all those once affiliated with Whitebeard. Regardless, he was shown to have protected Whitebeard's hometown Sphinx. He also holds grudges, as he wanted to avenge his alleged father's death upon Blackbeard, but was convinced by his mother that revenge is not important. Despite his destructive behavior, Weevil is shown to be honorable when he saved Sphinx and its inhabitants from the Marines since it was the native home of his alleged father.", "abilities_and_powers": "Weevil's powers have been praised by Borsalino who compared his abilities to that of a younger Whitebeard, his alleged father. He was able to single-handedly defeat 16 pirate crews affiliated with Whitebeard, including the A O Pirates. When the Marines attempted to arrest Weevil after the Seven Warlord was abolished, Weevil completely wiped out the all the Marines sent to capture him. When he later appeared on Sphinx to protect it, the Marines there quickly retreated in fear of the former Warlords power. While he was no match for Admiral Ryokugyu, he at least survived the brutal Admirals attack. Like his alleged father Whitebeard, Weevil wields a naginata as a weapon of choice. Weevil possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Edward Newgate", "episode": "Episode 234", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "He was first mentioned by Smoker in Chapter 157. Better known by his epithet Whitebeard.", "appearance": "In his younger days, Newgate wore an open dark gray vest and a black bandanna, and his trademark mustache was nonexistent. Later in his life, he grew the prominent crescent-shaped mustache, which would spawn his epithet, \"Whitebeard\". When he was 52, he wore a white and yellow pirate hat with his jolly roger on it over a black bandana with black and red, both worn over long, blond flowing hair he had back then. Whitebeard was an abnormally large man, with a height of 666cm (21'10\"). Unlike other large-sized humans, however, he was well-proportioned. He had a long face, ploughed because of the advanced age with many wrinkles around his eyes, and many scars running along his chest, and was very muscular. The muscles on his biceps seemed to grow bigger whenever he used his quake-based powers. Like all of his men, he had his own Jolly Roger tattooed on his back. In the manga, his eyes are brown, but in the anime, his eye color is seen to be yellow. He wore a black bandanna around his head and adorned himself with a white captain's coat, which hung loosely from his broad shoulders and bore his Jolly Roger symbol. He was always seen bare-chested, and wore light, loose pants tucked inside his large black boots, and a dark pirate sash around his waist. While not in battle, Whitebeard was typically on oxygen and attached to several medical sensor machines, due to health issues concerning his age. In the manga, after Akainu melted off a portion of his head, Whitebeard lost his left eye and the left side of his mustache (this was changed to just losing the left side of his mustache in the anime) as well as a massive hole in his torso (a second, bigger hole in the stomach was also dealt by Akainu in the anime). However, for the entire 72 years that he lived, he had never once received a wound on his back because he never ran away from his battles. As a child, he wore a light-colored sleeveless shirt with the word \"Power\" (, Chikara?) written on it. He also wore shorts and a white bandanna. He had bandaged scrapes and cuts from his fights.", "personality": "Edward Newgate was a cheerful and carefree person during his younger years, prior to commanding his own ship and becoming known as Whitebeard. Due to being an orphan who grew up in poverty, Newgate had a strong desire for a family, which he saw as the greatest treasure one could have. Despite his peers considering this to be strange and humorous, Newgate was never ashamed of this wish. His reign on the sea, reputation, and foreboding power made him seemingly overconfident and fearless. In initial appearances, he seemed unable to see any cause for alarm on any decision he made and refused all advice given to him, such as his nurse telling him not to drink heavily or Shanks warning him of Blackbeard. However, he was much more thoughtful than he initially appeared to be. Actions that initially seemed to be the result of thoughtless, headstrong bravado actually had strong reasons behind them; his loud declaration that Fish-Man Island belonged to him freed the island from all invading pirates and slavery, and his insistence that Blackbeard be punished was merely a cover for Ace, who had set out after him against Whitebeard's wishes. Though he may seem to have an overgrown ego, Whitebeard knew deep down that he was nothing but a single man and was fully aware of his own mortality. He knew that the youth were the keys to the future, and that their lives were far more important than his own. Because of this, he was not afraid of sacrificing himself for the safety of those he considered his children. Like Gol D. Roger, Whitebeard believed that a child should not be responsible for their parents' sins. Yet another belief he held is that any path a man wished to follow in life was fine by him, as long as they did not regret it. Despite his fierce reputation, Whitebeard was a compassionate man, having adopted countless people of different backgrounds into his crew as his foster children, such as Squard, whose life was devastated by Roger killing his crew, or Teach, who requested to join his crew due to being homeless. Marco stated that the main reason the Whitebeard Pirates held such strong loyalty to their captain was due to Newgate's paternal-like attitude, deeply caring for them like a father. Contrary to the tyrannical Kaidou and Charlotte Linlin, Whitebeard used his power and influence as one of the Four Emperors for humanitarian purposes. He liberated and protected Fish-Man Island from slavery, an act which touched the hearts of the normally human-distrusting citizens of Ryugu Kingdom and invested the majority of his riches to support his homeland of Sphinx, an once poor, lawless island. Whitebeard was understanding and forgiving of his subordinates, going to great lengths to rescue any who were in great danger, no matter the cost. Whitebeard was naturally protective of his family and did not tolerate the idea of letting a crewmate join someone else's crew, especially a rival one. In fact, the notion of separating himself from just one of them and for a short time infuriated him. Even if he did accept doing so, it was reluctantly and while showing much annoyance. Whitebeard was very careful about choosing a person to be included in his crew, depending on their personality and nature. This cautiousness mainly stemmed from his time as a member of the Rocks Pirates, as the violent and poor relationship among the members of that crew left a negative impact on Whitebeard. For this reason, Whitebeard was fully against letting someone like Kozuki Oden join his crew, since the Samurai was rebellious by nature. Still, Whitebeard showed enough open-mindedness to give Oden a chance to prove himself in a challenge and eventually allowed the Kuri daimyo to be part of his crew after the latter prioritized the life of an innocent woman over the challenge itself. Also, while he held reserves regarding Marshall D. Teach, he nevertheless allowed the boy to join his crew for being an orphan with nowhere else to go; this turned out to be a mistake that Whitebeard would come to regret. A distinguishing feature of Whitebeard's nature was his high moral standards: he never forgave the death of a crewmate by another and believed that a man could not live without some form of honor code. When confronted by Blackbeard, he intended to avenge Thatch, despite being close to death at the time. However, he was willing to go against his personal code under certain circumstances, if he felt the risk would not be worth the safety of his crew. Whitebeard seemed to enjoy talking about the past; when Shanks visited his ship, the first thing Newgate did was recollect his memories from the last twenty-two years, particularly those involving old rivals like Roger, Garp and Sengoku. People that were children at that time were still viewed as children in Whitebeard's eyes, no matter how powerful they had grown since. Despite fond memories of his time as a pirate captain, Whitebeard was not proud of his former association with the Rocks Pirates due to the lack of camaraderie among members, thus he rarely referred to those times unless in a negative tone. Regardless of his poor health at the time, Whitebeard liked drinking, to the point that bringing and sharing a drink with him (preferably of high quality and very expensive) was viewed as enough of a respectful gesture to engage a conversation. This was seen in his encounters with Shanks, Gol D. Roger, and Shiki; still, this did not guarantee complete cooperation from him, judging from the nature of these conversations. Like other characters in One Piece, he had a unique laugh, which was \"Gu ra ra ra ra\". Like Perona, his laugh is similar to the name of his Devil Fruit, the Gura Gura no Mi. However, in the anime (before the Marineford Arc) and Gigant Battle, his laugh was changed to a regular \"Ha ha ha ha ha\". In the American Shonen Jump, his laugh is changed to \"Gu ha ha ha ha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Whitebeard was one of the most powerful pirates in history. In his prime, he was one of the few able to take on the Pirate King Gol D. Roger, battling him for days to a draw. Due to his incredible strength, he was already feared as the \"Strongest Man in the World\", before Roger's death and the start of Great Age of Pirates. After Roger's death, Whitebeard became one of the Four Emperors, the four most powerful pirates in the world and the rulers of the New World. In fact, among them, he was considered the \"Closest Man to One Piece\", and the ruler of the sea who stood before the \"throne\" and the title of Pirate King. As a testament to this, Whitebeard held not only the highest bounty among his peers, but the second highest in recorded history, at over 5 billion (only behind Roger's own). Kaidou, who is renowned as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", put Whitebeard in the same elite class as other legendary pirates, that actually possess the strength to stand against him in battle, such as Roger, Kozuzki Oden, Shanks, and their former captain. Even in his old age, he was able to effortlessly defeat Ace over a hundred times, even once while he was sleeping. During the Summit War of Marineford, Newgate's health was declining at a rapid rate due to his refusal to go into battle with life support and medication, despite this, he was able to engage in combat with Aokiji, Kizaru, and Akainu on even terms. After Akainu killed Ace, Whitebeard brutally injured the Admiral in retaliation, with the latter being practically helpless in response to Whitebeard's power, temporarily defeating him in a relatively short battle with a mere two hits, causing immense destruction all around. Whitebeard's reputation alone made his simple declaration of Fish-Man Island being his territory enough to keep slave traders and pirates from attacking the island further, making Whitebeard himself far more effective than the treaty signed with the World Government 200 years before his death. People from every ocean were aware of the Emperor's power and seemingly believed that he could end the world if he so wished. Few would dare to challenge him or any of his crew, which makes Ace, Crocodile, Aokiji, Akainu, Blackbeard, Kaidou, and Luffy very brave and powerful people, for just trying. After his death, the entire world fell into chaos: with total victory declared for the Marines and all of Whitebeard's territories no longer considered dangerous (despite the fact that his crew was still alive). As a true testament to his strength and reputation, the World Government was prepared to use practically the entire Marine force and the Seven Warlords of the Sea to fight Newgate and his crew, with Sengoku even remarking that their victory was not guaranteed due to Whitebeard's overwhelming power. Whitebeard was given the title of the \"strongest man in the world\" for his physical power, which is far superior to even a giant. During the Summit War of Marineford, Whitebeard completely overpowered vast numbers of strong Marine officers and giants with tremendous physical might, such as Vice Admiral Lonz, with only one hand and supplemented by his Devil Fruit powers. Whitebeard blocked a two-handed downward swing from the giant Vice Admiral John Giant with only one hand on his naginata, extinguished the flames of one of Akainu's molten rocks with just a single breath, and prevented a massive paddle ship from advancing using only one hand. He could jump to great heights to attack large opponents, such as John Giant. In his prime, Newgate was capable of fighting Roger to a standstill in a battle that lasted 3 days and 3 nights. Despite his gigantic size, Whitebeard could move at considerable speeds, having appeared behind Akainu to attack him in a matter of seconds, with the latter (who was on his way to kill Luffy) only realizing it once his soldiers yelled at him to watch out. Whitebeard appeared to have debilitating health problems, possibly stemming from his advanced age and excessive drinking. When not in battle, he was always surrounded by nurses, used oxygen tubes, and was hooked up to intravenous tubes and life support systems; despite this, he used to literally drink sake by the barrel. However, Marco noted that Whitebeard's health had gotten worse, and he no longer possessed the reflexes to avoid Squard's surprise attack, which was, in the past, something easy for him to achieve. Even with his health issues, Whitebeard was still considered the world's most dangerous and powerful pirate. Whitebeard's physical resistance and pain tolerance were tremendous: he was able to keep fighting despite the number of life-threatening injuries he sustained, which included part of his head being burned off. This also proves that Whitebeard possessed enormous amounts of stamina and endurance; no matter how much damage he took throughout the battle, Whitebeard continued to press forward and fight, only stopping once almost all of the Blackbeard Pirates collectively shot and brutally stabbed him to death at point-blank range. It was shown that even in his old age, in a heavily wounded state and without access to his Devil Fruit and Haki powers, he could near-effortlessly take down a Warlord of the Sea, as demonstrated in his fight against Blackbeard. During the Summit War, Whitebeard sustained 267 sword wounds, 152 gunshot wounds, and 46 wounds from cannonballs, and got a portion of his head blasted off, resulting in 465 injuries in total. In addition, he received one of Kizaru's laser beams and two of Akainu's magma blasts. Whitebeard also received a brutal assault from the Blackbeard Pirates. However, even after taking so much damage in his already weakened state, he died standing, an impressive feat when compared to other characters. Even Teach was shocked by Whitebeard's tenacity. Besides his formidable power, Whitebeard was a brilliant leader and an incredibly skilled military strategist: a match for former Fleet Admiral Sengoku, one renowned as \"The Resourceful General\" for his famed acumen on the field of battle. The Emperor's tactical prowess was demonstrated when he saw through Sengoku's deliberate leak of information regarding a change of schedule for Ace's execution, and when he foresaw the Pacifista's arrival at Marineford and scattered the pirates so that they would not be routed by the cyborgs. In addition, Whitebeard could easily adapt to rapidly changing situations even in the heat of battle, as shown when he bypassed a siege wall impervious to his Devil Fruit powers by having Oars, who was in a near-death state, help carry the paddle ship into the Marineford plaza. Even when he was on the brink of death, Whitebeard quickly thought of a countermeasure against Teach's Devil Fruit power's nullification abilities by using his naginata to cut Teach down, taking him off guard for him to use his quake powers to injure him. Whitebeard ate the Gura Gura no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to cause quakes and generate powerful shockwaves. This power is considered to be the strongest Devil Fruit power within the Paramecia class. According to Sengoku, Whitebeard had the power to destroy the world. He had the power to send incredibly powerful shockwaves through the air, creating cracks in the air itself in the process. These shockwaves possess devastating offensive might, being able to clash evenly with the Magu Magu no Mi, the Devil Fruit with the highest attack power out of all the Devil Fruits. He could use these shockwaves to quickly take down multiple enemies over a widespread area or take down a single target with terrifying effectiveness, even Giants. He could also use his shockwaves defensively, as their vast raw power could easily stop incoming attacks. He could also generate strong vibrations from his body that could easily shatter ice. He could use his power to shake, rupture, and tilt the landscape itself. By striking at the general area with his quake powers, he could cause large earthquakes and, under the right circumstances, massive tsunamis. His quakes would cause serious damage and alterations to the surrounding landscape, destroying buildings, creating large crevices in the ground, and pushing up fragments of the ground into new rock formations. He could even \"grab\" the surrounding area itself and tilt it, described as making the entire sea tilt. Whitebeard could use his power to enhance his physical attacks by surrounding his hands and feet with concentrated quake bubbles. These quake bubbles would release a small but powerful shockwave on impact, greatly increasing the destructive power of his melee attacks. He could also surround the blade of his polearm with a quake bubble, greatly increasing its destructive power as well. Soon after Whitebeard's death, his power was stolen by Blackbeard through unknown means. Whitebeard was one of the very few people in the world who could use all three types of Haki. Whitebeard possessed immense mastery in the usage of Haoshoku Haki. During his initial encounter with Kozuki Oden 30 years ago, their sudden clash created a notable effect similar to lightning and released a large burst. His Haoshoku Haki was displayed to a far greater extent against his longtime rival, Gol D. Roger, as their clashing Haoshoku Haki cracked the air, creating an effect akin to lightning and generating a shock wave that blew back everything and everyone on and near the island. Most notably, Newgate was one of the few people able to \"infuse\" his attacks with Haoshoku Haki, which exponentially increased his attack power, with his naginata being shown emitting streams of black lightning-like energy which caused their clash to disperse the clouds nearby. Another example was his clash with Shanks which resulted in the heavens being split in two. During the Summit War, he was on the verge of using Haoshoku Haki against some of the World Government's executioners to protect Portgas D. Ace but failed because of a sudden illness attack. He is capable of using this form of Haki in the video games One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2, 3 and 4 as well as One Piece: Burning Blood. Whitebeard was an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, which he could imbue his weapon Murakumogiri with. Two decades ago in his prime, he was shown clashing evenly with the samurai Kozuki Oden who was a powerful Busoshoku Haki user in his own right. Whitebeard could also utilize the advanced technique of projecting Haki out from his blade; this was shown during his fight with Roger where the duo's weapons met in a powerful clash without even making contact. In the anime, when Whitebeard uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a red-colored flowing aura. Due to his age and worsening health, it was not as powerful compared to his prime, but he could still negate the intangibility of Logia-based Devil Fruits. In the past, he was able to defeat Crocodile (though it is unknown if the former Warlord of the Sea had eaten his Devil Fruit by that point). During the Summit War, Whitebeard successfully inflicted significant damage on Akainu, whereas Marco, Vista, and Jinbehighly skilled Busoshoku Haki users themselvesfailed to do so. Whitebeard was an extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki. It was first shown 30 years prior after both he and the Whitebeard Pirates shipwrecked in Wano, as he could sense Oden coming from a vast distance towards them, and his overall strength. He was even able to sense and counter Ace (when he was still new on the ship and was attempting to kill Newgate) while sleeping. In the bay of Marineford, he predicted Crocodile's sudden attack but did not move, knowing that Luffy would block it. However, due to both his age and worsening health, he failed to predict Squard's betrayal and thus got injured, something which, according to Marco, was totally unexpected from the Emperor. Whitebeard wielded a gigantic naginata called Murakumogiri, one of the 12 Supreme Grade Blades. He was immensely skilled with the blade even in old age. He could use Murakumogiri to fight off countless powerful Marines in Marineford, including Marine Admirals, and during his prime, he also clashed with Kozuki Oden who was one of the strongest samurais of Wano. When he was a child, he had a much smaller and less well-crafted spear made up of a simple knife bound to a pole."},

When in the arena, he wears gold boxing gloves.", "personality": "Elizabello II apparently likes combat and has earned the nickname \"Fighting King\" for it. He seems to be very proud and arrogant as he stated that the formation formed during the Corrida Colosseum B Block match was to protect the other gladiators from him and not the other way around. However, given the destructive capabilities of his King Punch, these words were hardly empty, being more realistic than arrogant. He seemed very much unfazed when he was defeated, simply stating that he had done his part. He is quite prideful as he was annoyed when Zoro referred to him as 'the king of somewhere or other' due to forgetting the name of Prodence. Additionally, he was further aggravated when he used his full power King Punch only to blow away the rubble from Pica's stone statue form after Zoro sliced it apart. His reason for his intense training is so he can be powerful enough to protect his people. He also wishes to form peaceful and friendly relationships with other countries. Elizabello has also a strong sense of honor and gratitude, which was shown when he decided to fight Doflamingo to honor his debt towards Riku Doldo III and Usopp.", "abilities_and_powers": "As king of his kingdom he should have full rule over it and its inhabitants. Elizabello has tremendous physical strength. According to Dagama, Elizabello is a natural born weapon of mass destruction due to his monstrous physical power. Elizabello's punches can easily create shock waves powerful enough to shatter a large amount of stone as shown when he could shatter the arm of Pica's gigantic golem with Chinjao. After an hour of warm up, Elizabello is at his strongest and can demolish an entire fortress with a single smash. Elizabello is also an extremely skilled expert boxer. He has great dexterity in using both arms to throw punches at high speed supplemented by his strength. In the anime, Elizabello can easily bring down a large number of Donquixote Pirates' subordinates with a barrage of rapid punches. When the move was executed at the Corrida Colosseum, its power was so immense that it lit up the entire stadium with its force, sending a powerful shockwave across the area and shattering the arena. The move can also be fired at such a great speed that not even the very agile Blue Gilly, was able to land his strike before Elizabello threw his. The punch was indeed so powerful that nearly all the remaining combatants, including Bellamy and Blue Gilly, were instantly defeated; only Bartolomeo remained unharmed due to his Bari Bari no Mi defense, and were it not for his barrier, the punch would have blown away the audience behind him as well."},

Du Feld is also greedy and unscrupulous, as he attempted to steal the treasure within the Tamatebako when given the opportunity despite it belonging to Big Mom.

{"name": "Duval", "episode": "Episode 491", "chapter": "Chapter 386", "year": 2008, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 492.", "appearance": "Duval is a very large man who was originally introduced wearing a large mask, with long red tufts attached to it, giving him his epithet Iron Mask Duval. While standing, he appears around two and a half times a normal person's height. He has a muscular torso, but has skinny arms and legs. Besides his head and shoulders which are covered in armor, he wears an open leather jacket, black pants, cowboy boots, and a long fur cape. Underneath his iron mask, Duval surprisingly looked exactly like Sanji's first wanted poster. Except for his eyebrow, which swirls downward instead of upward like Sanji's, he was an exact duplicate of the drawing. Because of this appearance, he had a lot of trouble with the Marines and bounty hunters, and thus had to conceal his face in order to protect himself. Duval received a lot of injuries because of this; his most devastating one is a scar on his back, which he states is very painful. He had this exact face since he was born, and even made his parents think he was an ugly baby due to the dawn of the Golden Age of Pirates. Upon confronting Sanji in order to get revenge, Duval got his entire facial structure rearranged by Sanji's kicks. The result of such a crude and violent operation was a complete successful makeover. Due to Sanji's kicks, Duval's entire face had been rearranged into a handsome one almost completely different from the one he originally had (his only leftover features are very tiny spirals still visible on the ends of his eyebrows). He absolutely loves it for the benefits it gives. Though turned handsome, Duval however has a hard time winking and thus his eyes would often not blink in unison. This might also be because he's never had to wink before, as implied by Sanji. Pleased with his new appearance, Duval's been calling himself \"Handsome\".", "personality": "In order to protect himself from the countless bounty hunters and Marines who mistook him for Sanji when the bounty poster came out, Duval decided to hide his face behind an iron mask. Having been scarred both physically and emotionally from his pursuers and the fact that he could no longer go out in broad daylight without having to conceal himself, Duval felt that a great injustice was dealt to him by Sanji. He felt that Sanji dealt a great wound to him and that the cook had stolen his life. Since then Duval developed a deep grudge against the Straw Hats and vowed to have his revenge for his unfortunate tragedy. Duval's hatred for Sanji is so strong that any mention of him drives Duval absolutely ballistic and will cause Duval to rant about his hatred and planned revenge for Sanji until he is calmed down. He becomes so emotional at the matter that it creates quite a scene. Also while Duval talks normally most of the time, whenever he gets angry at the mention of Sanji, his \"accent\" comes out. His accent resembles a type of Japanese accent which when translated can be akin to that used by country folk. This accent is so different than the one he uses when he talks calmly that everyone, even his men and the Macro Pirates, notice it. He had his accent from birth, even when he was just crying and was unable to talk yet. He is also rather slow as the entire time he held a grudge against Sanji he never thought of simply changing his own appearance (even giving a \"why didn't I think of that\" look and pose when this was angrily pointed out by Sanji). Duval nursed this deep hatred against Sanji until the chef rearranged his face with a barrage of kicks. Upon waking up from Sanji's operation on his face and seeing the results, Duval instantly loved the work. Not only did this new face mean that he would no longer be chased but it was also extremely handsome. Because of this, his entire outlook on life changed for the positive and all his past grudges were washed away. Unfortunately for people because of this face, he also became extremely vain and narcissistic. He became so narcissistic, that he would say \"handsome\" instead of his name in some sentences such as in, \"Wait up, it's me handsome\" or \"Hello, I'm handsome,\" and even has his gang refer to him as Handsome. After considering the Straw Hat pirates as friends, he always does his best to assist them whenever they need help such as locating Camie after she was kidnapped and guarding the Thousand Sunny with great vigilance against anyone who attempts to steal it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Duval has incredible strength as he was capable of crushing bundles of his metal harpoons with a single hand. Duval is a highly skilled fighter as he managed to survive being hunted down by powerful Marines and infamous bounty hunters. He beat up Peterman, a large man and the head of the Hound Pets with great ease and when defending the Thousand Sunny, he kicked away three of the Coffee Monkeys easily with a single kick. For two whole years, he managed to protect the Thousand Sunny from the Marines alongside the Rosy Life Riders, Hatchan, and Bartholomew Kuma. He is not as skilled as Sanji, having been felled by the latter in an instant after Duval challenged him in a one-on-one fight. He is highly experienced in the art of kidnapping, despite not wanting to be in the profession in the first place, and he along with his group rely on heavily coordinated attacks to subdue otherwise powerful foes that they could not overcome on their own. As part of having worked as a slaver, he is also knowledgeable about how human auctioning operates in the Sabaody Archipelago. While his men typically ride giant Flying Fish, Duval in particular rides a large bison called Motobaro. Duval typically uses harpoon guns for combat. Two types of harpoon guns in his arsenal are a small one that resembles a rifle and a large one that resembles a hand held multiple rocket launcher. Harpoons apparently can be loaded up to the small rifle shaped harpoon gun easily and the weapon is capable of storing and firing four rounds at the same time. The rocket launcher shaped harpoon gun, on the other hand, requires large magazines containing several harpoons in order to be loaded up, but is capable of firing all of them at the same time to create a deadlier barrage than the smaller rifle shaped one. Duval's harpoons are named \"Scorpion's Poison harpoons\", and are unsurprisingly coated with the eponymous poison, as their name implies. The poison coated on the harpoons is so potent that it can kill their target within three minutes, as well as highly corrosive it could cause steam to rise from a ship constructed from Adam Tree wood upon contact. He stores his harpoons in a quiver on his left hip."},

When he is in a weakened state, the sides of his head tend to sag. His mouth is full of sharp, triangular teeth and has thick purple colored lips. His chest is wide and his arms very large, with extremely prominent, round forearms, his hands and thin legs being quite small in comparison. He has light blue skin, and long, wavy, light-pink hair reaching down to his shoulders and to the dorsal fin he has on top of his back; as a Fish-Man, he has gills on his large neck.

Even though Dosun knows well that Hody will not hesitate to throw away his comrades, he continues to support his captain. He has a habit of saying \"Dosun\" often while talking. He also says different words depending on his energy level, \"dosun\" being him at his normal energy level. His exclamations at the end of his sentences altering from his lowest to highest \"power level\" are: When running low on power, his usual demeanor shifts into a more melancholic one that can be regressed by administering Energy Steroids to Dosun.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Dosun has command over lower-ranking members of the crew. Being a Fish-Man, he is at least ten times stronger than an average human, and even more in water; though, as a high-ranking member of the crew and a shark Fish-Man, and because of his size, he might be even stronger than that. However, after the negative effects of the Energy Steroids took effect, he became weak and old, stripping him of all his strength. Dosun's main choice of weapon is an enormous hammer with a curved head, and with the steroids boosting his strength, he can smash a building clean off its foundation with one swing. The hammer was later destroyed by Chopper in his Monster Point. Dosun consumed Energy Steroids to regain his strength and break the steel chains that Fukaboshi used to tie him, and gained enough strength to smash a building off the ground. He later consumes more pills again in order to fight against the Ryugu Kingdom's princes, who are crowned the strongest fighters in the entire kingdom. The drug grants the user double strength per pill, but shaves off a portion of their lifespan. This also had another side effect of making him old and weak after he was arrested, which lost him the strength he naturally had."},

He appeared slimmer and his hair appeared more angular. His face had facial hair, and his eyes appeared more blackish. He wore a simple, light purple collared shirt underneath his protective suit.", "personality": "Ten years ago, Mjosgard acted like most other World Nobles, considering himself to be a god who could do whatever he liked and who could get whatever he wanted from those of lesser status. He looked down on anyone who did not share his status, particularly non-humans like fish-men and merfolk. Although his family's fish-man slaves had been freed due to a legal agreement, Mjosgard wished to get them back due to the money he had spent on them and believed he was entitled to reclaim them. Notably, he was willing to personally go all the way to Fish-Man Island to seize them, though clearly did so believing he was invincible and not knowing the dangers of the deep sea. Even when the rest of his crew was killed and he was gravely injured, Mjosgard still expected that his slaves would return and the fish-men would give him the medical help he needed. When he finally realized that his former slaves could take revenge on him with no consequences, Mjosgard became extremely fearful and panicked, but remained unrepentant and antagonistic. Despite Otohime saving his life, Mjosgard was ungrateful and even attempted to shoot her at first; when his life was eventually saved by the fish-men, he promised to retaliate against his former slaves for their willingness to kill him. However, after Otohime accompanied him to Mary Geoise, her words eventually caused Mjosgard to have a change of heart and develop a debt of gratitude toward her for saving his life. He ceased owning slaves, and showed disgust at his past actions as well as attitudes and actions from other World Nobles that resembled the ones he used to have. When Otohime's family came up to Mary Geoise for the Levely, Mjosgard aligned with their interests over those of the World Nobles, to the point of even assaulting Saint Charlos to protect them and promising to claim responsibility for further retaliation, despite such defection ultimately resulting in a death sentence for him. However, Mjosgard was strategic in his plotting to protect his merfolk allies, as he barred members of the Neptune Family from attacking World Nobles in order to keep them safe under the law, instead seeking help from lawless pirates.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, Mjosgard was entitled by birthright to act as he pleased with the full backing of the World Government behind him, in particular having the ability to summon a Marine Admiral if attacked. However, he pushed this authority to the limit when he crashed on Fish-Man Island alone, as he soon found himself to be helpless in a remote area where no one would say anything should he be killed and go missing. Mjosgard was the only person on his ship who managed to survive after being attacked by creatures on the Sea Floor, though was gravely wounded and would have died without receiving medical attention. During his trip to Fish-Man Island, Mjosgard wielded a flintlock which he used to threaten the populace and attempt to kill Queen Otohime after she saved his life. During the most recent Levely, he used a large studded club to strike Charlos, with enough force to knock out the World Noble and give him gruesome injuries."},
{"name": "Donquixote Homing", "episode": "Episode 763", "chapter": "Chapter 699", "year": 2014, "note": "", "appearance": "Homing was a tall man, with dark blonde curly hair which reached to his shoulders, styled in the traditional way of the Celestial Dragons. He sported an impressive mustache, and, unlike his amoral brethren, possessed remarkably kind facial features and a rather thin face. He wore the typical garb of a World Noble during his tenure at Mary Geoise: a thick white suit with medal-like knobs on it, and a blue collar. After renouncing his status, Homing lowered his hair from the World Noble style, and switched to ordinary fine clothes, consisting a simple cyan dress shirt, dark pants with a light green cravat. His garments became increasingly tattered and dirty whilst living on the run in the North Blue.", "personality": "Unlike the typical World Nobles, Homing did not show any sign of arrogance or cruelty and viewed himself as a human being, like all normal people. He was humble as well as extremely kind and wished to live an ordinary life among commoners. Because of his great benevolence, he was seen as peculiar for a Celestial Dragon, and his compatriots even condemned him for being blasphemous for equaling himself with the rest of humanity; Homing took no offense in their insults and calmly brushed them off. However, after experiencing discrimination by angry victims of the World Nobles, he realized that he was nave as he had no prior knowledge of the hatred and resentment commoners had towards World Nobles. Despite his pampered past, he was at least appreciative of even the most minor opportunities for his family's safety, as when they found a relatively safe hideout in the junkyard, he felt relieved despite the insect infestations that Doflamingo alone complained about. Homing was willing to owe up to his own mistake by pleading the Celestial Dragons to rescue just his wife and sons, showing he was prepared to be left behind to reap what he sowed as long as his family remained safe. Notably, his speech pattern did not include \"eh\" at the end of his sentences, which is common among Celestial Dragons. He was extremely protective of his family and loved them very much. He showed signs of courage as he put himself in harm's way in order to protect his sons, and pleaded the angry mob to spare them. Before Doflamingo killed him, he apologized to his sons for failing them as a father.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, he could do as he pleased, without facing any legal consequences. He had tremendous political power and possessed the right to summon a Marine Admiral should he be attacked or think of someone as a threat. He was extremely wealthy and exerted huge political influence over the entire world, surpassing any royal members from the Levely. When he resigned from his position as a World Noble, he lost all of the above privileges and resources. Although Homing was given a manor and funds to start his new life, he lost it all overnight when a violent mob burned down his house and pursued his family in a bid for revenge against the Celestial Dragons' past actions. Coupled with his pampered past and lack of knowledge of prejudice that commoners have towards his heritage and the loss of the World Government's protection, Homing had a difficult time surviving in the North Blue, barely able to gather food to keep himself and sons alive, and watching helplessly as his wife died. Evidently, Homing did not bring any weapons with him, as the family was utterly defenseless towards the vicious torturers."},
{"name": "Dracule Mihawk", "episode": "Episode 49", "chapter": "Chapter 23", "year": 1998, "note": "He was first mentioned by Gin in Chapter 48 under his epithet. He was formally introduced in Chapter 50.", "appearance": "Mihawk is a tall, lean, and muscular man with black hair, a short beard, mustache and sideburns that point upwards. His nickname comes from his strangely colored red eyes (yellow in the anime), which resemble a hawk's eyes. Mihawk wears black and red ornate clothing with a crucifix pendant that hides a little dagger, which gives him the appearance of a Spanish swordsman. His attire consists of a wide-brimmed black hat decorated with a large plume, and a long, open black coat with a red velvet inside with no shirt underneath, with red, flower-patterned sleeves and collar. He wears white (light purple in the anime) pants held up by a decorated belt and tucked inside overly large boots in comparison to his leg size. Mihawk wears a kogatana around his neck, appearing as a golden cross-shaped necklace which is a dagger which looks identical to its larger counterpart Yoru, and carries his sword Yoru on his back when he is not using it. At his home in Kuraigana Island's castle, Mihawk sports different pants and an open white shirt with a ruffled neck. When he met up with Zoro outside, he had a plain dark cloak draped over his shoulders. After the timeskip, Mihawk shows some more wrinkles near the eyes. While reading about the Straw Hats' actions on Dressrosa and resulting new bounties, he was seen in his casual outfit along with a dark scarf draped over his shoulders and a wide brimmed straw hat. Twenty-four years ago, during Gol D. Roger's execution, Mihawk did not have his beard, nor did he wear his hat, and his hair was scruffier and shorter. He already had his crucifix pendant and sported what looked like a flower-patterned jacket. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Mihawk is shown with many scratches and bruises from training. He used a bokken as his weapon. He dressed in a dark-colored open jacket, short pants, shoes and a light-colored belt.", "personality": "Mihawk is mostly very serious. He rarely smiles, and he has only been seen laughing twice so far. He took the revelation about Luffy being Dragon's son in stride, despite the surprise of those around him. He never unnecessarily reveals emotions on the battlefield, even when something unexpected happens (such as Jozu intercepting his flying slash aimed at Whitebeard, or Luffy surviving his onslaught). As an infamous pirate, he is not someone ambitious or cruel and his only goal in life is to be outmatched by another swordsman. He displays a sense of honor as he recognizes and respects the swordsman's code and he even reluctantly permitted Roronoa Zoro the luxury of training at his hand for his dedication and selflessness. He is also unafraid to reference his title of \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\" in relation to himself, indicating a high level of confidence in his own abilities. He takes pride in his swordsmanship, believing that a nick on his sword is a blemish to his pride. Though he is confident in his strength, Mihawk remains grounded. While he has become jaded regarding the abilities of other swordsmen, due to facing numerous weaker opponents, he is able to recognize talent. In fact, he has a desire to see Zoro surpass him after having witnessed Zoro's incredible will and determination after their battle. When he speaks to Zoro, he states he will wait for Zoro, no matter how long it takes and notes that he will continue to be the world's strongest swordsman, showing great confidence in his own skills and abilities. Despite having grown bored with being challenged by inferior foes, Mihawk showed excitement at being chased as a pirate once more due to the dissolution of the Seven Warlords system. However, he was eventually became annoyed by the Marines' nuisances, causing Mihawk to relocate and became Crocodile's business partner. Mihawk is selective and whimsical when it comes to fulfilling his duties as a Warlord of the Sea, as evidenced by his history of poor attendance at Warlord summons, as well as his decision to hunt and harass some pirates over others. Zeff speculated that the reason Mihawk attacked Don Krieg and his men might have simply been because they disturbed his nap. Mihawk admitted that the only reason he followed them all the way back to East Blue from the Grand Line was to kill time. Although Mihawk is normally passive when dealing with others, he can come off as rather blunt and cold at times. When Perona was crying over Moria's presumed death, Mihawk coldly told her to leave, saying her crying was annoying him. This was also shown again when he did not tell her that he found out about Moria being alive while stating he had no reason to do so. Although Mihawk spends most of his time alone, he is fine with making company with people, such as Shanks and Perona. He also appears to have a sense of hospitality, having (somewhat) tolerated Perona and Zoro's presence upon his return to Kuraigana Island right after the Whitebeard War; he even went as far as relay to Zoro the events that occurred concerning his captain, Luffy. In addition, he offered a boat to help the Straw Hat's swordsman leave the island. He also told Perona to be safe when she decided to leave the castle. In spite of his apathetic behavior, Mihawk is capable of showing care and compassion to others. When Perona learned that Moria was alive, she immediately went to reunite with him and Mihawk wished for her to be safe, causing Perona to tearfully thank him for letting her stay with him for the last two years. It is later shown that he personally let her go out of concern for her well-being due to him anticipating the Seven Warlords system being abolished so she would not be in harms way when the Marines would be sent after him. Mihawk also shows curiosity for the people he decides to attack. He attempted to strike Whitebeard just to see what the power distance between himself and Whitebeard was. He also attacked Luffy just to see if fate is on Luffy's side or not. As a result, Mihawk is very analytical about others' abilities, and can recognize strengths that others may not, such as when he understood that Luffy's natural charisma and quick amassing of comrades is his most dangerous attribute. Mihawk has an interest in agriculture, having started farming and tilling the war-torn land of Kuraigana Island, influencing even the Humandrills who were normally fearful of Mihawk to join him. While Mihawk is generally compose and level-headed, he is capable of becoming violent when angered. Alongside Crocodile, he brutally punished Buggy after the latter became publicly recognized as the president of Cross Guild and their \"boss\". He would usually punish Buggy when his overzealous followers further enforced this image, despite how Buggy never actually tried to do this. Like many other characters he has a unique laugh, unusually bearing two: \"Wahhahhahha/Kukukuku\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Strongest Swordsman in the World in both name and reality, Mihawk is one of the strongest pirates in the world. Even before the Great Age of Pirates he gained fame by defeating stronger and stronger foes until he had no worthy challengers left, and now he reigns at the top as the strongest swordmaster in the world. Due to his strength and swordsmanship, Mihawk was a rival to Shanks, a future Emperor and great swordsman in his own right. They competed fiercely in legendary duels on a daily basis until Shanks lost his left arm to the Lord of the Coast. His immense skill in battle allowed him to easily destroy Don Krieg's entire fleet of 50 ships and 5,000 men by himself, with only the main ship surviving because a bad storm pushed them away. He easily wiped out the Marines' fleet (who are invading Kuraigana Island in their persistently attempts to arrest him). This monstrous display of strength caused Don Krieg to assume that Mihawk had Devil Fruit powers. Additionally, he easily defeated Roronoa Zoro two years prior, using only his cross-shaped knife that he wears as a pendant around his neck. During the Summit War of Marineford he did not receive as much as a scratch, despite having fought against Vista and Crocodile. A true testament to Mihawk's extraordinary strength is that after the Seven Warlords of the Sea were abolished, his bounty was raised to 3,590,000,000, one of the highest bounties in the world that even surpasses two of the current Four Emperors: Monkey D. Luffy and Buggy. His fellow ex-warlord Crocodile stated that an organization headed by himself and Mihawk would not go unnoticed by the Marines, which was proven true when Buggy was named one of the Four Emperors solely due to the Marine Headquarters belief that Mihawk and Crocodile work under him when in reality, they are the founders of the organization. In the past, he was known as the \"Marine Hunter\". Aside from his combat prowess, Mihawk is also an excellent cook, having cooked meals for both himself and Perona for two years. In the anime, he is shown applying his swordsmanship to his cooking, using kitchen knives to cut vegetables with incredible speed and precision. Mihawk possesses immense physical strength which he supplements with his swordsmanship. He was able to stop Zoro, a formidable swordsman with monstrous physical strength, with only a single knife that he held with one hand. Mihawk is extremely agile, as shown by his ability to jump and leap enormous heights and distances. He also has extraordinary reflexes, able to counter Luffy's Gear Second enhanced speed with ease. Mihawk is known as the \"Strongest Swordsman in the World\" because of his unparalleled skill with a sword. His vast mastery in swordsmanship even surpasses the skill level of his former rival Shanks, one of the Four Emperors of the Sea. He was also able to effortlessly defeat Zoro, a swordsman who is renowned all over the East Blue, two years prior with a single knife. Mihawk's swordsmanship is extremely versatile; he can create immensely powerful compressed air slashes that are able to destroy gigantic ships and enormous icebergs from great distances by using the \"Strong Blade\" swordsmanship, and can deflect the course of bullets with masterful and graceful precision using the \"Gentle Blade\" swordsmanship. He is also able to cut through steel with extreme ease and precision, as demonstrated with the steel-bodied Mr. 1, whom even Zoro struggled to defeat. Mihawk is also a talented teacher, as shown by Zoro's significant improvement in training under him for two years, which is more than the dojo had taught him in the many years he had trained there. Zoro himself admitted that even after training with Mihawk, he is still not anywhere near his level of skill as a swordsman, further attesting to Mihawk's combat and fighting prowess. Although Zoro skills were already developed dues to said years in the dojo and the adventures he went through with the Straw Hats. Mihawk is extremely proficient in Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Zoro. Mihawk's skill in Kenbunshoku Haki is extraordinary. True to his epithet, \"Hawk Eyes\", he has incredible eyesight, able to easily track Luffy's high-speed Gear 2 movements and strike with extreme precision. which neither Boa Sandersonia nor Boa Marigold could do. Mihawk possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. He taught Zoro how to use this type of Haki to protect his swords from any damage. Mihawk wields one of the 12 Supreme Grade Blades, the \"Black Blade\" Yoru, as his main weapon. Yoru is a curved, single-edged black blade in the shape of a latin cross, with a golden crossguard decorated by red cabochons (which are blue and green in the anime), and a hilt wrapped in bandages, with a particularly big cabochon at its extremity. When he accepts challenges for his title, he only draws this blade for those with enough spirit to earn Mihawk's respect, or enough power to present a threat; otherwise, his Kogatana is sufficient. Mihawk also has a cross-shaped knife that he wears as a pendant around his neck named Kogatana. He is shown using it as a tool to eat with, but combined with his supreme sword skills, it is also a deadly weapon capable of defeating any minor or moderately skilled swordsmen, even Zoro, a swordsman who wielded three blades during their duel. According to Mihawk, it is the smallest blade in his possession."},
{"name": "Donquixote Doflamingo", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Doflamingo is a very tall (standing at 10' and as a comparison taller than Kuzan as shown in their confrontation), light blond-haired, very lean and muscular man with tan skin. He generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored, with his light pink feather coat most distinctly of all. Doflamingo sports a pair of curved, thin white sunglasses, which appear to serve as his eyesight with red or purple lenses. He also walks with an odd, bow-legged waddle (though he does not always walk like this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. He has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. He also wears black dress shoes that are somewhat pointed. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction, with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange-tinted glasses, while in the anime (pre-timeskip) he has purple-tinted ones. He is also seen often, if not always, smiling. Two years after the war, Doflamingo's outfit is somewhat less elaborate, wearing a plain, open shirt that has small, dark Jolly Rogers as cufflinks, a different belt, and pink striped pants. However, he still wears his trademark sunglasses which have changed from purple to red lenses and dress shoes. Post-Timeskip, he drapes his feathered coat on his shoulders instead of leaving his arms in the sleeves, similar to many high-ranking Marines and pirates alike. He also now wears a golden hoop earring on each ear. After his defeat by Luffy, Doflamingo wore a horizontal striped prisoner outfit. Even as a child, Doflamingo spent most of the time wearing sunglasses, though he had not yet acquired his trademark ones. Before leaving Mary Geoise, Doflamingo wore the typical garb of the Celestial Dragons, and his hair fashioned the same style. After the family left Mary Geoise, his hair was changed to a simply neat and tidy in a bowl cut and his wardrobe consisted of simple fine clothes: a low-neck button-up shirt with black striped and a frilled cravat. However, due to the harsh life on the run from angry citizens, Doflamingo's appearance started to turn more disheveled; in a depiction, his shirt and hair grew messier and unkempt, going barefoot, sitting on a tattered chair near palm trees, smoking a cigarette. At age 10, after gaining loyalty from his four closest childhood friends, he changed out of his tattered noble clothes for a simpler, yet cleaner, black shirt, and white shorts. From this point onward, Doflamingo began to look more threatening. He eventually took on the appearance of a mob boss, wearing a black coat like a cloak over a pale lavender shirt with an unbuttoned collar, bole-colored shorts. His hair took on a spiky appearance, and he replaced his ordinary sunglasses with the trademark pair with spiral-shaped red lenses that he has now. At age 17, his hair was longer than it is currently, he had two earrings on his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead. In addition, he also wore sunglasses similar to the ones he wears today, but they had a different temple design and his signature feathered mantle. At age 25, when Law first came to him requesting membership in the crew, Doflamingo seemed to have done away with the goggles, but otherwise seemed the same in appearance; he wore a black dress shirt with a red tie and white pants with a bright red design, with his signature mantle over it, At age 28, during his trip to Minion Island he briefly wore a blood-red double-breasted suit with yellow-gold buttons, with matching blood-red dress pants and shoes, a pair of (dark green in the anime, black in the manga) gloves and changed his sunglasses to the ones he wears currently. By the time he was 31, he had his hair cut down to the current length. Currently, after his defeat at Dressrosa, Doflamingo now has Seastone shackles on his arms, legs, and entire chest, while chained to the floor of Tsuru's ship, he is also wearing a standard Impel Down prison uniform, with a few white bandages on his forehead as well. He was also given a new set of sunglasses."},

Because he ate a hippo SMILE, Dobon's legs have become infused with the bottom lip of an extremely large pink hippo, causing him to effectively sit inside the hippo's mouth. The hippo only has a pair of hind legs as Dobon's legs are the forelegs, and it wears dark pants with a belt around its hindquarters.", "personality": "Dobon is very gluttonous and selfish, getting angry at Monkey D. Luffy and Eustass Kid (being unaware of their strength, which allowed them to easily haul several hundred stone blocks within a day) for depleting the Prisoner Mines' kibi dango rations even though they worked to earn it, and he was willing to abuse his authority as deputy warden to withhold their earnings from them. He is also very flippantly callous towards prisoners, as shown when he stepped on Hyo.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Shinuchi in the Beasts Pirates, Dobon holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members, and as a vice warden of the Prisoner Mines, he has a great amount of authority over the prisoners there and can do whatever he likes to them. Dobon ate a Hippopotamus SMILE (SMILE, Kaba no Sumairu?), causing a hippopotamus' body to grow out from the back of his legs, resulting in his legs being fused with the hippo's lower lip. Dobon also gains hippo features on his face. The hippo's mouth is very large, and can fit Dobon as well as other people, which can give Dobon an advantage in battle if the hippo catches his opponents in its mouth, which is dubbed a \"Slaughter Room\" (, Zansatsu Beya?) by his subordinates. However, the hippo has a mind of its own, meaning it sometimes acts without Dobon's input, most notably closing its mouth and cutting Dobon off from those around him. Dobon wields two daggers, which he presumably uses to attack opponents when he catches them in his hippo's mouth."},

He has no pupil in his left eye. His Marine coat, draped on his shoulders like a cape, is more elaborate than the ones worn by other high-ranking officers, and the stripes across his cap are in a zig-zag pattern. Underneath his coat he sports an outfit reminiscent of those worn by naval officers in the 1600's, composed of a loose shirt with rope-like ornaments on it and suit pants. From Doberman's first introduction, he wore a red marine coat, that is changed to a white coat in the Summit War of Marineford in the anime. When Doberman first joined the marines, his jaw was less angular and his hair was shorter. He also still had both pupils, and only had a single X-shaped scar, under his left eye.", "personality": "Doberman firmly believes in Absolute Justice: he ordered the Marines to abandon injured soldiers and was willing to show Whitebeard's and Ace's heads as trophies to the world. He also claimed that Luffy was not to leave Marineford alive, for being Dragon's son. He was perceptive enough to see through Spandam's lie about Robin, but Doberman did nothing to stop the attack on her. When questioning Saint Saturn about the possibility of sacrificing every soldier on Egghead for their war against Vegapunk and the Straw Hat Pirates, Doberman did not argue with Saturn's view on how humans are no different than insects that can repopulate even if many are killed. He did, however, show affection for those he respected in Film Z as shown when he shed a tear when he and his fellow Marines were forced to kill their former instructor, Zephyr.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a vice admiral, Doberman is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside four other vice admirals. He also has command over lower-ranking subordinates. Doberman has a strong will as he was able to resist Luffy's Haoshoku Haki. He also survived the entire Summit War of Marineford without receiving any visible injuries. During the Marineford Arc, he was seen carrying around a katana, wielding it in his left hand, which may suggest that he's left-handed or ambidextrous. He was seen fighting on par with McGuy, one of Whitebeard's allies, in the anime. It was stated that all vice admirals possess Haki, so Doberman can also use the ability."},

{"name": "Doc Q", "episode": "Episode 223", "chapter": "Chapter 146", "year": 2002, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 234.", "appearance": "Doc Q, like the rest of his crewmates, is a very large man and is always seen traveling on the back of his horse Stronger, who is, similarly, an unusually large horse. His nose is slightly longer than normal, his face appears always unshaven, and there are straight purple tattoos coming from his hairline to the corners of his eyes. He has long and ash blonde hair, and constantly has a pallid look about him acting as though he is on the verge of death. He is seen wearing a black fur coat, a wide-brimmed, black beaten hat, and what appears to be a dark white hangman's noose around his neck. He would appear to wear a green turtleneck, and from under his coat sprouts what looks to be a brown robe, under which his hairy legs are visible. He has black, large-buckled shoes. On his back he carries a long, cylindrical bag, in which he keeps his scythe. His overall appearance resembles that of a stereotypical undertaker from Western fictions. Also, his pale skin, rather thin body, dark clothing, and use of a scythe is very similar to the typical Western image of a Grim Reaper; befitting of his epithet. As he is by his own admission very sick, this trait often shows on his expressions, as he commonly shows some level of pain and exhaustion, and sometimes stops during the middle of his sentences to cough. His chronic sickness is severe enough that he even has a gruesome tendency to bleed from his mouth. Despite these health problems, he also displays occasional smiles on matters he finds impressive. After the timeskip, he now wears his hair in two braids.", "personality": "Like the rest of his crew, Doc Q believes heavily in fate, although their views seem to center more on the belief of fortune and misfortune. Q seems to note when people are lucky or unlucky, and praises those with luck, while \"pitying\" the unlucky ones. However, he is not above changing his opinion should the circumstances prove otherwise, as seen when he notes Luffy to be \"lucky\" despite deeming him out of luck when Teach decided to target the Straw Hats. He is well-aware of his ailing body, but accepts it and even laughs about it.", "abilities_and_powers": "Despite Doc Q being chronically ill from a terminal disease, he is a very powerful pirate, having earned his place in the Blackbeard Pirates' high standard for powerful individuals. In fact, as Blackbeard refuses to accept any weaklings into his crewgoing so far as to reject Super Rookie Jewelry Bonney with a bounty of 140,000,000is a further testament to Doc Q's fighting prowess. After Blackbeard became one of the Four Emperors, Doc Q was promoted to the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates' ninth ship, granting him authority over all lower-ranking members. As the doctor of the crew, Doc Q has the medical skills to help them. When Jesus Burgess suffered massive amount of injuries from Sabo's Mera Mera no Mi, he gave specific instructions to Shiryu and Laffitte to bring Doc Q to treat him. Doc Q seems to be a skilled chemist as he developed an explosive solutions he infused inside apples that will explode in one bite. He can trick ignorant bystanders into eating his apples and should they pick one with the explosive, they explode in a gruesome manner. Despite being stricken with a fatal chronic disease since childhood, Doc Q has formidable superhuman physical prowess as seenalong with BurgessDoc Q could paddle their raft with fairly large paddles and is able to keep up pace with Burgess, a man with titanic strength. At the Summit War of Marineford, Doc Q was able to brutally injure a weakened Whitebeard with his scythe, causing him to shed copious amount of blood. He wields his large scythe with only one arm and also attacks consecutively with great speed. Despite his chronic illness, he has also shown himself to have extraordinary endurance. He withstood a Gura Gura no Mi shock wave from Whitebeard (albeit not a direct hit), and later took a direct hit from Sengoku's shockwave in Buddha form, then standing up with only a small amount of trouble. In fact, not only did Doc Q manage to survive into adulthood while stricken with the chronic illness that is debilitating enough to cause him to frequently cough blood, he survived being exposed to Magellan's deadly venom long enough for Shiryu to administer the antidote, an incredible feat given his extremely sickly constitution compared to other members of the Blackbeard Pirates. Doc Q ate the Shiku Shiku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to afflict others with diseases. Doc Q mainly relies on his horse Stronger for transportation due to him being too sickly to walk on his own. At Marineford, Doc Q rode on his horse during the Blackbeard Pirates' simultaneous assault on Whitebeard. In the anime, he moved with incredible speed and maneuverability, being the second to land a hit on Whitebeard after Shiryu. Doc Q wields a double-bladed scythe, which he used to attack Whitebeard at the Summit War of Marineford. Doc Q can use his explosive apples as weapons during battle. He has apparently gained a notorious reputation for using them, as the Heart Pirates were able to immediately identify the apples he had as bombs when he dropped the basket holding them during his battle with said crew."},

{"name": "Denjiro", "episode": "Episode 919", "chapter": "Chapter 909", "year": 2018, "note": "He was first introduced under his alias \"Kyoshiro\". Real identity revealed in Chapter 973.", "appearance": "Denjiro is a very tall and muscular man, standing at 306cm. Before Oden's execution, he used to have rather big and round eyes as well as dark blue hair that was always kept in a long ponytail. He was always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses. When he was young, he wore a dark kimono with a four-leaf clover pattern; his face was also much rounder compared to its more pointed edges as an adult. As an adult, he wore a dark kimono with a small crescent moon on the left side of the chest. Because of his grudge toward Orochi, Denjiro's appearance changed sometime in the last 20 years. His eyes became slanted, he no longer wears sunglasses, he grew large sideburns, and his hair color lightened considerably. Eventually, he also started hiding his ponytail in a massive faux-pompadour. He wears a dark blue kimono with circles and target patterns on it, as well as a blue, high-collared cape. During the raid on Onigashima, he took off his faux-pompadour when revealing his identity. When preparing to infiltrate the castle, he wore the Beasts Pirates foot soldier uniform. When going out as Ushimitsu Kozo, Denjiro wore a yellow ninja outfit and put a yellow hokkamuri bandana over his head to hide his hair.", "personality": "When he was young, he took pride in his abilities to manipulate people and get what he wants. He was a fan of Kozuki Oden even before becoming his retainer, and held him in high regard for his bold actions. Oden's death was so traumatic that the very process of grieving caused Denjiro's facial structure to be altered. Denjiro's loyalty and strength of will cannot be understated. An unspecified time after Oden's execution, Denjiro (as Kyoshiro) became a subordinate to Kurozumi Orochi and spent the better part of the past 20 years earning his trust in order to find a chance to overthrow him and restore the Kozuki Family to power. Denjiro has shown great emotional control, despite his immense hatred for Orochi. He is able to perfectly restrain himself from expressing it and even bowed to the latter as well as protecting him from Zoro in order to not jeopardize the Kozuki revolution on the Fire Festival. After becoming Oden's retainer, he and the rest of the Scabbards worked to aid him in any way, until they were caught by Shimotsuki Yasuie during their attempt to steal his money. After being lectured by Yasuie, Denjiro and the rest of the Scabbards became noble and educated samurai. Denjiro, being the more knowledgeable one, was the one who would take some of the teaching onto himself. Denjiro served as the voice of reason for Oden, especially when it came to Kuri's finances. Denjiro attempted to advise Oden against making foolish decisions like giving Orochi money and leaving Wano, though Oden was rarely persuaded. Denjiro has also shown to be very kind, as after becoming Kyoshiro, he works hard in secret to give money to the citizens left impoverished by Orochi's tyranny, and he also took the responsibility of caring for Hiyori after she was separated from Kawamatsu. As Kyoshiro, Denjiro acts as a cheerful man who loves to drink. While intoxicated, he was unafraid of speaking bluntly about the shogun Orochi despite the potential danger, and he mocked the shogun for believing a prophecy from Kozuki Toki about his downfall. In this state, he is prone to experiencing rapid mood swings, ranging from laughter to intensity to falling asleep. He falls asleep in public frequently due to being up in the middle of the night as Ushimitsu Kozo. Due to his self-indulgence, Denjiro does not appear to bother with his obligations as the boss of his family. This was seen when he ordered his subordinate to contact Queen himself for an assassin to eliminate an individual who refused to comply with their extortion. However, he still cares about his family and will do what he needs to have them defended or avenged, regardless of how low-ranking they are. Ultimately, he is quite diligent when he feels like it, as he was able to raise Komurasaki to become Wano's top-ranking oiran. He even protected Orochi as the loyal guard dog from Roronoa Zoro's attack against the shogun. However, his efforts to help Orochi are all a ruse to help the Kozuki Family on the day of the final battle. As Denjiro trapped Sasaki, he showed a confident smile as their revolution proceed smoothly, finally elated that his patience in waiting for a chance to avenge Oden has paid off as he can finally exact revenge on Kaidou and Orochi.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro is a powerful samurai whom Kin'emon states (alongside Kawamatsu and Ashura Doji) is worth 100 men in battle. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure the former Emperor Kaidou in his full dragon form. As the boss of the Kyoshiro Family and (formerly) one of the highest-ranking subordinates of the Kurozumi Family, Denjiro is one of the wealthiest, most influential citizens of the Flower Capital, able to hire high-ranking geisha dancers to perform for him. He had enough wealth to sponsor and groom Hiyori into the highest-ranking oiran in Wano. As a yakuza boss, Denjiro commands strong henchmen who can extort businesses for money. Thanks to his connections with Wano's shogunate, Denjiro could strengthen his group further by requesting assistance from his allies, notably the Beasts Pirates, who appeared to treat him quite respectfully before his betrayal was revealed, as Page One referred to him as \"Boss Kyoshiro\" (, Kyshir Oyabun?). Denjiro possesses immense physical strength, being able to clash with Roronoa Zoro in terms of physical power. When he first walked into the Flower Capital as Kyoshiro, he easily beat aside two men who confronted him, and his display of strength impressed other men into wanting to become his followers. Alongside his fellow Scabbards, Denjiro managed to push Kaidou off his feet when ambushing him. He was capable of effortlessly decapitating Kurozumi Orochi, in his massive Mythical Zoan form, with the shogun being unable to react either time. Denjiro is extremely agile, as shown when he ran and leapt across rooftops when robbing houses at night as Ushimitsu Kozo. From a very young age, Denjiro was extremely clever and persuasive, a skill he would use to trick and swindle other people, including shopkeepers, for his own gain. He also showed extensive knowledge regarding the politics of the Flower Capital yakuza. He also learned faster than his fellow Nine Red Scabbards during their self-education, later teaching them himself. During his years as Kyoshiro, Denjiro showed great cunning, having not only founded his own yakuza family but also was quickly able to get into Orochi's service, becoming one of his highest ranking subordinates and gaining enough influence to have connections with the Beasts Pirates while perfectly hiding his allegiances to the Kozuki Family. He was able to earn the trust of the extremely cunning and cautious Orochi to be placed in charge of the Flower Capital during the Fire Festival. Denjiro is a masterful thief both because of his charisma as well as his ability to sneak into other people's homes and steal money. For at least thirteen years, he has robbed homes in the Flower Capital at night without anyone realizing his identity. After Orochi fell in love with Komurasaki, Denjiro devised a clever idea to separate the two of them, telling Hiyori to carry a blood bag so he could fake her death when necessary. After years of servitude towards Orochi, Denjiro was able to gain insight into Orochi's mindset, correctly deducing the fact he had implanted a spy among his comrades, which Orochi had kept secret from most people except Kaidou. Thus, Denjiro had opted to reveal his identity to Kin'emon only during the Fire Festival. Denjiro's intellect makes him an outstanding tactician. He chose to take full advantage of his changed appearance to live under a different identity, putting on a front of submitting to Orochi and becoming one of his most loyal subordinates in order to amass both wealth and influence that allowed him to further his cause in supporting the Kozuki Family such as raising and protecting Kozuki Hiyori for thirteen years. He showed incredible caution, as he advised Hiyori to live under an alias to protect herself from Orochi and the Beasts Pirates, and came up with a plan of faking her death that allowed her to escape Orochi's wrath. He also instructed Hiyori to keep his identity a secret from even their allies, which would prove crucial as Kanjuro, a fellow member of the Nine Red Scabbards, was revealed to be a spy for Orochi. Denjiro was opportunistic enough to exploit the trust of Orochi and the Beast Pirates, using his temporary authority over the Flower Capital to liberate the one thousand prisoners of Rasetsu District to join him in the Kozuki revolution as well as sinking one of the Beasts Pirates' ships when they let their guard down in his presence. Denjiro would also repeat this deception on Sasaki, one of the Beast Pirates' Tobiroppo who still thought he was an ally, with Denjiro being able to subdue him without any effort. Denjiro possesses the greatest mastery in swordsmanship among the Nine Red Scabbards. His skill was shown when he deflected Roronoa Zoro's 720-Pound Phoenix with ease and proceeded to evenly clash with Zoro's Two Sword Style with only one sword for a brief time, preventing him from pursuing Orochi. He was masterful enough to precisely cut through the blood bag Hiyori wore under her kimono without striking her body, allowing them to fake her death while she remained unharmed in reality. He cleanly cut through one of the Beasts Pirates' massive ships with a flying slash. Denjiro is also capable of emulating Oden's signature Oden Two Sword Style style, allowing him to fight wielding two swords and perform one of his techniques. Denjiro is a master of Busoshoku Haki, which is known as \"Ryuo\" in Wano. He can harden his swords and possesses an advanced level of Busoshoku Haki, as shown when he cuts through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin. In the anime when Denjiro uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as a yellow and orange colored flowing aura. Denjiro possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Demaro Black", "episode": "Episode 598", "chapter": "Chapter 517", "year": 2010, "note": "His real name was revealed by a Pacifista in Chapter 601.", "appearance": "Black is a large and obese man whose face is very broad, with his forehead jutting prominently forward, almost concealing his eyebrows entirely. He has facial hair that extends from the ends of his mouth to his chin, and his nose comprises of a narrow bridge, sloping outward, like the forehead, and ending in a large, wide, and rounded set of nostrils. His legs are thin and hairy. He is almost always smiling or laughing even after being wounded. He also has an X-shaped scar on his stomach and another scar on his left shoulder. His flintlock is always in his hand or tucked in his pants. In his attempt to impersonate Luffy, Black wears similar apparel. He also has an imitation scar beneath his left eye. However, the similarities end there. His scar has three stitches instead of two, his straw hat is frayed and unkempt with a striped band around its circumference, his shirt is open and too tight to close due to his obese figure, and he wears boots rather than sandals like the real Luffy. He also wears blue jeans like Luffy but without the fur lining and the real Luffy wears shorts while Black's jeans go to his shins. Black wore a typical pirate coat when addressing his recruits. All in all, he looks virtually nothing like the real Luffy.", "personality": "Black's personality is quite similar to that of the World Nobles, albeit somewhat less extreme, believing that impressive heritage and high status will grant him immunity and undeserved rights. The difference is that the World Nobles, and other Royalty, are mostly correct, unfortunately, and do receive such privileges, while Black's ruse is only impressive to other criminals. He is extremely ruthless and egotistical, using the real Luffy's reputation to act with impunity. With Luffy's exceedingly high bounty and known infamy, Black believes he can get away with virtually anything. He treats his reputation as an entitlement, expecting others to accommodate him simply because he is a famous pirate. He seems to have enough common sense to realize that his reputation alone will not protect him from everyone, though he still attempts to use it as leverage in a pinch. Black angers easily when things do not go as planned, or at any perceived slight by anyone he meets. He treats something as simple as being knocked down as an offense to kill someone over. This seems to extend from his stolen reputation, as he believes the act gives him the right to behave as such. Because of his ego, Black, in attempting to exact revenge, seems to be blinded to the dangers his opponents represent. Despite the real Nami, Usopp, and Luffy all dispatching him and his immediate crew with casual ease, his anger drives him to get revenge at any cost, even gathering his entire collection of recruits just to deal with three people. He also attempted to talk down Sentomaru using his reputation, even though Sentomaru clearly did not buy his act. Unlike the real Luffy, who places little importance to a person's background, Black takes every opportunity to brag about his heritage and accomplishments, which he uses to justify his actions; in fact, he uses it as his primary weapon to intimidate his opponents in order to defend himself. He has no qualm with hurting innocent people, apologizing sarcastically after accidentally shooting bystanders he mistook for his enemies. He places no importance on the well-being of his crew, viewing them as a means to an end. By comparison, Fake Sogeking shows more care of his crew mates than him. He also appears to be a coward, using the fake Nami as a sacrificial lamb to escape Usopp's man-eating plant. Black's arrogance seems to cloud his better judgment. Having met the real Nami, Usopp, Luffy, and Chopper, he failed to recognize any of them. Black had to be told of Chopper's identity by the fake Sanji and Zoro. It was also apparent that Black did not take into the account the consequences of impersonating a notorious pirate such as Luffy, apparently forgetting the fact that he was currently wanted by the World Government, not to mention the fact that the real Luffy made scores of enemies on the wrong side of the law in achieving his level of notoriety and that some of them may even exploit the Fake Straw Hats recruitment scheme in order to get close enough to target the impersonators, which led to the fake's capture and Sentomaru even stated that Black and his fellow impostors were idiots. This mindset, coupled with his ego, ultimately led to Black's downfall when his empty threats against Sentomaru backfired. Like many characters in the world of One Piece, he also have an unique Laughter Style, which is \"Dohahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Black appears to survive solely on his ability to manipulate others, having little apparent combat skills to speak of. His skill in deception was quite impressive as every person who did not know Luffy previously actually believed that Black was the Straw Hat captain, although Sentomaru noted that anyone who believed the impostor's lie was considered stupid. Unable to defend himself against more powerful opponents, Black instead relies on his stolen reputation as Straw Hat Luffy to intimidate foes into not fighting back, though he is smart enough to realize that not all of his opponents would be deceived by this. The one thing that can be said in Black's favor is that he is fairly durable, managing to walk away from attacks by Usopp's Pop Greens and Nami's thunderbolt, albeit while somewhat injured. However, Sentomaru knocked him out in a single strike from the broad side of his axe. He has also been shown to have a weak will, as Luffy was easily able to knock him out using Haki. He has been shown using a flintlock pistol in combat, but his proficiency with it does not seem to extend beyond shooting people who anger him at point blank range."},
{"name": "Dellinger", "episode": "Episode 702", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Dellinger is a very short, slim teenager with shaggy shoulder-length blonde hair and a generally effeminate appearance. His clothing is simple, consisting of light-colored hoop earrings (white in the anime) on his ears, a white baseball cap with horns coming out of it on his head and a mark on the center of his hat shaped like a dark fighting fish (colored blue in the anime), a long sleeved shirt with a giraffe-like design on it, blue shorts, and dark purple stilettos.Though his eyes are innocent-looking outside of combat, if he becomes bloodthirsty, his irises grow wide and red, similar to those of the fighting fish and the way Arlong's eyes change when angered, as well as those of the Lord of the Coast. Stemming from his fish-man heritage, he has a fighting fish dorsal fin located on his back and horns coming out of his head. This fin appears to be retractable as Dellinger was able to keep it hidden until he attacked Blue Gilly. He also has sharp, retractable teeth that he can grow out by forcing his human teeth out of their gums. As a newborn baby, without even being a year old, Dellinger had an even smaller version of his hat with tiny horns poking through and a small fish drawn on it. He was wearing normal baby clothes, with his already visible fish-man dorsal fin popping through it. At six years old, he wore a backpack and the giraffe-like patterns were only on the lower half of his shirt. The mark on his hat was shaped like an ordinary dark fish (blue in the anime).", "personality": "Dellinger has a flamboyant and flashy attitude that matches his eccentric fashion sense. He seems confident in his abilities, as well as a bit arrogant, as he tells Bellamy that he is going to kill him right after demeaning him. He's also a bit too carefree, as he apparently has a habit of blabbing things he knows to others, such as secret information like Doflamingo's order for him to dispose of Bellamy. Because of his confidence, Dellinger holds his own heritage of fighting fish fish-man with pride. In battle, he is rather sadistic and bloodthirsty, such as when he's fighting against Suleiman. Dellinger also believes that strong people don't require honor, as he mocks Ideo for having such ideals. That said, he's prone to cockiness and as such, doesn't take a lot of situations seriously. This leads to him to be quickly defeated by Cavendish in his Hakuba form when Gladius tries to warn him to stay back but he did not listen. He is also shown to be easily annoyed when someone else hinders him from killing his intended target. He becomes very angry at Bartolomeo for protecting Bellamy and swears retribution for his actions. Stating that this is his \"family's business\", he also shows strong bonding to his own crew, which he considers his family. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story. In the anime, he is heard speaking with a double voice, using a pitched and effeminate tone when talking casually, and a deep and masculine tone when fighting or threatening rivals. In the anime, when Dellinger was cut, he was shown visibly worried at seeing his own blood due to a sleepwalking Cavendish slashing him, possibly indicating he never been wounded before or meeting someone who outmatched his speed. Concludes non-canon section.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Dellinger held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. Due to his fish-man heritage, Dellinger is powerful enough to frequently participate in the Corrida Colosseum's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high. It is said that when Dellinger and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory. Arguably the greatest testament to his considerable battle prowess is Dellinger's membership in Doflamingo's crew for the entire 16 years of his life, starting from his infancy, an impressive feat considering that, according to Diamante, of the 100 people that tried to join the crew, only the absolute strongest remained after just two days. At six years old, he assisted in the takeover of Dressrosa as the youngest member of the crew. As a testament to his strength, Doflamingo trusts him enough to task him with killing Bellamy, an older pirate with a bounty of 195,000,000. This faith turned out to be valid, as Dellinger easily managed to defeat Bellamy, nearly killing him (if not for Bartolomeo's interference). He later easily defeated Suleiman, Blue Gilly, Dagama, and Ideo. Despite being a powerful member of the group, he was swiftly defeated by Cavendish in his Hakuba form in one strike. As a human-fish-man hybrid, Dellinger was born physically stronger than the average human, going by his ability to lift cannonballs at two years of age without problems. He has extreme superhuman leg strength as the force of his kicks can easily move a ten-ton Machvise (although the feat did cause Dellinger pain) and knock out the martial artist Blue Gilly with a single blow while leaving no time for the latter to react. Having a pair of horns, he can use them to gore his foes through headbutts in a spear-like fashion, a technique he shows to be proficient with, but he can still be immobilized when doing so by being caught and not let go of his horns. He additionally seems to have the ability to grow new teeth whenever he wants, similar to Arlong, as well as being able to choose between human teeth and sharp fighting fish fangs at his will. Moreover, Dellinger has extraordinary superhuman speed as he can move fast enough to create several temporary duplicates to surprise unsuspecting foes and effortlessly dodged Ideo's attacks."},

The hat bears their Jolly Roger: two skulls and a cross-bone, with a wavy design over it. They both wear yellow long gloves with razor-sharp nails at the end on both hands.", "abilities_and_powers": "The Decalvan Brothers have managed to make themselves an infamous reputation in the New World, becoming subordinates of the Whitebeard Pirates. After Squard, they were Whitebeard's choice in leading the other subordinate crews to attack Marineford. In the anime, they were able to fight on par with Vice Admiral Dalmatian to stall him.

Since he is called a pyromaniac, he could potentially suffer from pyromania, a compulsive disorder characterized by obsession with fire or uncontrollable urges to start fires, which would also explain his desire to obtain the Mera Mera no Mi.[citation needed] He has been shown to be honorable, as seen when he confronted Doflamingo with the other gladiators to buy Luffy time.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about his skills in combat, but he must be confident in his strength as he entered as a contestant at theCorrida Colosseum. Damask's mask has a flamethrower built into the mouth section, capable of spitting intense streams of flames and seems to be emitting smoke even during times when it is not in use."},
{"name": "Daruma", "episode": "Episode 611", "chapter": "Chapter 530", "year": 2011, "note": "", "appearance": "Daruma is a cookie cutter shark fish-man, being the smallest one amongst the officers of the crew by far, as well as one of the smallest fish-men that appeared so far in the series. He has circular eyes, a flat nose and sharp teeth; his arms are notably larger than his hands and his skin is red. On his right arm is a tattoo of the New Fish-Man Pirates' Jolly Roger. He sports a distinctive head gear composed of a hat similar to an aviator's, with two massive protrusion on both sides of his head, pointing upwards, and decorated on the front, paired with a plumed crest on top of it, similar to those found on ancient Roman and Greek helmets. He also wears a dark, sleeve and zipperless open jacket with a fur collar and a pair of Bermuda shorts. As a teenager, he wore a large, dark top hat with a strange creature imprinted on the front, somehow reminiscent of both a mollusk and a standard Jolly Roger's skull, a simple A-shirt with spots on the upper part, just below the neck, and dark shorts. After being arrested and put in prison, his body heavily aged due to the negative effects of the Energy Steroids, with his face covered in wrinkles and his arms and legs becoming really skinny. He now wears a prison jumpsuit but still sports his aviator helmet.", "personality": "He appears to be violent and hungry as he says they should \"gnash up\" the escaping humans' meat. Like Hody Jones and the other officers, he follows Arlong's ideals and despises humans as well as Otohime's ideals. He is not above using threats to force the Fish-Man Island citizens to comply and follow the New Fish-Man Pirates. He seems to have a carnal urge to bite things, as he gets restless when he has not used his jaws for a while, and even says they ache; this leads him to despise sweets and snacks, and instead wants hard fish bones to gnaw on.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, Daruma has control over his lower-ranked subordinates. Daruma possesses tremendous willpower being completely unfazed by Luffy's Haoshoku Haki burst. Despite his small size, Daruma is still a fish-man, and thus possesses ten times the strength of an average human, and even more underwater. Being an officer and a shark fish-man, he is probably even stronger than that. Daruma has shown himself as having very powerful jaws that are rapidly able to pulverize stone walls. He was also able to intentionally combust by unknown means. However, after the negative effects of the Energy Steroids took effect, he became weak and old, stripping him of all his strength. Like the rest of the crew, Daruma consumed Energy Steroids during the battle against the three princes of Ryugu Kingdom, who are crowned the strongest soldiers in the entire island, and was able to overpower them due to this. The drug doubles his strength per pill, but shaves off a portion of his lifespan. This also had another side effect of making him old and weak after he was arrested, which lost him the strength he naturally had."},
{"name": "Dalmatian", "episode": "Episode 553", "chapter": "Chapter 462", "year": 2009, "note": "", "appearance": "With his Devil Fruit powers active, Dalmatian takes the form of a muscular, bipedal dalmatian-human hybrid. The top part of his head from his nose up and his arms and legs are that of a dalmatian: a white dog with black spots all over the body. He also has a long tail. However, the bottom half of his face is human just like most of Zoan users, and he has a blonde-white beard on a wide chin. His torso and neck also seem to remain human. He has yet to be seen in his default human or full dalmatian forms. As a marine recruit, he had a standard marine cap and his face only had stubble on his chin with his Devil Fruit powers active. Like all other vice admirals and other high ranking officers, he wears a double breasted suit, dress shirt, and a tie, with a Marine jacket draped loosely over his shoulders like a cape. His suit, in particular, is dark green in color. He wears a light red shirt underneath, with a darker red tie.", "personality": "As a Marine, Dalmatian has a strong sense of justice. It is unknown whether he believes in moral justice or absolute justice.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a Marine vice admiral, Dalmatian is capable of responding to a Buster Call alongside four other vice admirals. He also has command over lower-ranking subordinates. Dalmatian has eaten an unnamed Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a dalmatian. Using this, he can increase his fighting abilities and physical strength greatly, and can combine it with his Rokushiki style. Dalmatian has access to the Rokushiki martial arts style and he has demonstrated the techniques Soru and Shigan, allowing him to move at incredible speed and pierce his opponents with his finger, respectively. The powers of his physical techniques are further enhanced by his Devil Fruit transformation. His Shigan has also been enhanced by the sharp nail point added to his finger, allowing him to pierce Luffy's rubber body.

{"name": "Daz Bonez", "episode": "Episode 160", "chapter": "Chapter 103", "year": 2000, "note": "His real name was revealed by Smoker in Chapter 217.", "appearance": "Daz is a tanned man with long, thin limbs and fingers. He is tall and very muscular and his head is shaven. His most striking feature is probably the black unibrow, right over his round eyes. He has big lips and the archaic Japanese symbol of the number \"1\" (, ichi?) tattooed on his torso. In Arabasta, he sported an oriental-looking attire consisting of a sleeveless dark coat with golden edges and white motifs on the front, over very loose beige pants held up by a white sash around the waist, with some light brown fur sprouting from it. His pants were tucked inside some bandages wrapped around his calves and in part around his shoes. In Impel Down, like most prisoners, he wore striped prisoner clothing. He gained a scar to the right of his right eye, likely a result of something that occurred while or after he was taken to Impel Down. (Due to the fact that he lacked such a scar or any sort of facial injury during the Miss Goldenweek mini arc, it is impossible for him to have obtained the scar during his fight with Zoro.) During his break-out of his cell, he was bare-chested, with his shirt tied around his waist. After the Summit War of Marineford, he sports a dark suit over a plain open shirt, with a tie kept loose around his neck.", "personality": "Daz is very stern, calm, focused, disciplined, self-assured and confident. Due to his Devil Fruit abilities, he has come to think of himself as unbeatable. He is laconic and serious at all times and does not tolerate weakness or frivolity. Daz also has the belief that having friendships makes one weak. Surprisingly, he does not seem to care for grudges either; he assisted Luffy in the escape from Impel Down due to Crocodile's orders, barely noting the fact that Zoro and Luffy are companions. Mr. 1 was notorious within West Blue for his previous profession as an assassin (under his real name \"Daz Bonez\"), implying he was (and still is) highly skilled at stealth and killing efficiently. He also demonstrated to be merciless to those that dare challenge him to combat, and is not concerned with the swordsmen code of conduct as he attacked Zoro while in a vulnerable and defenseless position. However, he demonstrates high loyalty to those that treat him with respect (Crocodile), and is not a petty man clouded by past bias or judgements. In battle, he is utterly merciless and bloodthirsty, such as hitting Roronoa Zoro while the pirate was wounded and unable to defend himself after licking his enemy's blood off his own hands. He was also indifferent to the fate of a fellow prisoner that he knocked into a boiling pot; at the same time, he licked the blood trickling down from his own head injury. Nevertheless, Daz does have some sense of honor, as he accepted his defeat at Zoro's hands. While Daz is generally a cold-hearted person, as a child, he secretly had a dream of becoming a superhero. When Miss Goldenweek materialized this dream, his face showed great discomfort, but was actually quite thrilled in secret.", "abilities_and_powers": "Formerly a bounty hunter from the West Blue known as \"The Killer\", Daz Bonez is a proficient hand to hand martial artist and highly dangerous combatant feared for his talents in assassinating criminals. Even Smoker, a formidably powerful Marine in his own right, acknowledged Bonez as a powerful opponent and was surprised Zoro managed to defeat him. Befitting his profession, he has considerable knowledge in assassination, as seen when he started targeting Nami before Zoro in Alubarna, saying that the first rule of assassination is \"pick off the weakest target first\". His power was great enough to put him in the Level 4 of Impel Down, where he defeated a fellow prisoner easily. He is strong enough to defeat many Whitebeard Pirates members and their allies from the New World. His strength has earned Crocodile's respect, something that most Baroque Works members and even Crocodile's right-hand woman, Nico Robin, did not get. Crocodile went out of his way to free Daz from his cell to assist him in the upcoming war. His skills are good enough to be recognized by the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, who does not bother to remember the names of every weakling that he crushes. He is strong enough to be unafraid of the New World as he has no problem going there. It can also be surmised that after two years, Daz grew much stronger, as he not only survived his time in the New World with Crocodile, but also helped destroy the Marine ships sent after Buggy after the dissolution of the Warlords system. Even without his Devil Fruit powers, he is a very dangerous, extremely strong man, possessing considerable superhuman strength and endurance. This was seen when he was incarcerated in Impel Down and simply gave a headbutt to a fellow prisoner (who was larger than him) that proved strong enough to knock the man over a great distance. Mr. 1 was also most likely wearing seastone shackles at the time, and was punched by the prisoner hard in the head, but simply shrugged the pain off before retaliating. Even the intense heat of Level 4 there seemed to have little to no effect on him. Daz even managed to block a slash of Mihawk, although the following attack cut him down instantly. Mr. 1 was approximately equal to Roronoa Zoro physically in Arabasta, where the latter managed to lift up a largely intact building off the ground with his bare hands. Even the intense heat of Level 4 there seemed to have little to no effect on him. Daz ate the Supa Supa no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to turn any part of his body into sharp steel blades. This power gives him a near endless variety of slashing abilities, and it makes his body as hard as steel, making him almost immune to damage. He can transform any body parts of his choosing into blades, allowing him to perfectly combine blade work with martial arts skills, literally making him a living weapon; he can turn his arms into blades to augment his hand chops, turn his legs into blades to augment his kicks, turn his fingers into blades to make them like razor sharp claws, and even turn the bottoms of his feet into blades so that he can glide across the ground as if he were ice skating. Since his entire body is a blade, his blades have no front or back, making his swordplay difficult to counter. Notably, he can move his blades across his skin. For example, he can extend curved blades from his forearm at an angle perpendicular to his arm, then make the blades rotate around his arm, effectively turning his forearms into mini-tiller blades that shred anything they touch."},

He wears a long, white fur-lined green tunic and has armor plates on his arms; these plates are retained on his fore legs when assuming his full-bison form. Sometimes he covers his head with a green and white fur lined hat, equipped with ear-flaps against Drum Island's intense cold, and he always wears long boots. He carries his weapon of choice, an extra-large spade, in a sheath that hangs on his back. In Chapter 0, he was seen wearing a more regal armor, and his hair was also parted in three points, instead of one. After the timeskip, as the king of the country, he started wearing a fur-lined cape with the kingdom's symbol on it over his standard attire.", "personality": "Dalton is a brave warrior and compassionate man who deeply cares for the people of Drum Island and, in return, the people of Drum have learned to trust him. He is considerably honorable, despising his service to Wapol when he was king and visibly weeping for Dr. Hiriluk upon his death before urging Chopper to live to fulfill Hiriluk's dream to save the kingdom. As the new king of Sakura Kingdom, he lives a simple and humble life, refusing to live in the castle and preferring to live amongst the common people of Drum Island. Dalton claims that he likes the rice with chestnuts of Bighorn. He has the habit of giving people completely trivial information that they never asked for when describing a topic of discussion.", "abilities_and_powers": "Dalton is a capable and powerful fighter. He was strong enough that Wapol had to consume all of the weapons in his armory just to defeat him. He possesses great strength, which is enhanced by his Devil Fruit power, and he is fast enough to surprise Wapol and decapitate him with a single blow. He is also extremely resilient, as he took many arrows from Chess and was covered by an avalanche, and yet survived. Dalton also has considerable leadership skills, keeping the Drum Kingdom from falling into chaos for years after it was abandoned by Wapol and his men before eventually becoming king himself through election by the kingdom's people. Dalton ate the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that enables him to transform into a bison and into a half-human/half-bison form that resembles a minotaur. His Hybrid form is primarily utilized for combat, and is powerful enough to stop Chopper's Heavy Point. The main advantage of this fruit, however, does not seem to be the enhanced strength but, strangely enough, the speed: his quadrupedal bovine state allows him to run at a much higher speed than his default human state, making it ideal for transportation. He proved to be incredibly fast, evading the bullets shot at him by Wapol's soldiers with tremendous agility. In his hybrid form Dalton uses Fiddle Banff, which allows him to twirl his sword and charge the opponent at an incredible speed, slicing up anything in its path. This attack works especially well against large groups of enemies. Dalton's main weapon is a spade, a large pole-arm with an over-sized blade. It is not shaped like most spades though (which have fan-like shapes such as the famous Shaolin Spade), and is rather unusual in its shape, being a long double-edged sword-like polearm with a round tip instead of a sharp point. Its overall appearance looks like an oar, but with a metal head instead of wood. Dalton proved to be quite proficient with his blade, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, which allows him to attack at tremendous speed and slice up anything in his path, defeating a large group of soldiers swiftly."},

{"name": "Crocodile", "episode": "Episode 126", "chapter": "Chapter 76", "year": 2000, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nefertari Vivi in Chapter 113.", "appearance": "Crocodile is a tall man with a wide chest, broad shoulders, muscular arms and legs, and a thick neck. He has pale skin and nape-length black hair, which is kept neatly slicked back, though strands tend to fall in front of his face during battles. Crocodile has various battle wounds, most notably a long-stitched scar at the bridge of his nose that stretches across his face and a large hook made from a tough gold alloy in place of his left hand. His eyes are deep-set and heavy-lidded, and his thin eyebrows are characteristically drawn upward in the middle. This gives his usual facial expression a feeling of condescension and distrust. Crocodile speaks with a deep, relaxed voice, and he is usually seen smoking a thick cigar produced by his company. In the anime, his skinis somewhat of a grayish color. His theme of dress is meant to convey the image of an Italian mafia boss. In his original appearance, Crocodile wore a bright orange, black-striped button up vest over a long-sleeve peach shirt (white in the manga and One Piece: Pirate Warriors series), along with a blue scarf, dark brown suit pants, and polished black shoes with gold buckles. He also wore a long, thick, dark pelted fur coat (fully dark green in the manga and One Piece: Pirate Warriors, dark gray with a regular gray fur trim in the anime, and dark green with a light green trim in Movie 8) over his shoulders. After he was incarcerated at Impel Down, he wore a striped prisoner uniform, like most other prisoners, but was somehow permitted to keep his gold hook. After joining Luffy and Jinbe on their mission to save Ace, he obtained a full change of clothes from the supplies of Newkama Land and thereafter wore a black shirt, a green scarf, dark grey slacks, and a black overcoat with brown tan (light color in the anime) fur trim. After the Summit War of Marineford, he is seen in attire that greatly resembles the one from the Arabasta Kingdom, consisting of a vest over a plain shirt, a scarf around his neck, suit pants, elegant shoes, and a fur coat draped around his shoulders. After the timeskip, his apparel continues to resemble his outfit during the Arabasta Arc, but with a vest that features diagonal crossing stripes rather than squares. In all his appearances, he wears a single gold hoop earring in his right ear, and he usually has several golden rings with different colored gemstones on every finger except the ring finger, for reasons unknown (in the anime version of the Arabasta Arc, it was his middle finger that was bare. This has since been corrected in recent arcs). In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Crocodile is shown having a similar hairstyle as his adult self, but is missing his trademark scar and hook. He is shown wearing simple clothing with a large pistol slung on his belt.", "personality": "Crocodile is a seasoned, cunning and business-savvy pirate who is self-assured and confident in himself and his own abilities, as evidenced by his former title as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea that he had held on for years. He enjoys toying with weaker opponents, often grinning and laughing smugly during battle. However, due to his overconfidence, he seriously underestimated Luffy's willpower, and this eventually led to his defeat. Crocodile is first introduced as an intimidating and sophisticated mastermind, although to the people of the Arabasta Kingdom, he was viewed as a savior figure who protected the country from pirate attacks, as part of his duty as a Warlord of the Sea. In spite of his status as a national hero, Crocodile could not care less for the local population and their adoration for him, looking down on them as fools and only acting against threats in order to keep up appearances. In his plot to take over Arabasta, Crocodile callously and inhumanly orchestrated the destruction of several communities, with the intent of inciting strife that would eventually lead into a bloody civil war. Crocodile's actions were enough to disgust even former bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro, who described the Warlord as the worst of scoundrels. Crocodile's willingness to kill shows his pitiless nature, and he does not think twice about sentencing another person to death. He is also very quick to get angry if someone insults or ridicules him in any way; Crocodile told Nico Robin that he had killed everyone who had ever insulted him. This irritability is first seen when Sanji sasses him over the Den Den Mushi. It is more clearly shown during his first fight with Luffy: when the Straw Hat captain called him stupid, he bit his cigar clean in half and then threatened to kill Robin for laughing. By his own admission, Crocodile is not always rational. Despite his low tolerance for receiving insults, Crocodile has the habit of taunting others, frequently using the word \"worthless\" to refer to the desperate struggles of his enemies, although he seems to have changed this habit slightly since fighting Luffy. Crocodile is known to belittle his foes, generally implying that they are far inferior to him, whether he is fighting a rookie or a fellow Warlord (namely Donquixote Doflamingo, who had a former bounty almost 300,000,000 higher than his own). Crocodile's capacity for looking down on others is so high that he even told Dracule Mihawk, the World's Strongest Swordsman, to \"watch himself\". In battle, Crocodile shows a complete lack of fear and doubt, although this trait was broken down a bit during his third battle with Luffy. He usually appears to be very composed and fearless, even when facing fearsome opponents like Whitebeard, Dracule Mihawk, or Akainu. If Crocodile is extremely angry or annoyed with his victim, he will rarely kill them outright, instead leaving them to suffer as they slowly die. This proved to be a bad habit, which ultimately led to his defeat. In his first and second fights with Luffy, instead of killing him straight away, Crocodile left Luffy to suffer. Because of this carelessness, Luffy was able to come back in two different occasions and finally defeat him. This, along with sheer luck, are the only reasons Luffy lived through any of his fights with Crocodile. This also allowed Mr. 3 to survive Crocodile's attempt to feed him to the Bananawani, which proved to be instrumental to the survival of the Straw Hats. Crocodile has displayed an extremely cynical and patronizing attitude, showing complete disregard to the romantic pirate lifestyle and stating that all the values that the status of Pirate King had once symbolized were now worthless to him. Crocodile valued military power above popularity, renown, and treasure, believing that only ignorant fools declare their grandiose dreams. He referred to having trust and faith in others as an idiotic thing to do several times during the Arabasta Arc, claiming to have done away with countless people and going as far as to deride those who fight for someone else, making their defeats all the harsher. Crocodile has been shown to almost completely lack any code of honor. Extremely pragmatic to the point of treachery, Crocodile once offered a sadistic choice to Vivi, only to later reveal that it would not matter in the end, making any effort from her part meaningless. One of the few vestiges of honor he ever displayed was in his third battle with Luffy, during which he stated that Luffy deserved an honorable death from his venomous hook. Due to the situation at the time of battle, this could be seen as more an ironic act of cruelty than honor, but he did seem to regard the use of his rarely seen poison hook as a tribute to Luffy's tenacity. As another example of his distorted sense of honor, after Whitebeard had been injured by Squard, Crocodile refused to fight him in that weakened state. In fact, he became furious at Whitebeard's loss of strength out of pride, having been defeated by the Emperor in the past. Crocodile shows no emotional concern for most of his subordinates, and they don't have any to him. He is fully willing to sacrifice them to achieve his ambitions; a prime example is Operation Utopia, wherein every Baroque Works member in Alubarna, including most of the Officer Agents, would have been killed by the resulting cannon blast. He also has no qualms about killing them if they fail or betray him, having little tolerance for anything that may threaten the outcome of his plans. He showed no true attachment, affection, or trust toward these people and viewed them only as pawns. Despite all this, Crocodile is very loyal to Daz Bones: He seems to have a very good relationship with Mr. 1, having gone out of his way to rescue his former subordinate from his cell. Daz in return is very loyal to his boss, even getting angry if someone disrespects him After being defeated by Luffy and being stripped of his Warlord title, Crocodile apparently lost interest in the outside world. He refused to escape with the rest of his subordinates during the breakout detailed in the eighth Cover Story. Upon his capture, he disregarded the notion of escaping simply because he did not feel like it, perhaps assuming that escape would come easily to him if he changed his mind. Similarly, he smiled at the news that he would be sent to Impel Down and seemed apathetic during his imprisonment. Crocodile was the only Impel Down inmate who appeared to be enjoying himself; he was initially seen smiling and mocking his fellow prisoners. He claimed that he was only in Impel Down because he chose to stay, an assertion well in line with his overly condescending demeanor. His only apparent motivation to leave Impel Down was the chance to enact revenge against Whitebeard. Following the war, Crocodile seemed eager to journey to the New World with Mr. 1, having reignited his ambitious side once more. Crocodile seems to have mellowed out since his defeat in Arabasta, at least to some degree. He seems more willing to assist others, having offered to aid Luffy escape from Impel Down, and he nonchalantly accepted help from others as well. Certain revelations imply that he may not be as heartless as he lets on. During the war, he went beyond his personal agenda several times to save his allies' lives. He saved Ace's life and protected Mr. 1 and Luffy from Mihawk. He even prevented Akainu from cornering Luffy and Jinbe as they desperately tried to escape the scene of the battle. Nevertheless, he claimed that he only saved them because if he had not, the Marines would feel victorious, and that prospect irritated him. Crocodile has a distinct laugh that starts with \"Ku\" (i.e., Kuhahahaha!). In the anime, he tends to laugh at a much slower pace than one might expect, his \"hahaha\"s lapsing into \"ah-ah-ah\"s on occasion.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a former Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile is powerful enough to be recognized by the World Government. He was the Warlord with the second lowest bounty at the time 81,000,000, with Hancock having the lowest, although he held the title for so long that such a low bounty would now be outdated. Currently, he now has the fifth highest after the former Warlords, Blackbeard, Mihawk, Buggy, and Law, with a bounty of 1,965,000,000, Indeed, when Crocodile was stripped of his Warlord status and transferred to Impel Down, he was placed in Level 6, where the world's absolute worst criminals are kept. He defeated Luffy no less than twice before his eventual defeat. In fact, if not for his good luck and the help he received from several people, Luffy would have been killed in all three battles: he was impaled (and then rescued by Nico Robin), dehydrated (and then revived by his own Water Water Pistol), and poisoned (and then received the antidote from Robin). Moreover, if Luffy's blood had not served as a way to nullify Crocodile's Logia-Type defense, and if Robin had not supplied Luffy with the antidote to his hook's poison, the third battle would have effectively favored Crocodile as well. Later on, during the Summit War of Marineford, Crocodile was uninjured after confronting fellow Warlords Donquixote Doflamingo and Dracule Mihawk in quick succession, despite the fact that both opponents possess and have complete mastery of their Haki. Against the latter, he did not seem to be concerned at all about facing the strongest swordsman in the world, even going so far as to threaten him. Crocodile was even able to battle Admiral Akainu and survive completely unharmed afterward. After time-skip, Crocodile became more powerful than before. He easily defeated Vice Admiral Stainless and his fleet. His bounty of 1,965,000,000 has made him an extremely dangerous threat to the World Government's operations. This is furthered by the fact that he and Mihawk merely becoming subordinates to Buggy was enough to get him named as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government. Crocodile is extremely intelligent and cunning, which is apparent from his ability to lead Baroque Works while keeping the World Government completely in the dark about what he was doing and making himself out to be a hero in the eyes of the people. He is also skilled at crafting near-flawless plans and noticing things that most other people would not. His intelligence and leadership are acknowledged by the Marines and recognized as two of his most dangerous traits, alongside his Logia abilities. He is known to deduce a correct conclusion based on very little information; for example, after seeing the white wrappings on the Straw Hats' arms, he almost instantly figured out that it was a safeguard against Mr. 2's infiltration. He managed to sabotage the king's reputation among the citizens by secretly importing rain-producing dust into the capital during a period of major regional drought, then having it \"accidentally\" discovered on route, inciting the threat of civil war and thereby drawing attention away from his own shady machinations. The entire Arabasta Saga is a testament to Crocodile's strategy and manipulative skills: he managed to successfully maintain control over all operations within \"Baroque Works\" over a period of years while keeping his true identity as a Warlord hidden from everyone except Nico Robin. Simultaneously, he strove to attain a high level of respect and prestige among the citizens of Arabasta as their \"savior\" by brutally dispatching any would-be invaders or pirates. An expert liar and manipulator, he was able to trick Vivi in wasting time looking for a key that was fake all along and managed to make Luffy drop his guard by targeting Yuba with a sandstorm, after learning of Luffy's friendship with Toto. During the events of Operation Utopia, Crocodile demonstrated great foresight in his attempt to blow up Alubarna, having installed a backup mechanism to fire a bomb on the capital in case the main method failed and placing two of his agents to protect it in the possibility it was found. His skills not only apply to his own organization but to others as well, as he was responsible for fellow warlord Buggy gaining the capital and resources needed to establish his own successful underworld organization, Buggy's Delivery. Later, with the help and influence of fellow Warlord Dracule Mihawk, and with Buggy offering to pay off his debt by offering up his organization, it was re-integrated into a much larger, more powerful, more dangerous Emperor-led organization, capable of issuing bounties on Marines, Cross Guild. In addition to that, Crocodile operates said organization alongside co-founder Mihawk, with Buggy, who was mistakenly given credit for Cross Guild's creation and made an Emperor as a result, now acting as the organization's figurehead, allowing the two to operate as they please while the world focuses mostly on him, with Buggy as their supposed leader, and the two ex-warlords acting as his chief officers and having their own respective reputations added into Cross Guild's rising infamy, with none the wiser of the organization's actual leadership. In addition, aside from being heavily experienced thanks to his many years as a pirate, he seems to have a better understanding of Devil Fruits than most people, as evidenced by his mastery of his Logia-type powers. He also revealed that the Jailer Beasts were actually \"Awakened\" Zoan fruit users at a time when no one around him had even realized that they were even Devil Fruit users. In addition to his powers being of the Logia-type, allowing him to turn into sand to avoid injuries, Crocodile has an enormous amount of physical stamina, durability, pain tolerance, resilience and endurance, coupled with remarkable speed and reflexes. He was able to take a heavy flurry of blows from Luffy in his third battle as he countered with his own attacks, and he took a Brilliant Punk from Jozu infused with Busoshoku Haki and was able to get up quickly, showing only superficial injuries. He is also one of the few people known to tolerate getting \"baptized\" in boiling water in Impel Down without flinching, which is considered an impressive feat. He could effortlessly withstand the extreme temperatures of Levels 3 (where the heat is sufficient to roast a bird alive), 4 (which is several times hotter than Level 3) and 5 (a room operating at sub-zero temperatures) of Impel Down. Crocodile also possesses great physical strength, first demonstrated when he carried off the dead bodies of an entire pirate crew (namely Puppu's) after dehydrating them with his Devil Fruit powers. He was able to block a Doflamingo kick, without too many complications (his shock created a wave strong enough to push away the nearby marines). He even managed to intercept and parry Mihawk's two-handed slash with just his hook Crocodile ate the Suna Suna no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into sand. This ability allows him to easily re-form his body after most attacks. While in a desert/sandy area, his powers make him nearly invincible. Crocodile has the ability to create huge sandstorms, make multiple bladed weapons out of sand, and create quicksand (given the presence of a nearby underground waterway). He can also create powerful sandstorms that grow in power until even Crocodile himself cannot stop them. He can absorb all the moisture out of any object, living or non-living, by touching it with his right hand. This ability allows him to utterly destroy his surroundings, killing and mummifying any biological substances via dehydration. This application does not work on metallic substances, though. However, if moisture comes into contact with his body, it immediately reverts to solid form and cannot transform. In addition to being one of the few characters shown to have some degree of mastery over their Devil Fruit, Crocodile is also formidable in hand-to-hand combat using a hook. He fought using only his hook for most of his third match with Luffy, only resorting to his Devil Fruit powers when he finally accepted that things weren't going in his favor. His hook is made mostly out of an extremely tough and resilient gold alloy, which makes it resistant to corrosion. Its durability was shown to be especially impressive when it took no visible damage from Mihawk's Yoru as Crocodile defended Luffy from an attack. The gold part of the hook is hollow and can be removed to expose a poisonous hook hidden inside. This porous secondary hook releases a powerful scorpion venom, which is strong enough to melt through rock and kill anyone with the effect of a single slash. In the unlikely event that the hook becomes damaged, there is a knife hidden underneath that can be ejected and used in its place. In a pinch, the very wide base of the hook can also serve as an improvised mace-like weapon, as shown when Crocodile used its blunt force to smash Luffy into a wall. During his incarceration in both a regular prison and Impel Down, Crocodile was permitted to keep his formidable hook. For the pinnacle of Operation Utopia, Crocodile prepared a specialized bomb. It was designed to detonate across a maximum radius of five kilometers, large enough to completely obliterate the capital city of Alubarna. It was prepared about 30 minutes prior to the intended firing time, at which point it would be released from a bulky cannon, but in case that method backfired, Crocodile had a special timer installed onto the bomb itself. The timer was set for less than a minute after the planned time."},

He has dark lips and circles around his eyes, and on his head is what appears to be a type of lizard that acts as his \"hair\", with the tail acting as a tuft, covering the right part of his face. He dons dark pants and shoes, and a lighter shirt with blood splatters on some parts near and on his neck (hence his nickname), with loose sleeves and ruffled edges, and what appears to be a Cross fleury onthechest. During his brother's cover story, Coribou appears to have changed to a similar shirt without sleeves. Caribou also appears to be constantly sweating.", "personality": "Coribou appears to be rather oblivious to the location of things around him. Whether this is because he is foolish, has bad eye sight, is too afraid to look at his brother, or just a peculiar habit is unknown. He was facing the wrong way when answering his brother about smearing the plaza with a Marine's blood. He is also rather obedient to Caribou's requests, as he immediately started digging a grave to bury the Marine alive upon his brother's orders without question and showing no signs of compassion or mercy. He has a habit of calling Caribou \"bro-bro\" (, anisuke?). He is also always very nervous, and is constantly stuttering and sweating, which could suggest he is afraid of his brother. In spite of this, he is nevertheless very loyal to Caribou, proven when he and the rest of their crew made the journey to a Marine base in order to rescue him, and even more so when they reunite after Caribou had abandoned his entire crew for his own safety, and Coribou remained affectionate towards him. This is because their Grandmother told them to get along, and it is implied that she punished them for fighting based on the bandages on their heads in Coribou's memory.", "abilities_and_powers": "Coribou is supposedly a fearsome pirate captain who, along with his brother, managed to reach Sabaody Archipelago, with their fame arising from killing Marines. He was strong enough to survive 3000 meters below sea level and somehow made it back to the surface alive and well. He carries around a shovel, which he apparently uses to dig the graves of the people whose his brother considers \"sinners\" when asked to do so. He also uses it as a melee weapon against the Marines of G-5 and to cut down the stake that Caribou was tied to. During his attempted attack against the Straw Hat Pirates, Coribou was seen carrying a hand-held Gatling gun. However, as his ship was attacked by the kraken before he had a chance to attack, his proficiency with the weapon and its firepower are not demonstrated. Coribou's gatling gun has a somewhat different design in the manga than in the anime."},

She has a similar hairstyle to Robin's (before the timeskip). Her nose is flat, similar to Robin's, but wider between the eyes, and longer. Cocoa wears a plain dark purple dress, carries a purse and bright red high heels. Fake Luffy has asserted her to be the closest in appearance to her duplicate out of the crew; in spite of this, Cocoa has virtually no resemblance to Robin.", "personality": "Compared to the real Robin, Cocoa is not very bright as she apparently did not take into account the dangers of impersonating someone who has many enemies. However, she is more intelligent than Black, as she quickly identified Chopper. She also appears to be a very cruel woman as shown when she brutally kicked Nora Gitsune away after deciding to discard him. She did show a kinder side by offering Chopper food and offering to take him in.

He allowed her to read the books in the library, study history, and happily graduated her into archeology. He forbade her from studying the forbidden poneglyphs only to protect her from the World Government's wrath. When he learned about her ability to read the poneglyphs, he regretted not knowing despite watching over her or being able to do more for her in order to not make her feel alienated as a result. When Olvia and Robin were forced to separate again, Clover shed a tear for the mother and daughter.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a scholar from Ohara, Professor Clover had the skills to read Poneglyphs, thus being one of the few people with the ability to discover the truth about the Void Century, and the exact locations of the ancient weapons. As a leading professor of archaeology, he had immense knowledge of history, including the secret events of the Void Century.

He also carried a fuzzy staff with a tribal mask on top.", "personality": "Coburn was depicted as wise and reasonable compared to the rest of his tribe, willing to overlook heresy towards his culture if he thought it would be for the benefit of the Shandia. Even though Mont Blanc Noland ended up killing Kashigami, considered a sacrilegious act by the Shandia, Coburn gave Noland a chance to find medicine to save his tribe in exchange for the lives of his crewmates, being intent in keeping his word despite pressure from the other Shandia, as he had acknowledged Noland's wisdom.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the ancient Shandia tribe, Coburn was responsible of making decisions that concerned his tribe.

On her left shoulder she has the same tattoo as Nami. She also wears black high heels. In the One Piece premiere 2012, she wore a pink skirt and pink high heels.", "personality": "As with the rest of her crew, Chocolat uses the reputation of the real Straw Hats to intimidate others.

Chocolat shows more of a kinder side as she begged Caribou to release Drip and showed concern when he was released.", "abilities_and_powers": "Like the rest of her crew, Chocolat apparently has no fighting capabilities, which is typical for a fraud. It was obvious that she had a weak will as she easily fainted from Luffy's Haki. Another sign of her weakness was that she was captured and easily brought to her knees by the Caribou Pirates.

Furthermore, Choco Police has a strong sense of duty as he was furious when he discovered Luffy and Chopper committing snackalism.

He is a large human, about twice as tall as most humans but still not as tall as the late Edward Newgate. He is bald, with a dent on the crown of his head, and has the number \"12\" tattooed on his left temple representing that he was the 12th leader of the Happo Navy. Chinjao sports a pale green shirt with white linings, that shows his chest and round belly. He also wears dark yellow pants. Although Chinjao's expression is usually calm and serene-looking, his expression changes to a fiercer look when enraged, with his facial hair waving upwards. In his youth, he wore a long, buttoned, blue-colored shirt, with light green circle patterns and a yellow, grey captain's coat draped on his shoulders. He had a long pointed head, which gave him his epithet \"the Drill\". However, after a punch from Garp, his head was forced into its dented appearance. A glancing punch from Luffy later reverted it to normal. Not long after that though, a kick from his grandson, Sai, bent it. While under the effects of the Hobi Hobi no Mi, he appears as a Santa Claus-like doll. At Sai's wedding, he wore a bowtie and a mantle.", "personality": "He seems to be a quiet and calm person, as he did not react to Luffy defeating Spartan. He is quite perceptive as, unlike many people in the Colosseum, he saw through Luffy's disguise. His immense presence, imposing nature lead to him having a serious, solemn demeanor. Chinjao carries a great deal of pride for his own abnormal head; which gave Chinjao the capacity to hold an enormous grudge against Garp for shrinking it. His grudge would even carry over to a child whom he claims would inherit their parent's sin, as he wanted Luffy to pay for his grandfather Garp's actions, and even commented on how he would have killed Dragon if he knew that he was Garp's son sooner. Despite his grudge, he is at least able to maintain civility by addressing his enemies with an honorific suffix. However, this is short-lived as he can enter into a violent rage at the prospect of Garp's bloodline being near him. Despite being incredibly vengeful, he is also immensely grateful to those who do him favors. After Luffy returned Chinjao's pointed head, Chinjao's grudge has ceased to exist. He also holds younger pirates like the Worst Generation in low regard, going so far as to praise the Marines for cleansing the demonic blood of Roger two years ago, thereby pulling the sprout that showed the most potential as a pirate. He always seems confident in his own fighting capabilities. During his fight with Garp, he believed that the Marine would end up losing his fist. At the Corrida Colosseum, he did not think highly of Luffy during their battle despite the pirate's reputation and believed that he will succeed in killing the Straw Hat captain. Prior to losing to Garp, Chinjao seems to be somewhat merciful, having ordered his men to simply round up the thieves attempting to steal his treasure and then sendthem drifting across the sea. He still addresses his enemies with an honorific suffix and politeness in civil conversations, such as knocking out some of the competitors in Block C while letting them off by knocking them out with Haoshoku Haki. However, Chinjao happens to be rather brutal in combat, as he knocked away numerous competitors to get to Luffy in Block C. Unlike Sai, he would even allow Baby 5 to commit suicide given a misunderstanding between her and Sai, going as far as to try preventing him from saving her life and attempting to take both their lives after Sai continued to do so. Chinjao is proud of the Happo Navy and his family. He would expand his military power through an arranged marriage between Sai and the daughter of the leader of the Niho Navy. When Sai was preventing Baby 5 from committing suicide, Chinjao declared him to be a disgrace to the navy and the family. However, after Sai bent his pointed head, Chinjao cried in joy over his grandson's power instead of getting angry, showing affection and gratitude of his family's strength, as he would call off the arranged wedding and declared that he would give his title of \"Don\" to Sai. Like most notable characters, he has a unique laugh: \"Hiyahoho\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Chinjao Family, he has complete control over them. He was a known enemy of the famous Marine, Vice Admiral Garp, enforcing a good deal of power.Chinjao and Garp fought for many times, and Garp destroyed eight mountains as a training to prepare for their last battle. Since he is a former commander of the Happo Navy he has access to their techniques as he used them quite well in battle. In his golden age, when he was still a pirate, he was considered a rival to both Garp And Gol D. Roger, and had a bounty of 542,000,000. However, the bystanders watching him attack Luffy implied that he may have weakened with age. A battle with Garp caused his head to be flattened and diminished his power while he was still in his prime.Sometime, following his fight with Monkey D. Luffy,he reveals to Sai that his illness has worsened since their clash, which, along with his old age, has further depleted his strength. His losses to his grandchild and then to Lao G are actually attributions precisely to this factor; also the latter had to use all his power and a surprise attack. Chinjao was an extremely powerful master of Hasshoken in his prime. He personally emphasized vibration enhanced punches and prominently headbutts. Before his head was flattened by Garp, his headbutts were powerful enough to split the immensely hard Ice Continent in two, courtesy of his drill-shaped head that allowed him to concentrate all of his strength into that point. Upon Luffy's strike restoring Chinjao's head to its old, pointed shape, his legendary strength from thirty years ago was restored, enabling him to split the Corrida Colosseum's arena simply by falling onto it head first.Even something as simple as bowing his head in gratitude can split the ground in front of Chinjao. However, his head was later bent by Sai, and it is unknown if he can fully use it again. Even with his head blunted, Chinjao can easily destroy rocks and block swords with his head alone. He is very fast, to the point that he deliver a barrage of headbutts that leaves afterimages, much like Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gatling technique. He can easily keep up with Luffy's Gear Second enhanced speed in combat. Even in his old age, Chinjao remained physically powerful, able to bring down multiple powerful gladiators with his bare hands. He easily defeated Ideo, a boxing champion,with one swift strike. He also managed to hold his own against Luffy, a powerful fighter, in a fist fight. Finally, Chinjao is extremely durable, as he slightly bent Cavendish's \"legendary sword\" Durandal with the force of his head alone without his skin getting pierced, and got up quickly and unscathed after receiving a Jet Pistol to the back of the head.. He took several of Jean Ango's thrown weapons to the belly without any serious injuries, though it did cause him some bleeding and pain, while also acting in a manner similar to rubber, in that he bounced the weapons that hit him in the stomach and not long afterwards he reached full recovery with no permanent damage done. He also has enormous stamina to match his durability, as even being weakened beforehand, he took on Sai, and although Sai managed to tilt his head effortlessly, he got up without much difficulty, then quickly recovered from a powerful attack from a Lao G empowered. Later, he was attacked by the merciless assault of Pica's Charles Stone and even with his previous injuries he was back on his feet in an instant. Chinjao is one of the very small number of people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. Chinjao possesses the ability to use Haoshoku Haki. He knocked out many of the competitors in Block C without laying a finger on them, an impressive feat considering that most of the participants in the Corrida Colosseum are strong fighters. In a clash with Luffy, their Haki enhanced strikes resulted in the air itself crackling. Chinjao is highly proficient in Busoshoku Haki, which he uses to harden his fist to augment the force of his punch and clash evenly with Luffy, an expert Busoushoku Haki user. He prominently uses it to harden his head in order to split open the Jewel Ice Sheet. He can also use Haki to harden parts of his body like his belly to defend himself from direct attacks.

Like Arlong and the rest of his crew, he strongly looks down on humans, seeing them as an inferior species to the Fish-Men.

{"name": "Charlotte Pudding", "episode": "Episode 651", "chapter": "Chapter 571", "year": 2012, "note": "Her name was first mentioned by Capone Bege in Chapter 812. She was first identified in Chapter 850.", "appearance": "Pudding is a teenage girl with round, reddish brown eyes (blue in the manga), and prominent lips. She is somewhat short, shown to be about one head shorter than Sanji (who is 180cm) when standing directly in front of him. She has light brown hair styled with pigtails in the back and side-swept bangs in the front. Her most defining feature is her third eye on her forehead, which is usually covered by her bangs. As a child, she had shorter hair tied in two pigtails. She wore a pink dress with a floral pattern, and later a red dress with a white-colored collar. In her first appearance in the Fish-Man Island Arc, her hair was styled slightly differently, being tied into a single ponytail on the top of her head and lacking her bangs, exposing her third eye. She wore a revealing pink blouse along with an orange corset, puffy red pants, red suspenders, and matching red shoes. In the photograph of her that Vito showed Sanji, she wore a blue outfit decorated with a floral pattern. When she first encountered the Sanji Retrieval Team at Cacao Island, she wore a frilly light-purple top with a pink stripe down the middle and puffy, light-purple pants. While she was at a bridal store in Sweet City, she wore a light-purple dress. At the Whole Cake Chateau prior to the wedding, she wore a light pink dress. During her \"wedding\" with Sanji, she wore a white bridal outfit with roses on both side on her hair. When she returned to Cacao Island to make the substitute wedding cake, Pudding changed her outfit into a chef's attire, which includes a chef's hat and an apron. Her chef outfit has a knee-length dark-colored skirt. When she parted ways with Sanji, Pudding wears a cloak.", "personality": "As a child, Pudding was abused and ridiculed because of her third eye. Under her mother's rule, she decided to cover her eye with her hair, which escalated to hiding more aspects of herself. Linlin's tyranny made Pudding feel like her mother's puppet, and she was unable to go against her orders, despite internally resenting her. In truth, Pudding is very timid, sensitive, and frightful, which she flawlessly hid with her superior acting skills. She actually possesses a strong inferiority complex concerning her third eye, planted by the mocking of children during her youth, and her own mother's tactless and mean comments. When Sanji became the first person in her life to say anything nice about her third eye, Pudding became emotional and even broke down in genuine tears, showing her true personality and preventing her from following her mother's instructions to kill Sanji. Although she attempted to kill Sanji (even after he saved her life) while admitting about her true nature and that she had deceived him, Sanji surmised that Pudding was deceiving herself as much as she was deceiving others. Having been touched by Sanji's kindness, Pudding developed a genuine romantic fixation on Sanji and an 'erratic personality disorder' centered around him, which can best be described as an extreme form of tsundere. Her moods rapidly switches between her dishonest 'tsun' half, in which she openly and seemingly happily scorns Sanji (and those associated with him), to her loving 'dere' half, where she would blush and act affectionately towards him. This dichotomy of emotions confuses even Pudding, as she wonders aloud why she behaves the way she does after her emotions take hold. Whenever she watches Sanji do something incredible, Pudding blushes heavily, even getting a nosebleed herself as seen when witnessing Sanji kick her brother Oven aside. She even has developed a genuine care for Sanji's interests, as she showed concern for Luffy after hearing about his fight with Charlotte Katakuri and for Chiffon when Oven threatened her life. Thanks to her acting skills, Pudding created a mask of a vicious and cruel person. As part of her mother's plan to assassinate the entire Vinsmoke Family, Pudding deceived Sanji into believing she loved him, taking advantage of his attraction towards her as well as his own vulnerable state of mind (caused by her family taking his friends and Zeff hostage). She also successfully deceived the Straw Hats who had come to retrieve Sanji, convincing them that she would release Sanji from their arranged marriage and help them reunite with him. As part of her act, she also mocks and insults her enemies, and will simply ignore efforts to insult her back. She showed a great degree of sadism as she enjoys torturing her opponents with the horrific truth as soon as she believes she can get away with it, which is made easier by her ability to manipulate memories. Believing people would hate her, Pudding often reveals her third eye when playing this character. Pudding seems to find her image and popularity as a \"good girl\" important and wishes to keep it up. She is willing to put a lot of effort into erasing and manipulating everyone's memories to keep them from finding out her evil personality, although she wishes there was a simpler way with less work. As part of her act, Pudding appears to be a misandrist and shallow girl, with a low opinion on men, believing they are easily duped by her crocodile tears, and held Sanji's love-filled confession in low regard, treating it as though it was a joke. Pudding also vocally expressed her disgust at Sanji's swollen face, degrading it as ugly and unlovable, and considers him unworthy of being a proper prince. She also does not like perverted behavior being directed towards her by people she does not care for, as she becomes filled with rage and disgust when Sanji has a nosebleed after she pretends to entice him, to the point where she is overwhelmed with a stronger urge to kill him. Away from her family, Pudding shows another personality, more closely resembling to her true self. When Pudding was first introduced, she appeared to be a benevolent and kind girl to others. She seemed to have truly loved Sanji and wanted to marry him, but understood his wishes of wanting to return to his crew, and was even willing to help his crewmates rescue him. Upon realizing he was already imprisoned by Big Mom's shackles and having no one left to rely on, she swore that she would not let the marriage be hell for him. This kind personality is often used to lure her victims into trusting her.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Pudding holds authority over lower-ranking members of her crew. As a half-member of the Three-Eye Tribe, Pudding may also be capable of awakening a true power that will allow her to decipher the text on the poneglyphs, although she has stated that she may be unable to due to her mixed heritage. She also intends to use her third eye as a means of a psychological attack, shocking Sanji with it during the wedding in order to create an opening for her to shoot him. Pudding possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and stay conscious from her loud screams. Strength-wise, Pudding appears nowhere near the level of most of her siblings. However, she seems to have enough strength in her arms to harm individuals whose bodies had been modified to withstand heavy damage. She also has extremely sharp eye sight as she could tell it was Sanji who kicked her brother Oven aside even when Sanji was moving so fast that no else noticed. Pudding is a master of deceit, being an extremely skilled and talented actress with a specialty in drama and enticement, with Big Mom thinking highly of her ability and doting on her because of it. Before selective targets as much as in public, Pudding can unerringly adopt the personality traits of a wholly kind, gentle, and innocent woman in vast contrast to her true self, fooling nearly anyone she wants into utter manipulation, including the citizenry of Totto Land at large and some of the Straw Hats, such as Luffy and the smart, mindful Nami and Sanji (despite Luffy's and Sanji's aptitude in Kenbunshoku Haki, to the point where said three were utterly befuddled upon learning the truth); supposedly only her family is aware of Pudding's true nature. A master seductress, she uses her beauty in conjunction with such feigned persona to captivate men, particularly shown with Sanji and Brook who were completely charmed by her (as opposed to Pedro, who was not but is noted to be excessively cautious toward any stranger). More specifically, Pudding can cry at will and has a knack for making overly dramatic expressions, like when she comically mimicked Sanji in ways that Nitro and Rabiyan noted were absolutely spot on. However, it would seem that it takes a lot of effort for Pudding to pull of her acts. She would require moments of when she could let loose her true emotions to others, such as when she sadistically revealed her true colors to Reiju when she began to investigate her, but only because she could use her Devil Fruit ability to wipe out her memory of it. Also, periods of great shock and emotion can disrupt her ability to fool others, such as when she was surprised and saddened when Sanji became the first person to ever compliment her third eye. And according to Sanji, of all the people Pudding had fooled with her acts, she deceived herself the most by convincing herself that she was a heartless monster with no true feelings for anyone else and nothing-else. Pudding is also an extremely talented chocolatier, as both Luffy and Chopper find the chocolate biscuits with jam fillings that formed her caf to be irresistible. According to herself, it is a newly-made recipe of milk, beet sugar, and cocoa butter with texture tender to the point of melting in the mouth. Her chocolate ganache is so smooth, it would slide up and out of the pot if the pots lid isnt covering it. Pudding claims that her skill in making chocolate confectionery is superior to even the head chef of the Big Mom Pirates himself, Streusen, who is known as the finest chef in Totto Land. It was due to her skill that she was requested to succeed Lola as the Minister of Chocolate. Pudding also has cartographic skills. She was shown to be able to draw a map from her memory and give navigation instructions to the Sanji Retrieval Team on Cacao Island. Furthermore, she displayed knowledge of the New World navigation method with a Log Pose. Pudding's primary combat skills lies in marksmanship. She is skilled enough in wielding a special revolver to accurately shoot Reiju, a commander of Germa 66, in the leg. However, her skills are still limited as she could not land a hit on Sanji, an extremely skilled Kenbunshoku Haki user, even at point-blank range. Pudding ate the Memo Memo no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to manipulate memories. She can reach into a person's head and extract memories in the form of film strips. With this power, she can afford to reveal her true intentions and motives to her enemies without compromising the plan, as well as manipulate people into doing what she wants without them asking questions. She can cut away frames to remove specific memories from a person's mind. She can then paste on new frames to add new memories, which can take the place of the removed memories. She keeps various memory frames stored in her room, so she can add them to other people's memories when she needs to. She can also stimulate peoples old memories, thus distracting them from the current situation. She can even use this power on Homies, in which case, they remember the memories from the people whom their souls originally belonged to. Pudding uses a Walker .36 Caliber Percussion revolver which is loaded with Candy Jacket bullets with extraordinary percussive power, able to penetrate the armored skeletons of the Vinsmokes. Pudding intended to use it to kill Sanji during the exchange of vows, but her skills proved to be limited as Sanji was able to dodge all of her shots, from point-blank range, using haki. Pudding picked up a kitchen knife in her cafe when she felt threatened by the Sanji Retrieval Team, waving it in \"self-defense\". As a child, she also used a knife to get revenge on some bullies, stabbing one of them and then chasing down the others."},

Smoothie wears a pink striped leotard, a large yellow scarf that flows nearly to the ground, sleeves around her elbows, a huge floppy cap resembling an oversized beret (although she was not seen wearing it during the Tea Party) and a pair of long dark boots that reach up to her knees with decorative adornments at the top. She also has a tattoo of a rose on her upper right leg.", "personality": "Smoothie approaches things with a carefree attitude. She will agree to help crewmates if she has the time but tends not to display any investment into the tasks she does take on; however she will be remorseful for failing said tasks. Though she may be nonchalant most of the time, Smoothie can get very serious should circumstances require it and will waste no time in creating tactics to smooth out a given problem in the most efficient way possible. She is also perceptive on other people's nature and will make decisions based on how someone might react, as shown when she neglected to tell Big Mom about the prisoner revolt in Whole Cake Chateau due to knowing that her mother would fly into a rage nobody would want to deal with. She also quickly realized that Katakuri was disturbed and asked him if something was wrong after he foresaw Pudding crying. Smoothie has a very cruel side too her as well, as she likes to squeeze the life out of subordinates, even when being pleaded with to stop, and enjoys drinking the liquid produced while callously dropping dried-out bodies aside, treating them as sources of liquid rather than people. This is further shown when she hung a woman from a rope, along with a giraffe and a volcanic rock, using them as drink dispensers. During special occasions, such as Big Mom's Tea Party, Smoothie can be friendly and polite, greeting the guests and warmly offering them drinks. In spite of her cruelty and carefreeness, Smoothie is very loyal to her family and crew, as she will execute any assignment given to her by those she respects. When it comes to situations that will surely make her mother angry, Smoothie will take it upon herself to save her from unnecessary trouble, as she did not report the breakout at the Prisoner Library. She also cares deeply for her family and crew, as she was shocked when Capone Bege was about to assassinate her mother, and warned her siblings and crewmates on Big Mom going on another rampage in Sweet City. Like Oven, Galette, and Brle, Smoothie detests traitors, as she got furious at Bege and his crew in their attempt to assassinate their mother and at Jinbe for joining and aiding the Straw Hats. Smoothie appears to be confident in her abilities. Similar to Katakuri, she does not appear to brag about her power and deals with problems efficiently. When Perospero contacted her to bring down the Thousand Sunny, Smoothie commented that he should have let her handle the situation from the start. Smoothie can be a bit reckless, seen when she made herself bigger in an attempt to sink the Thousand Sunny at the risk of sinking her own ship. She also has the utmost pride in her crew, as Smoothie was in disbelief that she and her crew were taken lightly after Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom failed, and when Bege's fortress was under attack by Big Mom, she expressed her intention to torture the Fire Tank and Straw Hat Pirates to set up an example for others if they underestimate them. Smoothie usually keeps her composure during battle and other frantic situations, as she only commented that Reiju was \"trouble\" after being poisoned by her. The only time Smoothie tends to lose her composure completely is when her mother goes on a rampage due to her cravings. During such instances, Smoothie has been seen in panic and screaming to her siblings to run while fleeing from her rampaging mother. Although she is a hybrid, Smoothie shares her paternal heritage by exposing and decorating her long legs.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates, Smoothie's authority within the crew is second only to her mother. As the Minister of Juice, Smoothie has authority over 100% Island in Totto Land. Vito noted Smoothie as a \"monster\" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing her to Katakuri. Her bounty of 932,000,000 suggests that the World Government considers her extremely dangerous. Given her title of Sweet Commander, it is likely that she is stronger than her very powerful brothers, Compote, Daifuku, Oven and Perospero. Together with Daifuku and Galette, she managed to subdue Sanji, Reiju and Luffy, although the latter was heavily weakened. Smoothie has a considerable amount of leadership and tactical skill, and can quickly come up with plans for her forces to trap and kill enemies. She is shown to have a strong will, as she was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki. Smoothie possesses an extremely high level of physical strength befitting her size, being able to pick up, with one hand, and with both hands squeeze out a normal-sized person using her ability without effort. She also managed to squeeze a giraffe in a similar fashion with one grip. The anime shows her possessing enough strength to send Vinsmoke Reiju flying back. She has considerable durability, as she was able to resist a powerful kick from Vinsmoke Reiju without being forced back. In the anime, she was also able to easily block several attacks from Chopper's Kung-Fu Point. Being a hybrid of the Longleg Tribe, it can be assumed she has powerful legs. Smoothie ate the Shibo Shibo no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to drain liquid from both living and non-living things. She uses her power by twisting her target and wringing it out like a soaked cloth, though she can also drain liquid from a target by cutting it with her sword. She can squeeze the liquid out of anything, including animals, people, and even substances that would normally be too dangerous to touch, such as lava. Notably, the extracted liquid can be consumed like juice and seems to have an exquisite taste. She can wring the juice out of a person, leaving them severely dehydrated. Aside from the loss of liquid, their body being twisted during the wringing process does not cause the victim any damage. She can also use her power to wring harmful substances, such as poison, out of a person's body, including her own. Smoothie is also able to absorb the extracted liquid into herself, allowing her to make herself and her weapons much bigger and stronger. Once her body is filled with liquid, she can release the absorbed liquid in powerful concentrated blasts, as seen when she used her sword to send a large flying blast of liquid towards the Thousand Sunny. Smoothie carries a large sword on her back, with its sheath shaped like a drill bit. She can combine it with her Devil Fruit ability to drain liquid from any opponents she cuts with it and absorb liquid into it to increase its size and then unleash it as massive flying blasts. She has shown to possess considerable swordsmanship skills, using it to deflect cannon fire. The anime shows her possessing enough skill to clash with Vinsmoke Ichiji and Reiju. Smoothie possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

Noisette possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream. For use in assassinating the Vinsmoke Family, he and other members of the Big Mom Pirates were given Walkers.

{"name": "Charlotte Perospero", "episode": "Episode 834", "chapter": "Chapter 795", "year": 2016, "note": "", "appearance": "Perospero is a very tall and slim man with brown eyes, a pointed nose, pink lips, and a very long, thick tongue. He is often seen smiling, but on rare occasions, such as when his mother threatened him, his smile changes into that of a horrified expression. He wears a long, yellow coat with a tall lighter colored collar and the top buttons resembling large, purple and pink striped pieces of wrapped candy. The bottom of his coat has a checkered design and large beads along the hem. There is a dark-colored beaded bracelet on each wrist and his long sharp fingernails are painted dark. His large, orange and red striped hat has rainbow-colored lollipops along its rim and a large, pale pink plume. Something large and navy blue with baby blue polka-dots comes out from under his hat and curves upward on either side. His shoes have a long tip spiraling inward. He carries large magenta and pink candy cane with a curled top which he often licks. After he was engulfed in a massive explosion caused by Pedro, Perospero lost his right arm which he replaced with a candy prosthesis via his Devil Fruit ability. This artificial arm was shredded by Nekomamushi during their last fight. Five years ago, as he was escorting Pedro out of Totto Land, Perospero wore a coat similar to his current one but of a darker color. As a child, Perospero wore a pair of orange and white striped pants, brown and white dress shoes, a much smaller hat lacking the lollipops, and a coat similar to his current one, but with a less elaborate bottom.", "personality": "Perospero is extremely sadistic, taking great joy in tormenting others, such as when he threatened Caesar Clown with the prospect of being turned into candy and licked to death while also squeezing his heart for fun, as well as when he mocked a sobbing Vinsmoke Judge once the latter realized Big Mom's treachery. Perospero is not without fear, as he became terrified when his own mother threatened to kill him if she discovered that he was lying about the Straw Hats stealing a spare cake that was made for the wedding ceremony. He also became greatly shocked when Pedro was about to blow both of them up with explosions. He can also be vindictive, as after his right arm was severed by an explosion caused by Pedro, Perospero swore to make the Sanji Retrieval Team suffer for Pedro's actions. Perospero is also unreasonable and selfish, as he blamed Sanji for defiantly not dying during the Tea Party for the sake of his mother's plan to steal Germa cloning technology, believing that innocent people should willingly be killed for his mother's tyrannical ambition.However, he also possesses quite a strong will and tenacity, as he was not dissuaded from pursuing the Straw Hats even after losing said arm. Like his mother, he has a strong fondness for sweets, demonstrated when he gluttonously licked a giant candy cane while introducing Caesar to his new laboratory. When he lost his arm, his main complaint about it was that his candy arm replacement would melt whenever he drank tea. He refers to people he is fond of as candy, calling them \"sweet\" as he referred to Nami as a sweet \"candy girl\". Despite his cruel tendencies, Perospero has also demonstrated a strong care for the well being of Totto Land and its citizens, as he was willing to risk his own life and lie to his crazed mother to keep her from rampaging within Sweet City. He is shown to have some leniency, as he offered Brook and Chopper a chance to escape after assuming that Big Mom dealt a fatal blow to their friends. He appears to be very affectionate and kind towards children as shown when he told a group of little children to be nice with each other as he offered them lollipops and allowed them to eat the candy escalator he made with his power. He seems to care for his siblings since he angrily demanded Luffy to unhand his sister Brle after she pleaded with Perospero to save her. Similar to most of his siblings, he is very arrogant and prone to underestimating foes as seen when he considered it impossible for the Straw Hats to escape from Big Mom alive as he taunted Brook and Chopper about their friends' presumed demise while watching them fight his soldiers. This was shown again when the rest of the team arrived. He was surprised at their survival before regaining his composure and boasted that Luffy could not destroy his candy iron maiden but was surprised when he did. He was like this when the Straw Hats were presumed to have been washed away by Big Mom's tidal wave only be to be shocked and baffled when he learned of their continued survival. Perospero's arrogance makes him have a need to constantly toy with his enemies and either taunt or gloat to them whenever he has the upper hand. As rather than just finish his enemies off when given the chance, Perospero sadistically toys with them as long as possible. This attitude has cost him on several occasions, such as the Vinsmokes being able to escape from his trap despite having them dead to rights, losing his right arm in Pedro's sacrifice despite having pinned him down and being defeated by Nekomamushi on Onigashima because of his need to gloat to his enemies. He is also very proud of his bounty, as he was shown boasting about it to Pedro after he subdued him. He also believes that the birth order in the family matters as he claimed that he should be captain of the Big Mom Pirates if anything happens to Big Mom. He has a tendency to use the verbal tic, \"Perorin\" (?, \"Lickity\" in the English Dub), at the beginning or end of his sentences. Like many other characters, he has a unique laugh: \"Kukukuku\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer in the Big Mom Pirates, Perospero holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members, and as the Minister of Candy, he has authority over Candy Island in Totto Land. Besides, as befits his eldest son status, he was seen to be in charge of several of his other siblings in carrying out the massacre of the Vinsmoke Family at the tea party,and directing them as they chase their enemies down. Even Smoothie, a Sweet Commander, decided to follow his orders. As proof of his power and dangerousness, it is of what his bounty of 700,000,000 surpasses that of Snack, despite the fact that the latter was one of the Sweet Commander in the past. Vito noted Perospero as one of the \"monsters\" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing him to his younger Sweet Commander siblings Katakuri and Smoothie. Caesar Clown, an infamous criminal with a bounty of 300,000,000, was terrified of Perospero when the latter threatened him. Perospero easily subdued Brook and Chopper, and then defeated Pedro, one of the most powerful minks, without any problem. During the Raid on Onigashima, he also defeated Wanda and Carrot simultaneously despite having transformed into sulongs for part of the match, and faced off against Nekomamushi himself, where the mink was overwhelmed by the pirate, until he regained his sulong form, and went on to defeat him with one decisive blow. It is seen that his will is strong enough to withstand Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki. Perospero has proven to be extremely crafty. When his mother's original plan to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family went wrong due to Pudding's mistake and Luffy's interference, Perospero came up with an improvised and effective strategy on the spot by binding the Vinsmoke Family with his candy, leaving them at the mercy of his siblings as they prepared to shoot them to death, a plan that would have succeeded had it not been for Big Mom's unexpected scream that incapacitated all those at the Tea Party. When Big Mom began rampaging in Sweet City due to her craving for wedding cake, Perospero came up with a effective though dangerous lie that tricked his mother into going after the Straw Hats, temporarily sparing Sweet City from further destruction.Despite his strengths, Perospero has a bad habit of toying with his enemies rather than finish them off when given the chance, a flaw that cost him both his right arm, and his defeat at the hands of Nekomamushi. Perospero possesses fast reflexes, as he managed to spot and block Pedro's attack on him despite Pedro's speed, and had enough strength to pin the mink to the ground while counterattacking. In spite of his skinny frame, he possesses extraordinary endurance, as he took a punch from Vinsmoke Ichiji, a genetically-enhanced fighter with superhuman strength who had equipped his Raid Suit, and shrugged it off nonchalantly with a simple bruise on his face. When he was engulfed in a massive point-blank explosion caused by Pedro, he survived and managed to get back on his feet, although he still suffered grievous injuries and lost his right arm (he was also using his candy armor at the time). Even without any treatment, he quickly recovered enough from his injuries to aid his mother in pursuing the Thousand Sunny for several hours without tiring. However, he did become weakened after leaving his wounds untreated for hours. Perospero ate the Pero Pero no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and control candy. His candy can be in a gooey syrup form or hardened into a solid state. His power is incredibly versatile, as he can create anything out of candy. He is a highly talented candy craftsman and can use his candy to create anything; by spreading globs of candy, he can create hardened candy constructs that can be used for attack, defense, and support. He can shape his candy into weapons, even a giant candy iron maiden. He can also use candy to create protective walls and armor to defend himself with. By creating a mobile mass of candy that never dissolves, Perospero can travel across water. He can even create mechanical structures, such as an intricate candy escalator. At his mother's request, he was even able to construct a fully functional exact replica of Caesar's highly advanced laboratory from Punk Hazard out of candy. He can also use candy to bind and immobilize his opponents, being strong enough to hold down even the genetically-enhanced children of the Vinsmoke Family and Capone Bege's giant castle form. Perospero can even go as far as turning people into candy by covering them in it and causing it to seep into their bodies, killing them minutes after he immobilizes them with no chance for them to escape in the meantime. Perospero often uses his Devil Fruit ability to create candy weapons. He can use his candy cane staff to block sword strikes without it taking damage. He has also created a candy bow to fire volleys of candy arrows, as well as a candy axe. Perospero possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

His legs are extremely small in comparison to the rest of his body.", "personality": "Opera seems to be analytical, as he deduced that Luffy must be nearby upon finding the defeated Cracker. He cares for his family as well as the well-being of Sweet City, as he attempted to stop Big Mom from attacking Moscato during her rampage and was shocked to see the defeated Cracker. He also has a tendency to treat serious matters with a nonchalant attitude, so long as they do not affect him, as shown when he prepared to torture Nami with only a plain expression on his face. Opera is cowardly and cared for his self-preservation, as he made up stories about Luffy's and Nami's death in order to avoid severe punishment for failing to guard them. He has a habit of adding the suffix \"-fa\" (?) to the end of his sentences. He possesses a distinct way of laughing: \"Fafafa\" (, Fafafa?), which is based on the suffix he adds at the end of his sentences.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Minister of Whipped Cream, Opera has authority over Noko Island, and as an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, he has authority over lower-ranking members of his crew. Because of his large size, he has considerable physical strength, as he was able to easily pick up a young boy with one hand. Opera ate the Kuri Kuri no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and manipulate cream. His fruit is able to raise the heat of the sugar within the cream, to the point of burning off flesh merely by touching it. When he prepared to torture Nami, Opera wielded a crossbow."},

Furthermore, this would display his brutal nature in that he had no qualms about killing others for the benefit of his family. Likewise, his invasion of the Germa Kingdom with his 10,000 men army shows that he is ruthless and willing to destroy all those that stand in the way of the Big Mom Pirates.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Minister of Transport, Nusstorte has direct authority over Package Island.

Both Charlotte Mont-d'Or and Charlotte Oven were certain that Nusstorte would be successful in stealing their cloning technology, but, in reality, he was not strong enough to defeat the Vinsmoke Family. Nusstorte generally wields a large cutlass. During the siege on the Big Father Castle, he also carried a Walker, in which he used it to fire at his enemies. The following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.

{"name": "Charlotte Oven", "episode": "Episode 861", "chapter": "Chapter 827", "year": 2017, "note": "", "appearance": "Oven is an extremely large and muscular man, towering over Pedro, who himself is quite tall. He has a very thick neck, and hair that is arranged into three curved sections, as well as a short, spiky beard. His hair color is a gradient that resembles something being baked, starting out blond and turning into a dark orange, and his skin has a light pink tint. He wears a high-collared orange cape which ties in the front in a yellow bow, short gloves, a thick belt with a circular buckle, capris, striped socks, and loafers. When his Devil Fruit is activated, his cloak was shown to darken in color. As a child, Oven wore a long sleeve shirt with ties in front. He wore orange and yellow pants.", "personality": "Oven has utmost loyalty to his mother and will follow her orders to the letter. This includes being complicit to exiling former husbands, as seen when he attacked Pound when he intruded on Cacao Island to see Chiffon. When ordering the people on Cacao Island to break all of their mirrors, he threatened to kill them and their families if they did not comply. Oven cares greatly for the safety of his siblings, as he became enraged upon seeing Pekoms holding his \"beloved\" little sister Brle at gunpoint, and due to his great respect for Katakuri, he attacked Luffy in a fit of rage after finding out he had beaten him. He also agreed not to intrude on Pudding's cake baking operation. However, he also takes betrayals extremely seriously, as he did not hesitate to attack Chiffon for being complicit in Bege's attempt to assassinate Big Mom, even though she was his sister and she assisted Pudding in making the substitute wedding cake, and Praline for siding with the Sun Pirates. When fighting his enemies, he sometimes is able to recognize the struggle they are going through and the ramifications of their fighting, but that does not make him merciful, as shown when he fought Pedro. He is also not above using underhanded tactics as he plotted to take Chiffon hostage to make Bege surrender. He is extremely prideful, as when the Nostra Castello was heading towards him, he refused to move out of its path, allowing Bege's ship to run him over. His pride extends to his crew's strength and reputation as an Emperor's pirate crew as he was shocked that Germa 66 was ambushing them at Cacao Island after Charlotte Nusstorte's army invaded their kingdom where he was certain they would be massacred and destroyed. He absolutely denied the possibility of Katakuri losing against Luffy, believing that the latter's chance of victory was zero and was completely shocked when he learned of Katakuri's defeat. Oven is also a hypocrite, as while he refuses to acknowledge Pound as his stepfather, he expressed rage at the latter for trying to attack him while referring himself as his stepson. His anger can also get the best of him. While attempting to sink the Nostra Castello, he risked ruining the substitute wedding cake needed to stop Big Mom's craving rampage. Oven can have quite a temper as he got extremely furious when Bege shot him in the face.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Minister of Browned Food, Oven has authority over Yakigashi Island in Totto Land. As an officer in the Big Mom Pirates, Oven holds a high position in the crew and has authority lower-ranking members. Vito noted Oven as one of the \"monsters\" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing him to his Sweet Commander siblings Katakuri and Smoothie. With a bounty of 300,000,000, the World Government considers him to be a threat. Oven is capable of conceiving practical and well-thought-out plans for dealing with enemies. He ordered all the mirrors on Cacao Island to be broken, with the exception of a large one in the town square to limit Luffy's possible escape routes from the Mirro-World. He is also capable of coordinating a large number of his siblings and soldiers in order to set up traps and defensive formations. He possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a blast of Haoshoku Haki from Big Mom and remain aware of her loud scream. Oven has enormous physical strength, as he could block a sword strike from Pedro, a powerful mink who is capable of cutting through metal armor and shields with great ease. Oven effortlessly overpowered Chopper in his Kung-Fu Point form, and though he was surprise-attacked by Vinsmoke Niji, a genetically enhanced superhuman who was empowered by his Raid Suit, he was shown to be unharmed by the kick. His punches are extremely powerful, as he is capable of dealing strong blows against large people like Chiffon and Pound. Oven also has tremendous durability, supposedly gifted with the sturdiest body among all the Charlotte sons. He took a kick to the shoulder from Sanji that knocked him into a building and swiftly recovered with only some minor bruises. He also suffered no injuries after being hit in the head with a giant club by his stepfather Pound with enough force to shatter the club, and although the force of the club was intended to knock him into the ocean while he was leaning over it, he did not move. He was even run over by Bege's massive ship, the Nostra Castello, and was not noticeably affected either. Oven also recovered from taking an explosive shot to the face from Bege's gun, again only gaining minor wounds. Even after receiving more severe wounds from being pierced by Vinsmoke Ichiji's \"Sparking Red\" ability, he quickly recovered and retained enough strength to continue fighting and give orders to his army. Oven is very fast, as he quickly moved to punch Pound after lying down in rubble several meters away. He was also able to quickly catch up to the seal-drawn carriage Pudding was driving. However, he was unable to notice Sanji's surprise kick on him. Oven ate the Netsu Netsu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to emit high heat from his body. He can augment his melee attacks by heating up his body, allowing him to burn whatever he hits. His high heat can also be used defensively, as it deters his enemies for getting too close. He can superheat anything he touches via heat's natural property of transference. This allows him to heat up his own weapons to make them stronger, heat up his opponent's weapons so that they are too hot to hold, and melt through anything that might be blocking his path. The transfer of heat can even happen without physical contact, as demonstrated when Oven seemingly projected his heat to Pekoms' gun to set it ablaze. He also demonstrated that he can set other objects and people ablaze at will by focusing his eyes on them, as seen when he set Wadatsumi and Aladine ablaze with a glare. He is even capable of superheating a large portion of the ocean, causing it to boil, simply by sticking his hands in the water. This causes the surrounding sea to become dangerously unsuitable for most ships and aquatic lifeforms to remain in, a highly effective tactic against fish-men. Additionally, he can control the flow of heat in the water, allowing him to launch torpedos of pure heat through the water. While attacking Pound, Oven wielded a large naginata with a handle that is longer than the blade. He can use his Devil Fruit powers to heat up his weapon, causing it to erupt in flames. Oven possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He also wears a dark-colored top hat with a light pink colored ribbon, as well as dark lipstick and eye makeup in the shape of a single line going down each eyelid.", "personality": "Mont-d'Or is very fearful of his mother, Charlotte Linlin, but is very loyal to her. He is fully committed in stopping any of his mother's enemies and is quick to take charge in tense situations. He seems to genuinely care for his family, as such when he showed great concern for Moscato before he was attacked by their mother, warning him not to show fear or he would lose his life. When he saw his brother Cracker's defeated body, Mont-d'Or flew into a rage and wished to inflict physical harm on the attacker. He also cursed Capone Bege for trying to assassinate his mother, immediately swearing retribution. Fittingly, he is quite brutal towards his enemies; when told his desire to slit the throats of the entire Straw Hat Crew and display their corpses in the press was too extreme, Mont-d'Or referred to it as \"[him] being nice\". Mont-d'Or is also somewhat rude and short-tempered, speaking to a child in a scathing manner when asked about Moscato's status and when one of his subordinates mentioned something obvious. He also expressed annoyance to Pekoms mourning Pedro's presumed death simply because the latter was an enemy as well as snapping at his subordinates when they informed him of bad news. He is very suspicious and even did not trust his older brother Opera. Like some of his siblings, he has a very arrogant view on his opponents. This was seen when he found it hard to believe that Monkey D. Luffy defeated Charlotte Cracker. He was also shown mocking Luffy for challenging Big Mom once more after he was imprisoned. However, he is willing to change this view after Tamago pointed out to him about all the unexpected incidents that occurred since the Straw Hats' invasion. After Stussy informed him that the explosion that toppled the Whole Cake Chateau came from the Tamatebako, the chest Big Mom received from the Straw Hats, Mont-d'Or began taking Luffy's crew more seriously to the point that he urged Oven not to take the crew lightly while telling him how necessary it was to set up a huge blockade to keep them from escaping. Mont-d'Or held utmost pride in his crew as he believed not even Gold Roger could escape from the blockade that comprised of the entire military force of the Big Mom Pirates. His pride in the Big Mom Pirates is so great that he will do anything to prevent his crew's reputation from being tarnished, as shown when he ordered Stussy and Morgans to be hunted down to prevent the news of their blemish from leaking to the outside world. Due to his pride, Mont-d'Or is extremely shocked when enemies defeated his Sweet Commander siblings such as Cracker and Katakuri.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Minister of Cheese, Mont-d'Or has authority over Cheese Island in Totto Land. He has a considerable reputation, as Germa Kingdom princes Vinsmoke Niji and Vinsmoke Yonji recognized him as a heavyweight within the Big Mom Pirates, which is notable given the vast size and strength of the crew. Mont-d'Or possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud screams. As an officer of the crew, he holds a high position in the crew, has authority over lower-ranking members, and also seems to have high authority as he held and led a meeting with his brothers and sisters, and some other Big Mom Pirates and also gave orders to his underlings, disregarding what Opera said. He also issued orders to several islands across Totto Land. In the anime, he has shown to have great intuition. He was able to deduce that Bobbin being sneak attacked was something related to the Straw Hat Pirates and that Sanji and Luffy were plotting something before the tea party. Mont-d'Or has great strategic skills, organizing his crew's forces and deploying them to hunt down their enemies, including the Straw Hat Pirates and the Fire Tank Pirates. Mont-d'Or ate the Buku Buku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to manipulate books. According to Jinbe's, Mont-d'Or's power is limited only by his imagination. He can telekinetically move books around and even use them as footholds. He can place people under the illusion that they are inside a book's setting by hovering an open book over them, which he calls the World of \"Books\" (\"\", \"Hon\" no Sekai?); such illusion will cease the instant the book is closed again. He is also able to physically trap people within the pages of a book by pinning them in with a nail. Once pinned inside a book, a victim will never age. However, trapped individuals can be freed by burning up the books, although they might catch fire too. While battling against Monkey D. Luffy on the outskirts of Sweet City, Mont-d'Or used a rifle. For use in assassinating the Vinsmoke Family, he and other members of the Big Mom Pirates were given Walkers."},

She has an enormous physique, standing at 880 centimeters or just shy of 29 feet tall, which is the largest known height for any human. She is taller than the extremely large Whitebeard and was able to hold the 277cm tall Brook in her hand.

She also sports a tattoo on her left shoulder and arm, consisting of a large, standard-shaped red heart framed by thin lines curled at their bottom ends, which all tops a far smaller heart. When she was five years old, Linlin towered over normal humans and was about the same size as a giant child. She had a much rounder face and had freckles on her cheeks, her hair was kept into two buns on both sides of her head. Her nose was more triangular compared to present-day where it now protrudes outward in a rounded, beak-like shape.

In Oda's depiction of her at this time, she wore a dark fedora with a polka dot pattern, a bandana, and a dark, polka dotted top with a captain's coat draped over her shoulders. She had a similar appearance (although shadowed) during her time in the Rocks Pirates. At 48 years old, her neck was considerably larger and more muscular than it was at 28 and she had a much larger, more pronounced jaw. By this time, she had already begun wearing Napoleon and her polka-dotted bandana. Five years ago, at age 63, her physique has become very much similar to currently at age 68, and she wore a purple and pink vertical stripped dress.

Big Mom wears a large pink bicorne hat bearing a Jolly Roger on the front. She has worn two versions: the first design consisted of a standard skull with crossbones behind it, as well as large flame-like patterns to the sides, whereas the current version, named Napoleon, has two crossed sabers instead of crossbones, possesses smaller lateral flame patterns, and is imbued with a fragment of her soul, causing its skull to change expressions and talk to Big Mom; on its top, the hat is edged with a thick yellow streak, it has a strip snap-fastened to it, and beneath it is a light, polka-dotted bandana fastened around Big Mom's head. Big Mom also dons a pink dress with red polka dots and white ruffles on its neckline and hemline, with a wide, rippling white cape attached to its back that falls to the ground. The outfit is completed with dark blue high heels, one turquoise pearl wristband on either wrist, and golden, jeweled rings on all her fingers. Hours after her craving fit for wedding cake started, Big Mom was noted to have gotten slimmer and slimmer up to the point where she has become emaciated. She went back to her usual appearance after eating Sanji's wedding cake. As O-Lin during the Wano Country Arc, she wears her hair in a shimada. During the Fire Festival, she changed into a black furisode kimono with a white minimalist floral pattern, over a light pink robe, tied with a yellow polka-dotted red sash tied in a bow.

{"name": "Charlotte Joconde", "episode": "Episode 894", "chapter": "Chapter 869", "year": 2018, "note": "", "appearance": "Joconde is a short woman with very long, bushy blonde hair. She wears a frilly strapped light greendress over a green shirt, as well as a knight's helmet with a long spike on top. She also wears gauntlets and armor on her legs too. She rides a helmeted horse as a mount.", "personality": "Joconde appears to take greatpride in her crew, as she was ashamed of the fact that so much of Big Mom's forces were gathered to defeat the 10-member Straw Hat team, calling it an embarrassment to Big Mom's name.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Joconde has authority over lower-ranking members of her crew.

{"name": "Charlotte Katakuri", "episode": "Episode 860", "chapter": "Chapter 825", "year": 2017, "note": "He was first mentioned by a Whole Cake Island resident in Chapter 843.", "appearance": "Katakuri is an extremely tall, large, and muscular man standing in at 509 cm. He stands at nearly three times Luffy's height and is slightly taller than his younger triplet brothers, Daifuku and Oven, who are incredibly tall themselves. He has short spiky crimson hair and two symmetric scars on both sides of his face. He has long legs, with his thighs being equally as long as his lower limbs. His mouth, which is usually covered up, contains sharp pelican eel-like teeth and is capable of expanding to an enormous size. Katakuri has sharp, intense, crimson eyes, highly arched eyebrows, and prominent lower eyelashes under each eye. He wears a massive light ragged scarf that covers his mouth and reaches his shoulders. He also wears a torn leather vest with \"CHARLOTTE\" on the back that exposes most of his torso, dark gloves and pants, a belt with a skull-shaped buckle, and spiked boots with spurs. His torso is very defined, having prominent abdominal muscles covered in pink tattoos, and he wears spiked bracelets on his arms as well as knee pads with a single spike on them. In the anime, Katakuri wore a dark cloak when arriving at the Whole Cake Chateau. As a child, Katakuri wore a dark torn jacket and dark pants without a scarf. It was only after Brle was attacked that he decided to cover his mouth.", "personality": "Katakuri is a calm, serious, and diligent man who devotes himself to protecting his family and crew and achieving their objectives. He frequently uses his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki to quickly address any problems or threats that he foresees, and whenever possible he will work to change the future, he foresees and stop the problem before it happens. Katakuri makes sure to waste no time in accomplishing his tasks; when his brother Perospero was gloating to the captured Vinsmoke Family, Katakuri told him to hurry and shoot them immediately. Katakuri is quite brutal when attacking opponents to ensure they are quickly neutralized and will use his weapons to inflict gruesome wounds with impunity. Katakuri's haste to resolve problems can sometimes work against him, though, as his attempts to change the future may not achieve his intended result. Katakuri is almost always calm even in the most perilous of situations, as it is necessary for his mind to be clear in order to utilize Kenbunshoku Haki. If he is taken by surprise or foresees something terrible in the future, he is shown to lose color on his face and he may sometimes shout, but he does not panic. When it comes to judging his opponent's power, Katakuri is neither boastful nor meek and so will bluntly point out when an opponent is clearly inferior to him (to the point of encouraging them to flee while they can) but will also notice if they pose a serious threat or are improving their abilities, and he will even commend enemies who demonstrate impressive strength or tactical maneuvers. He takes care to never underestimate his opponents' abilities, and rather than entertain the activation of a new ability he is quite pragmatic and will prevent his opponent from activating it. Even when his crewmates were confident that the Straw Hat Pirates would be killed by Big Mom before they could escape to their ship the Thousand Sunny, Katakuri took forces to lie in wait on the Sunny \"just in case.\" Katakuri also takes note of opponents' potential, and will specifically target enemies whom he feels could pose a more serious threat in the future. Katakuri takes his status as the strongest subordinate of Big Mom quite seriously and makes the effort to maintain the appearance of perfection that his siblings and crewmates consider him to have, particularly by never lying on his back in public. However, he has been shown to silence siblings who are heaping excessive amounts of praise onto him. Although he works to eliminate enemies efficiently, Katakuri is ultimately an honorable fighter who prefers to fight fairly and heavily respects opponents who can match him. Thus, he absolutely despises receiving assistance in a fight, and will even yell at a sibling if they interfere in his battles. If he finds that he inflicted a wound on someone due to outside assistance, he will give his own body the same wound to compensate for it and even the playing field. When he was bested in combat for the first time by Luffy, Katakuri retained his respect for the pirate and was enthused, rather than angry, when Luffy confirmed his intention of coming back and defeating Big Mom in the future. Later, he even smiled after learning that Luffy had escaped from Totto Land. To cope with the stresses of his position, Katakuri takes regular light meal breaks, known as merienda, where he feasts on his favorite food of doughnuts and drinks tea. Katakuri has loved doughnuts since he was a child, to the point of eating them so often that he caused his mouth to artificially expand. Eating doughnuts puts Katakuri in a state of bliss, and during his merienda he has been shown voicing his love for them out loud in very intimate language. Katakuri keeps his merienda extremely private as he lies on his back and relaxes during it, which is a stark contrast to his siblings' view of him as someone who never lies down. The merienda is a very important part of Katakuri's routine and so he will become quite annoyed if something keeps him from doing it at the allotted time. When his fight with Luffy made his merienda late, Katakuri became willing to forgo his usual diligence and attempted to quickly finish off his opponent by burying him in mochi, not taking the time to make sure Luffy had died. Another reason that Katakuri shrouds his merienda in utmost secrecy is that he is extremely sensitive about his pelican eel-like mouth, which he was bullied for as a child. Initially, he had no issue with just attacking his bullies in response, but after the bullies took revenge by attacking his younger sister Brle, Katakuri took to wearing a mouth covering at all times in public. When his cooks accidentally saw his mouth in the Mirro-World, Katakuri completely lost his mind and used brutal force against them with murderous intent; he was so angry that he even misheard one of their pleas as a comment about his mouth. However, Katakuri went on to take off his mouth covering during his fight with Luffy after acknowledging the latter as an equal, believing that Luffy was no more deserving of his sister Flampe's scorn than he was. Katakuri has a habit of telling people around him what he foresees them saying or doing next. This habit ended up backfiring on him during his fight with Luffy, as his vocal premonition of Luffy's Gear 4 deactivating gave Luffy the chance to fly away from him before it did.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders, Katakuri's authority in the Big Mom Pirates is second only to his mother's, and as Totto Land's Minister of Flour, he holds authority over Komugi Island. In battle, Katakuri is a very powerful combatant. His tremendous bounty of 1,057,000,000 shows how dangerous he is considered by the World Government, and Capone Bege of the infamous Worst Generation has likewise declared him a monstrous threat. According to his crewmates, Katakuri is the strongest of the Three Sweet Commanders, the strongest of Big Mom's children overall, and thus the most capable member of their crew aside from Big Mom herself; Daifuku even stated that, were Big Mom to die, Katakuri's skills would make him the worthiest of succeeding her as captain of the Big Mom Pirates. Katakuri has been called a \"monster\" for his strength ever since he was a child, and until his first loss against Luffy, he was said to have never lost a single battle throughout his lifehis long and perfect record of victory described by Oven as \"legendary\". Also, Katakuri is strong-willed, as he withstood a blast of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki long enough to continue on his feet to help his siblings. Noted to be the strongest of the Three Sweet Commanders, Katakuri possesses immense physical strength, being able to flick jellybeans with such extreme force and velocity that they act like bullets, mortally wounding his opponents with a single shot. Even from a great distance, Katakuri can kill a man with a flicked jellybean. He was also able to defeat Vinsmoke Ichiji, a genetically enhanced Germa 66 commander, who was wearing his Raid Suit, with minimal effort and without incurring any injuries himself. Katakuri is an extremely skilled and powerful hand-to-hand combatant. Supplemented with his Devil Fruit powers, he uses a fighting style similar to Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Mi techniques, and he can counter Luffy's Red Hawk without any effort. With his own version of Luffy's Elephant Gun, he overpowered and badly injured Luffy in a clash of strength. When he performed his Zan Giri Mochi attack, he was able to create a large crater in the ground when he sent Luffy crashing through the Mirro-World. Katakuri is extremely fast and possesses extraordinary reflexes. Due to his speed, an expert Kenbunshoku Haki user such as Luffy barely had time to react to his attacks. He effortlessly subdued the speedy mink Carrot, and kept up with the blinding speed of Luffy's Gear 2 attacks, catching the two of them off-guard with swift and powerful kicks. He was even able to keep up with Luffy's Gear 4 Snakeman form, and even outpace him at times. Katakuri possesses tremendous levels of durability and endurance, being able to withstand multiple immensely powerful attacks from Gear 4 Luffy and quickly recover to counterattack. He was able to impale himself with his own spear and showed only minor signs of discomfort. He also has vast reserves of stamina, being able to fight with Luffy non-stop for several hours in the Mirro-World without issue, succumbing to exhaustion only at the very end of the fight. Katakuri wields a trident named Mogura in battle. He was first seen wielding it during Sanji and Charlotte Pudding's wedding ceremony. When not in use, he keeps the trident inside his mochi body. Katakuri is extremely skilled in wielding his trident Mogura, which he uses in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers and physical prowess to perform devastating thrusts. When he was younger, he used a trident with a much simpler design. Katakuri's immense physical strength and accuracy allow him to act as a sniper and marksman. Katakuri is highly skilled in flicking jelly beans as improvised bullets with great accuracy. Even from a very far distance, he can kill Jigra, with a hit in the head from so far away that Bege did not even notice him, and later would have hit Sanji as well had the latter not dodged at the last moment. Katakuri ate the Mochi Mochi no Mi, a Special Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that lets him create, control, and transform his body into mochi at will. His mochi is extremely thick and adhesive, allowing him to trap even extremely strong enemies with it, although it loses its effectiveness when exposed to liquids. He frequently uses these abilities in hand-to-hand combat, sprouting several tendrils of mochi on his body to act as extra fists or legs; he can imbue these tendrils with Busoshoku Haki to deliver extremely hard punches and kicks. He is also able to enlarge his mochi limbs to gigantic size and stretch them to increase his attack range. By concentrating and compressing mochi into a single fist, Katakuri is capable of delivering punches of devastating power. Katakuri can transform his body like a Logia user to avoid attacks, as shown when he transformed himself into mochi when being struck by Capone Bege's bullets, and with the help of his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki, he is even capable of manipulating his body structure to dodge Haki-imbued attacks and remain unharmed. He is also very creative when using his fruit, as he created mochi earplugs to protect himself and his siblings from the sound of Big Mom's scream, and also used mochi to plug up and disable the cannons of Bege's Big Father fortress. Katakuri has also mastered his Devil Fruit powers to the point of awakening his Devil Fruit, enabling him to transform nearby inorganic material into mochi, greatly enhancing the range of his attacks and allowing him to manipulate the environment to his advantage. Katakuri is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. Katakuri is able to use Haoshoku Haki, as shown when he released a large burst along with Luffy's own Haoshoku Haki in order to knock out Charlotte Flampe and her subordinates as punishment for their interruption. Katakuri is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, as shown when he hardened his mochi leg in order to bludgeon and injure Luffy. His Haki enhanced strikes are powerful enough to counter and overpower Luffy's own Haki enhanced attacks, and he has boasted that his Busoshoku Haki is superior to Luffy's. When performing his Zan Giri Mochi attack, Katakuri's Haki becomes flame-shaped, like Big Mom's Haki and Luffy's Haki when he uses Gear 4, and the luster of it is blue. Katakuri has extraordinary mastery of Kenbunshoku Haki, able to use the advanced form of Kenbunshoku which allows him to see visions of a few seconds into the future. He was able to detect and instantly thwart an assassination attempt on Big Mom and her affiliates that would have been carried out moments later by a vengeful Tea Party invitee. His predictions were shown to be accurate when he justified his killing of the guest to Bege and knew word for word how the latter would respond to him. He would later repeat this capacity during his one-on-one battle against Luffy, accurately predicting the latter's intent to keep on fighting and eventually resorting to the use of Gear 4. He correctly foresaw Pudding breaking down and crying at the alter during the wedding ceremony and Luffy's intentions to break Carmel's portrait. Bege recognized him as the greatest obstacle to his own assassination plan. Katakuri can use his precognition to increase the accuracy of his attacks to such a degree that Luffy, who is a highly skilled Kenbunshoku Haki user himself, could barely dodge his assaults. The future events Katakuri sees can be changed, which he often attempts to do so himself, as shown when he prevented Jigra from carrying out the assassination plot he foresaw. However, changing the future may not solve anything, or may even make things worse, as shown when he tried to shoot Sanji. Other people are also capable of changing the foreseen future. Also, he is only able to perceive the future from his own senses, as he was confused as to why Pudding was crying at the altar because he was too far away to hear what was about to be said. Katakuri can use his Haki in conjunction with his Devil Fruit power to great effect. Since he can see slightly into the future, he can predict precisely where an attack will land, allowing him time to reshape his mochi body out of harm's way, making attacks simply pass through empty air. Since he is physically dodging the attack and preventing it from coming into contact with him in the first place, even attacks imbued with Busoshoku Haki will pass through him without harming him. With this ability, Katakuri is nearly untouchable, and he has stated that it had been years since someone laid a hand on him before Luffy managed to do so. Katakuri's Haki can only be nullified if he stops being calm and collected, or if he faces an opponent whose level of Kenbunshoku Haki rivals or surpasses his own."},

Over her clothes, she wears a polka-dotted outfit which balloons out like a jelly bean and allows her to float and bounce around.", "personality": "Flampe is an obsessive girl who looks up to her older brother Katakuri because of his apparent perfection, to the point that she would interrupt the battle between him and Luffy in order to preserve that status. She also loves him to the point that she would compete with her siblings to get her brothers favoritism. However, this obsession is entirely superficial, since Flampe displayed immense shock when Katakuri injured himself, and repeatedly mocked the appearance of her brother's hidden mouth. Flampe thus is very petty and immature, even threatening to gossip about Katakuri's display of weakness to everyone, all while disowning him as a relative of hers. Flampe is sadistic and tends to laugh at the misfortune of her enemies. This also includes her subordinates, as she will immediately demean and even attack them if they do something that fails to meet her standards. She also takes enjoyment in toying and torturing her opponents along with her subordinates. This extends to anyone she dislikes, as she attempted to torment Katakuri with the prospect of humiliating him about his mouth to the public. Flampe is shown to be rather vain, taking pleasure in her status as cutest sister (despite said status being mostly manufactured). However, she is loyal to her mother and her family as she accompanied Big Mom and her siblings to infiltrate Wano to retrieve Zeus and get her revenge on Luffy. She appears to be confident in her sharpshooting abilities and regards to being stealthy. Despite her sadism, Flampe is disgusted by blood, as she repeatedly derided Luffy for being bloodied during his fight with Katakuri, and likewise became extremely angry and disgusted with Katakuri himself when some of his blood splashed on her face.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the Minister of Honey, Flampe has authority over Rokumitsu Island, and as the Special Attack Unit Captain, Flampe has direct control over an entire squad that specializes in special attacks.

She does not possess a particularly strong will, as she was knocked out by Luffy and Katakuri's Haoshoku Haki. The Fluffy Balloon System (, Fuwafuwa Fsen Shisutemu?) is a device contained in Flampe's outfit, which allows her to float in the air like an actual balloon. The device was obtained when Big Mom was destroying other countries. Flampe's main weapon is a blowgun, which she uses to shoot \"Numbing Needles\" (, Shibire-bari?). Flampe is a skilled marksman, and her dress briefly deflates when she shoots, indicating that the air in it is used to shoot the blowgun and gives it great range. The needle shots are silent, allowing Flampe to take enemies by surprise, although they do not seem to be exceptionally powerful. The needles are so silent that neither Luffy nor Katakuritwo fighters with Kenbunshoku Hakinotice her interference. She used a fork to punish the sniper who failed to hit Luffy."},

{"name": "Charlotte Cracker", "episode": "Episode 835", "chapter": "Chapter 796", "year": 2016, "note": "Real appearance revealed in Chapter 838.", "appearance": "Cracker is a muscular man of notable height, at 307cm. He has mostly short, purple hair with a long, baguette-like bun tied at the back of his head and a pair of thin, pointed strands on either side that appear to spark like firecrackers. A very large scar covers his right eye and he has small wrinkles around both eyes. Cracker is shirtless and wears a kilt with decorative biscuits adorning it as well as shin length brown boots on his lower half. On his right shoulder, he wears a large brightly colored pauldron that has a pink polka dot cape attached to it. Cracker usually operates within a suit of biscuit armor, created by his Devil Fruit, and will only show himself if the armor is damaged or destroyed. This is to such an extent that his wanted poster mistakenly features the face of his armor, rather than his true appearance. This armor takes the form of a large, brutish-looking warrior (standing about four times bigger than Luffy) with a prominent nose, a large pointed beard, disproportionately thin limbs, and a prominent scar on the right side of its face (which it shares with the real Cracker). It is also fitted with a vest made of crackers, a Spartan-style warrior's helmet, and horns worn on the side of its head.", "personality": "Cracker is very loyal to his family and crew, demonstrated by his anger upon discovering that his former stepfather was revealing their secrets to Monkey D. Luffy and Nami. He firmly believes that one's heritage defines their character, incorrectly assuming that Sanji would happily consent to his arranged wedding out of loyalty to his family and that he would detest the Straw Hat Pirates for coming to Whole Cake Island to rescue him, oblivious to the fact that Sanji opposed the wedding and would never willingly speak ill of his friends. Like Big Mom and most of his siblings like his older brother Oven, he considers his own father and stepfathers to not be part of his family because they are not related by blood. Cracker is very confident in his power and prefers to deal with enemies alone, hating outside interference from his fellow crew members. He takes joy in using his Devil Fruit powers and overwhelming his enemies with their versatility; on the other hand, he hates it when people eat his biscuit creations as he does not like giving away biscuits for free. Cracker also absolutely despises feeling any amount of pain, even the prick of a needle, and prefers to fight others with his biscuit creations. He is also very proud of his anonymity, referring to the World Government's incorrect photo of him in his wanted poster. Like the rest of his family, Cracker is very arrogant and views himself superior to his opponents, mocking Luffy throughout most of the fight. He also tends to brag during his fights due to how powerful his Biscuit Soldiers can be. He decided to tell Luffy how his powers worked after the latter was able to discover his true appearance as a mocking gesture. This later proved to be a costly mistake on his part, as Luffy and Nami were able to take advantage of the knowledge Cracker gave them in order to defeat him.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates, Cracker's authority in the crew is second only to his mother's. As the Minister of Biscuit, Cracker rules over Biscuits Island and is responsible for procuring and distributing biscuits to whoever needs them. He is also capable of commanding large fleets into battle. Cracker's voice and presence alone are enough to cause nearby homies to shrink away and wither in fear, indicating that his power commands tremendous fear and respect among his fellow crewmates. His bounty of 860,000,000 indicates that the World Government considers him highly dangerous and threatening to their operations. His power and influence is so great that when he was defeated, Sweet City was put into a state of lockdown. Big Mom was also confident that Cracker could defeat Monkey D. Luffy, who managed to bring down Donquixote Doflamingo, further testifying to his combat strength. Though Urouge of the Worst Generation managed to defeat one of his fellow Sweet Commanders, Cracker defeated him afterward, though he did not manage to kill the Supernova. In battle, Cracker has displayed exceptional skill in deception and trickery; when fighting Luffy, he made it appear as though he had Devil Fruit powers related to multiplying limbs and weapons and when Luffy landed a powerful Gomu Gomu no Kong Gun on his armor, Cracker had it cough up blood-like jam in order to appear badly wounded by the blow. He was able to effectively deceive the entire World Government and the Marines despite being an infamously powerful pirate, being able to conceal his true identity and make his Biscuit Soldier pose as himself to the point his bounty poster depicts the Soldier and not him. Cracker has some degree of culinary skill, as he has created a jam concoction that resembles blood. Cracker has also shown immense amounts of stamina, being able to fight and chase after Luffy for eleven hours. He has extraordinary strength, able to wield Pretzel, a very large sword, while maintaining sufficient speed to keep up with Luffy. In the anime, he is shown being able to clash evenly with Luffy, who was in Gear 4, and pushing him back with Pretzel. Cracker wields a huge double-edged sword named Pretzel, which is one of the Meito and a blade larger than himself with a crossguard shaped like a biscuit. He claims that it is a unique sword which has no peers. Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers each wield one or more much larger replicas of Pretzel made out of biscuit. He can also create biscuit shields with his Devil Fruit. Cracker is extremely skilled in wielding Pretzel, as he can attack very quickly despite the sword's size. Combined with Busoshoku Haki, he was able to cut through Luffys Gear 4-enhanced Haki defenses with his sword. Cracker ate the Bisu Bisu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and manipulate biscuits at will. He creates the biscuits by clapping, and in addition to creating whole biscuits, he can crumble the biscuits into super-fine crumbs. The biscuits he creates are also super-durable, though they can be softened by water. He primarily uses this power to create large puppet soldiers. He uses whole biscuits to shape the torso, and uses biscuit crumbs to create arms, legs, and the face of a tough guy. He can even use his biscuits to create weapons for his puppets. Cracker can manipulate his puppets' bodies at will, including granting them extra limbs and additional weapons. The puppets are hollow, so while Cracker can control them from afar, he can also hide inside them, using one as a suit of armor. He can even imbue the puppet he inhabits with Busoshoku Haki, further increasing its defensive capabilities. Cracker has extraordinarily powerful Busoshoku Haki, which he uses to harden his sword(s) and biscuit armor. Defensively, it allowed him to easily repel Luffy's own Haki-imbued Gear 2 and Third attacks, causing the latter to remark on its incredible toughness. Offensively, it strengthened his sword enough to let him cut near-halfway through Luffy's Haki-imbued arm in Gear 4 (a notable feat, as even Doflamingo had previously shown inability to harm Luffy's Gear 4 form). Cracker possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},

{"name": "Charlotte Brûlée", "episode": "Episode 831", "chapter": "Chapter 791", "year": 2016, "note": "Real appearance was revealed in Chapter 832.", "appearance": "Brle looks in many respects like the stereotypical witch. She is an extremely tall, slightly hunched, and gray-skinned woman with a well-endowed yet thin figure, which makes her limbs appear to be exceptionally long. She stands at roughly twice Nami's height (170cm), with her legs alone being noticeably longer than said woman is overall. She also has very long, gnarled fingers with overlong, sharp nails painted blue. The woman's face has very striking, hag-like features. Her droopy eyes have yellow irises and long lashes, and are topped by viridian eye shadow and black, high-arched eyebrows, which she keeps perpetually furrowed. She has a huge and over-projected, reddish hook nose (similar to her mother's), a large mouth with purple lipstick that is usually seen devilishly smiling, a square jaw, and a brown, sharp-cornered scar stretching diagonally down her face from right to left. Brle's hair is lavender and divided into two side locks that cascade over her breasts, as well as four other, similarly long, and sharp, lock-like segments that stick to the sides, slightly curved upward. She takes to wearing a whitish, creased gown. Its main upper section has a frilly scoop neckline, loose, flaring sleeves that are tattered at the edges, and stops quite below the waist in a frilled hemline, adorned by a horizontal row of red roses above. The lower, seemingly separate part of the dress, which begins under the upper one, falls to the ground and, too, has roses stitched onto itself in the aforementioned manner. Brle's clothing is completed by a feathered, sleeveless overcoat in moss green color (the latter, in addition to her grayish skin, earning her comparison to a tree by Carrot and to a branch by Monkey D. Luffy). When she was taken to Capone Bege's hideout, her attire is forcefully changed into a more clean and elegant dress by the Fire Tank Pirates, which is also light in color, with two frilled hemlines and closer-fitting sleeves, as well as a light-colored coat above with actual sleeves and a light fur trim. Her hair was brushed into two sideward wicks. But after being saved by Katakuri, she changed her hair back to having four locks. As a young child, Brle's hair was shorter and partitioned into eight locks, and her nose was small, cone-shaped, and a paler shade of red. Her skin was also a pale beige-gray color. She wore a white short sleeve dress with flowers around the neckline.", "personality": "Brle is prideful, as she was rather offended when Carrot referred to her as a talking tree and Luffy called her a branch, as well as when her mother sent Charlotte Cracker to fight the Straw Hats in her stead due to not considering her powerful enough. Brle is confident in her powers and claims that she could kill the Straw Hats in an instant, not liking to be underestimated. Due to the terrible scar on her face, she is envious of those with alluring faces to the point that she wants to slice them up. Her jealousy is also tempered with a very sadistic nature as shown when she intended to boil Carrot alive, Brle was excited in disfiguring Carrot's face with horrible burns. She scoffs at the notion of anyone succeeding against an Emperor like Big Mom, believing it to be ridiculous and impossible. She also thinks very little of the Worst Generation, believing their actions in the first half of the Grand Line were not that big of an achievement. Like most of her siblings, Brle is arrogant and has the upmost pride in her crew and family. This is shown when she boasted to Luffy about Katakuri's strength and how he had never lost before. This leads her to underestimate her opponents, as she was shocked to learn that Brook managed to get copies of the Poneglyphs and hid them from Big Mom, and became devastated when Katakuri was defeated by Luffy. Brle seems to share her mother's dream of creating a paradise with every race united, and finds great joy in discovering new kinds of creatures, especially animals. However, she seems to be extremely close-minded about non-humans, as she considers minks to be mere animals and has no qualms about threatening to consume them, even disregarding their begging for mercy. She also thinks very little of her mother's husbands, as she jeeringly declared her ex-stepfather, Pound, an enemy with no chance of returning from his actions. She also cackled with glee when revealing that none of Big Mom's affiliates could leave her alive. Brle is very loyal to her mother, as she followed her orders to keep Luffy and his group away from Sanji. She is also loyal to her family, as she went with Katakuri's plans to ambush the Straw Hats on their ship. She detests traitors, yelling angrily at Jinbe when she discovered him with the Sanji Retrieval Team, as well as questioning Chiffon in her participation in her husband's plot to assassinate their mother. She also became enraged at Pekoms for using her to assist Luffy in escaping. Brle is noted by her own family to be very careless and clumsy as proven when she easily ended up getting herself captured by her enemies for them to exploit her Devil Fruit powers as shown with Chopper and Luffy. Due to her arrogance and carelessness, Brle is very cowardly if she is caught in a helpless situation that would endanger her life. When Brle was being used by the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates, she became terrified if her mother considered her a traitor and that she would be killed. When Luffy found her while he was retreating from Katakuri, Brle became terrified as she was taken hostage to escape the Mirro-World while pleading to Katakuri to save her. On Nuts Island, after being spotted, Brle pleaded for Perospero and Amande, and a deranged Big Mom to save her. Brle is tricky and deceptive, using her Devil Fruit to separate Luffy from his group by disguising as him and deceiving the retrieval team, and managed to capture Carrot in the Mirro-World. Though she is not always perceptive, as she failed to notice the frog transformed into Carrot was not actually speaking and also did not piece together that the duplicate mink came from her own Devil Fruit ability. Brle also seems very susceptible to tickle torture, as she easily gave Chopper and Carrot all the answers they needed when they tickled her. Despite being usually cruel to enemies, Brle has a kind and caring side as she genuinely loved her family, as she was crying when the Whole Cake Chateau was falling over with her family on it. Even as a child, she tried to comfort Katakuri, telling him not to blame himself for her brutal disfigurement by his bullies. She also tearfully reported Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands to her family and crew in order to ensure that neither he nor Sanji manage to escape. However, she was more concerned about Katakuri being hurt by Luffy rather than his loss against the latter. Brle cares for her brother in high regards, that she knew that Katakuri lays on his back and kept quiet about it out of respect towards him. Like other people, Brle has a unique laughing style: \"Wiwwiwwiwwi\" (?).", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Big Mom Pirates, Brle holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members. Brle is a fairly powerful fighter, as Big Mom had enough confidence in her to prevent the Sanji Retrieval Team from escaping the Seducing Woods. She is also capable of coordinating with several homies in the forest to fight against them. However, her family notes that Brle is actually very clumsy and not as strong as she perceives herself. True enough, Chopper and Carrot were able to defeat her by using her powers against her and was even captured by an exhausted Luffy when he needed to escape from his fight with Katakuri. She was also easily captured by Pekoms and held hostage. Brle possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream. Brle is rather strong, as she was easily able to lift and holdNami by the neck with one hand. She also uses her long and sharp fingernails to slice people.Brle also has fast reflexes. She was able to dodge Pound's punch easily and defend against Carrot, an extremely fast mink in her own right.She has considerable endurance, as she was able to withstand being scalded by a giant pot of soup as well as being electrocuted by Carrot's Electro and Nami's Thundercloud Rod, thenregain consciousness shortly afterwards. She is skilled in tactics such as ambush, traps, and trickery as seen when she easily separated Luffy from the Sanji Retrieval Team, sneaked up on Nami by disguising herself as Luffy, and easily trapped Carrot, a capable mink fighter, with only minimal effort. Brle ate the Mira Mira no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to create and manipulate mirrors. She can use her mirrors to reflect attacks back at her opponents, turn any mirror into a portal to the \"Mirro-World\", and transform herself and other living things into mirror images of different people. By creating a mirror shield, she can provide herself with an absolute defense that not only shields her, but also reflects an opponent's attacks back at them, turning their own strength against them. She can transform herself into a mirror image of a chosen target; while transformed into someone's reflection, she will do and say exactly whatever her target does and says, like a perfect reflection. The reverse is also true, allowing her to force the target to reflect her own words and actions. She can even reflect other people's Devil Fruit powers. She can also transform herself into a partial reflection, such as reflecting a person's body, but with her own face. This gives her access to that person's abilities and powers, but does not link the two to mimic each other's actions. She has the ability to transform other living things, such as animals, into reflections as well, though these reflections are not linked to mimic the original or vice versa. This allows her to create chaos and confusion among her enemies. She can turn any mirror she touches into a doorway that connects the real world and her personal pocket dimension, the Mirro-World, a long tunnel filled with countless mirrors, each one connected to a counterpart mirror in the real world. Brle is referred to as \"The Only Key to the Mirro-World\" (, Miro Wrudo no Yuiitsu no Kagi?); without her, the mirrors in the Mirro-World are just mirrors, though they can be used as windows to view what is on the other side of their respective real world counterparts. She can use the Mirro-World to support her allies by allowing them to travel through the Mirro-World so that they can emerge from a mirror at an advantageous location. She can also use the Mirro-World to trap her enemies, as no one can enter or leave the Mirro-World without her. When she chased Chopper and Carrot inside the Mirro-World, Brle wielded a scythe. Brle seems to have some medical knowledge as she tended to Katakuri's wounds after his defeat at the hands of Luffy."},

{"name": "Chadros Higelyges", "episode": "Episode 581", "chapter": "Chapter 490", "year": 2010, "note": "His real name was revealed in Vivre Card.", "appearance": "Brownbeard is a very large, overweight man who appears to be roughly three times the height and four times the width of a normal human. He possesses a long brown beard, with three distinctly kept braids, as well as a mustache. He wears a large coat, over an open shirt, that seems to only reach to his shoulders. He leaves his chest bare, with something that appears to be a large wrestling belt with his jolly roger on it. His hair appears to come out of the top of his tricorne and is braided back. After his encounter with Hawkins just before the timeskip, he lost the use of his legs. He is now an alligator centaur, thanks to the efforts of Caesar Clown and Trafalgar Law. His lower body consists of four alligator legs and a tail. He also added a maroon colored jacket with fur-rimmed gloves, fitting for the cold nature of Punk Hazard.", "personality": "Upon his introduction, Brownbeard was rather arrogant, as he claimed an island as under his protection, and addressed himself as \"Brownbeard-sama\", \"sama\" being an honorific of something like \"lord\" or \"master\"; this led him to proudly show off his bounty in an attempt to intimidate his opponents, despite it being lower than the New World average of 100,000,000, as well as being worth less than one-third of said opponent's bounty. He was angry when the Straw Hat Pirates claimed that they had never heard of him before he bragged about his own name, and coupled with how Basil Hawkins claimed his name was a joke, seemed to make him start to doubt his level of recognition, to the point he was joyfully surprised when the G-5 Marines recognized him. He seems to be an opportunist, as he attacked an island that was once under Whitebeard's protection right after the great pirate's demise. Although he thinks himself as powerful, he is shown to know when his opponent out-classes him; he became terrified when he realized that he was fighting someone, who had a bounty of 400,000,000 at the time. After two years, it would seem that his defeat at the hands of Basil Hawkins has humbled Brownbeard. Contrary to how he acted before the timeskip, he now truly values camaraderie and friendship. He deeply cares about his crew as well as the other former prisoners whom he had befriended, aiding the Straw Hats when he realized that Caesar was merely using him and the other prisoners as guinea pigs, and grew angry at Caesar once he discovered that; this anger grew stronger when Caesar revealed that he was the one who caused the poison gas explosion four years ago, not Vegapunk. His perception of the Straw Hat Pirates also changed once he realized Caesar's true nature. Like many other characters, Brownbeard has his own unique laugh, which is \"Uohhohho\".", "abilities_and_powers": "Since Brownbeard is a former New World pirate captain, it can be assumed that he has a decent amount of strength, though he was no match for a member of the Worst Generation. As the boss of the Centaur Patrol Squad, he held some authority on Punk Hazard prior to Caesar dismissing him. He seems to possess endurance that can easily be seen as superhuman, since he survived getting shot point-blank multiple times by Scotch's massive gun, and even being blown away by Caesar's attack afterwards, an attack that was powerful enough to eradicate the remains of the laboratory ruins they were all in. He was even able to move after all those ordeals, without showing any signs of strain, although he was obviously wounded. Even after Caesar injecting him with a muscle relaxant, Brownbeard was still able to force himself to stand and retaliate with his sword. He was also able to endure being openly fired upon by Caesar's subordinates and not pass out. Having his original legs crippled by Basil Hawkins, he was transformed into an alligator centaur; his new legs enable him to carry a group of people with ease so the Straw Hats use him as a means of transportation. He can also run very fast. Brownbeard had some tactical intelligence. After observing Luffy deflecting his troop's cannon shots, he deduced that Luffy is a Devil Fruit user and that his men could kill him by aiming at the water near Luffy's boat to capsize it. When first revealed to be the leader of the centaurs patrolling Punk Hazard, he was seen with a large sword fitting one of his size but was not seen using it. Later, during his short fight with Caesar and afterwards, he used a metal pipe. However, it was useless against Caesar's Logia ability. After that, he returned to using his sword against Caesar during their second confrontation, but it was once again ineffective."},
{"name": "Charlos", "episode": "Episode 499", "chapter": "Chapter 393", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Charlos has the same hairstyle as his father and sister. He has a wide, obese face and what appears to be stubble around his thick-lipped mouth. He always has snot hanging from one of his nostrils, which he regularly picks at. As a Celestial Dragon, he wears the typical full-body, thick white suit of obese frame that resembles a spacesuit with medals or buttons on it, with a green collar, and a resin bubble that grants him a supply of oxygen separate from the ones commoners breathe.", "personality": "Charlos is more of a spoiled brat in comparison to his sister and lacks a sense of responsibility. His personality can be compared to Helmeppo's when Luffy first met him, although seemingly worse. While he shares the same disregard for commoners as his rest of World Nobles, he is more prone to acting immature or violent than they are. While his family shows commoners where their place is whenever they pass by, Charlos purposely goes out of his way to make it clear. He made his slave suffer like his sister did, but his sister simply shot her slave whereas he pushed his slave to the limits until he collapsed, and then sold him off to ensure the man's continued suffering. He also seems to have a very strong need for confirmation from his father, as he constantly wants him to see and acknowledge his actions. Due to his completelyspoiled nature and arrogance as a World Noble, Charlos is extremely selfish and unreasonable.Considering himself a god, he believeshe has the right to cruelly enslaveanyone including royalty and willruthlessly murderanyone who refusesto comply with his demandsas is shown when he ordered Rob Lucci to kill Neptune when he attemptedto savehis own daughter from him. Like any World Noble, Charlos demands absolute respect and obedience from commoners and will not tolerate anyone who dares to defy him. This was shown when he was aghast when he saw that Zoro wasn't bowing to him like the others and immediately shot at him when Zoro spoke to him. He also shot at Luffy when he walked right up to him in order to punch him. He won't even accept defiance from a fellow Celestial Dragon, like when he swore revenge on Saint Mjosgard for hitting him with a club to prevent him from taking Shirahoshi. He also wastes money, as seen by his committing to spend an absurd amount of money on Camie while just intending to put her in a tank full of piranhas and watch her swim for her life. He generally does not bother much with details and leaves his escorts to handle the issues of things like paperwork. He also has a habit of picking his nose all the time. Charlos is an incredibly foolish and ignorant man, showing no form of maturity or common sense no matter how many beatings he receives. Even after being attacked by Mjosgard for his actions in trying to enslave Shirahoshi, he learned nothing from the ordeal and still tried to enslave her again later by using Kuma as a weapon. Again, for his actions gets him brutally beaten up by Sai and Leo as they flatten his head while Mjosgard takes responsibility for attacking him. Charlos is obsessed with mermaids, having spent a massive amount of money just to buy Camie. After taking an interest in Shirahoshi, Charlos went as far as to openly attempt to enslave her during the Levely. There seems to be a running gag for this, as every time he tries to enslave a princess mermaid for his own entertainment and selfishness, he gets a consequently beating from others learning nothing from his actions, being brutally beaten up by Luffy, Mjosgard, Sai and Leo. His actions can be considered even more abusive and extreme than the rest of the ordinary World Nobles.", "abilities_and_powers": "As a World Noble, Charlos has immense political power to do as he pleases and can summon an admiral if he is harmed in any way. His authority allows him to enslave anyone, even royalty, and he can order CP0 to assassinate people or protect him. Physically, Charlos is very weak despite his large body, as he would rather be carried around by a slave than walk, and was easily knocked out with one punch by Luffy and when struck by Mjosgard with a mace. He seems to have good eyesight as he could see Zoro moving at a fast speed, though he is not very bright as he believed that Zoro was killed by the bullet that he dodged, when Bonney actually acted by pushing Zoro down and covering him in tomato sauce. Charlos wields a golden pistol, but it is unclear how skilled he is at using it, since Luffy and Zoro were able to dodge his shots with ease. He basically uses it to shoot anyone who displeases him at point blank range. He did manage to shoot Hatchan, something that made him overly excited and proud."},

{"name": "Cerberus", "episode": "Episode 444", "chapter": "Chapter 339", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Cerberus was a zombie with three heads, two of them were dog heads and the other was a fox. The dog parts had blue fur while the fox's side had yellow fur. It also had three yellow tails, and the dog parts had yellow hair on the top of their heads and backs and one of the tails had white fur on the tip. Like all other zombies, its body was covered in sutures and scars. Its zombie number, 82, was written on its right side. Cerberus wore a red collar with spikes and had bandage covering its neck, along with the left eye of the fox's head, three of the legs, and the upper and lower torso.", "personality": "Cerberus was a very aggressive, as seen when it attacked Nami, Usopp, and Chopper and, later, Luffy and the crew. However, when Luffy threatened to eat it, Cerberus became scared. Cerberus was then tamed by the pirate captain, making it more subservient and docile. Cerberus' fox head seemed to have a complex about not being a dog, as it acted with other heads when it first appeared, but, after Chopper pointed out the difference, the fox head realized the difference itself and became very angry.", "abilities_and_powers": "Cerberus had fangs and claws that it could use to attack its prey. It was also very fast. Although Cerberus frightened Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, Luffy easily defeated it."},
{"name": "Cavendish", "episode": "Episode 704", "chapter": "Chapter 632", "year": 2013, "note": "", "appearance": "Cavendish is considered very attractive by both women and men, who often faint upon seeing him. His bright sky blue eyes are drawn in a style Oda usually uses for women. He is a lean yet muscular man with long, flowing blond hair that reaches just past his shoulders. He is fairly tall, standing at a height of 208 cm. He wears a black cowboy hat with a large aqua blue colored plume. He sports a ruffled white v-neck shirt under a coat draped over his shoulders. His trousers are dark purple in the anime, but are dark purple and have a thin white stripe on the sides and end in a ruffle just below a pale yellow and aqua blue star on each knee in the anime. In the manga the stripes are orange. Each of his brown high-heeled boots have bronze buckles attached by dark purple straps just above each ankle. He carries his sword Durandal on his left side, as he is right-handed. When possessed by his alter ego, Hakuba, his face slightly changes and gets a demonic appearance. His face becomes shadowed, his eyes become completely white, and his mouth is opened in a permanent sneer with no teeth showing whilst smiling. All-in-all, his face resembles the grinning mask from the two masks which symbolize drama, though it resembles the gloomy mask when frowning. His hair also comes loose from its ringlets, becoming a bit unkempt, and in the anime it becomes slightly dull. His voice also changes from mild-mannered and cultured to gruff and murderous. When both personalities are fighting for control of the same body, his face twists into what Bartolomeo considers \"half-and-half\", its features mixed between the two personalities split right down the middle. In the anime, the eye on Cavendish's dominant side also turns yellow-orange (it is unknown if this is Hakuba's actual eye color when his expression is not in its default manic state or an artistic choice to better differentiate between the two personalities, as Hakuba is always seen with featureless blank white eyes when in full control of Cavendish's body) while Hakuba's dominant side retains Cavendish's natural blue eye. When transformed into a toy, he has a round-shaped head with a cone hat and he wears a polka dotted shirt.", "personality": "Because of his good looks, Cavendish is extremely haughty, prideful, arrogant, boastful and vain, and loves attracting attention. Because of this, he harbors a deep-seated resentment towards the Worst Generation for stealing the spotlight from him two years ago. He even stabs their wanted posters to vent his anger. He is also shown to get deeply annoyed when the person he is talking to ignores him. Due to his petty jealousy, he is even willing to kill those he is jealous of with his own hands and will not let anyone get in his way as shown when he tried to fend off Chinjao, a former pirate who also wanted to kill his intended target at the time. Cavendish is also prepared to kill anyone who plans to take his prey away from him such as Bartolomeo. Despite his extreme narcissism and pettiness, he has an animal-loving nature, in particular towards to his horse and steed, Farul. He became enraged when his animal companion and dearest friend was badly wounded, and he immediately sought revenge on the Donquixote Pirates, showing that he has a deep emotional attachment to his animal friend and companion. Due to his royal heritage as a prince, Cavendish is highly sophisticated with a great penchant for fanciness as his make-shift meal after the B block was a posh-looking dinner on a tablecloth, with wine and a fancy main course, all of which was served by a waiter. He seems to be quite sociable as he tried to have a conversation with \"Lucy\" (unaware at first that he was actually Monkey D. Luffy, one of the Supernovas Cavendish hates), despite him being a total stranger. He can be very polite and civil even to people with bad reputations, as he congratulated Bartolomeo for his win despite his bad image. He has once been seen eating a rose he was carrying around, due to roses being his favorite food. He loathes others who have gained popularity, specifically those who take attention away from him, but will become immensely happy when he manages to recapture the spotlight, as shown during his speech to the spectators at the Coliseum defending Rebecca. However he seems unable to turn down a request from a \"fan\". This is shown when he accepts Luffy's request to get the others off of the King's Plateau, after mistakenly believing that the Straw Hat is his fan. While he deeply loathes those who gained immense popularity, he shows sympathy for those who are extremely unpopular as shown when he stood up for Rebecca when the audience booed and jeered at her. He is somewhat honorable as he stated to the audience that a warrior's life is not something one should put up for show and that those who are not willing to risk their own lives have no right to scorn. After seeing Usopp confronting Sugar and Trebol, Cavendish begged him to succeed while promising he won't go after Luffy anymore. After being freed from Sugar's curse, Cavendish kept his word as he ceased his grudge against Luffy. This also extends to Zoro and Law. Later on, his love for honor returned when he refused to leave Law alone after he was defeated by Doflamingo, stating that if Law is determined to die if Luffy is defeated, it would only be after Cavendish dies protecting him. During Doflamingo's \"Birdcage\", Cavendish displays being level-headed and is quite perceptive. He knew that Doflamingo was never planning on sparing Dressrosa after his exposure even if the people complied with the tyrant's demands. When he was in the underground trade port, Cavendish deduced that if Doflamingo is defeated, Luffy and Law would be at the center of the wrath of the people Doflamingo made deals with. True to his words, when he and his allies were fleeing Dressrosa, an army of ships came to the island to exact their revenge on the two. Cavendish possesses a split personality known as Hakuba, which appears only when Cavendish falls asleep. Hakuba is both cruel and merciless, and attacks the people around him with incredible speed while wearing a demonic grin on his face, disappearing only once everyone has been defeated. Cavendish is aware of Hakuba's existence and, by sheer willpower, is able to suppress him to a certain degree when he does not wish him to be present. However, the two tend to argue over the control of their body, where in one case was when Cavendish was upset with how Hakuba chose to attack Robin. Despite his faults, Cavendish is shown to be very righteous and upright, as he defended Rebecca from the audience's vicious insults despite being completely strangers, leading Luffy to be impressed by him despite their initial enmity. He later showed disdain on how Sugar turns her own soldiers into toys. He also strongly criticized his alter ego Hakuba's murderous and blood thirsty nature, and is willingly to physically hurt himself to restrain his alter ego. He can be generous as he also gave his coat to Robin after she was injured by Diamante's spiked iron balls to stop the bleeding. When as Cavendish, he refers to himself with \"boku\" (?), a young boyish way of saying \"I\", but as Hakuba, he uses \"ore\" (?), a more masculine version of \"I\".", "abilities_and_powers": "The fact that he has a 330,000,000 bounty indicates that he is quite powerful despite not having eaten a Devil Fruit. Three years ago, he was an infamous and feared pirate known to the world before being upstaged by all the Supernovas from the Worst Generation. With his \"beautiful\" appearance, he is able to make women faint from looking at him. Cavendish owns a white stallion called Farul and possesses excellent horsemanship skills, being able to skillfully ride Farul up the highly complex terrain of the New King plateau while carrying Law, Luffy and Kyros. He is also a very charismatic person who is able to sway the crowd in his favor. Physically, he possesses a fair amount of superhuman power, as he was seen able to hold Chinjao's massive build in the air, after Chinjao stopped his \"Biken: Blue Bird\" with his headbutt. The fact that he was not shaken by the force of the headbutt and did this with only one arm demonstrates the incredibly high degree of his physical strength. The force he applies in his swordsmanship is powerful enough to create a compressed air slash that can slash through large amounts of stone as shown he cut through part of New King Plateau to create a path. He also has some skills in acrobatics, being able to dodge a double-punch attack directed at him from Chinjao while he was in the air, as well as a barrage of headbutts aimed at him and Luffy, showing considerable speed and reflexes. Cavendish has an extremely high level of skill in swordsmanship, acknowledged by Vice Admiral Bastille as the prodigious \"Genius of the Sword.\" In the anime, Cavendish defeated multiple powerful gladiators, including Gardoa, with great ease. Specializing in Strong Blade swordsmanship, Cavendish can create extremely powerful compressed air slashes that can cleanly slice large amount of stone and also swiftly decapitate a giant metal doll. Cavendish could use his sword to deflect several String Bullets from Doflamingo aimed at Robin and an injured Trafalgar Law. When taken over by his alter ego, Cavendish's prowess as a swordsman significantly increased, switching to Gentle Blade swordsmanship that makes full use of Hakuba's tremendous speed, able to strike down the remaining twenty fighters of D Block instantly. He also cut down Dellinger, who is noted by the dwarves to be one of the best fighters of the Corrida Colosseum, in a single slash. Cavendish has an unusual condition, a combination of narcolepsy, sleepwalking, and dissociative identity disorder. His inner personality, Hakuba, awakens when Cavendish falls asleep and grants him tremendous speed, to the point that he moves too fast for the eyes to track; even with Haki he can barely be seen. Due to this, back in the Rommel Kingdom, everyone believed it was the wind that was slashing people. As such, the phenomenon became known as the \"Kamaitachi of Rommel\" (, Ronmeru no Kamaitachi?, literally meaning \"Sickle Weasel of Rommel\"). An even greater example of Hakuba's speed is that he instantly defeated Dellinger, an executive of the Donquixote Pirates, without even being seen, who himself is renowned for defeating opponents with his speed. As a fighting style it is not ideal for match-style fights like the competition in Corrida Colosseum. Though he defeated the twenty strongest fighters in D Block instantly, in the end it led to Rebecca's victory (as she was the only one who managed to see and barely evade his attack) as he promptly fell asleep afterwards. It is also not ideal for fighting alongside comrades as Hakuba will attack both enemies and allies alike. Cavendish has been shown to be able to suppress Hakuba to a degree where he can access his extremely incredible speed without losing control, but only for a very short duration, and he will still fall asleep afterwards. He is usually seen carrying one of the Meito named Durandal and is proficient in using it. Cavendish possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

He also wears a larger chef's hat. He wears the same chef's uniform, and has knives on his right side. He also has a striped ascot, instead of a solid colored one, along with a new apron.", "personality": "He appears to be Patty's closest friend and coworker aboard the Baratie, with much of the same \"fighting cook\" disposition. However, he is noticeably more levelheaded and cautious, often rebuffing Patty's more egotistical or quick-tempered displays; he also appears to be better-informed about local history, including Don Krieg's origins and modus operandi. Like Patty, he is completely deferential toward Zeff, and views Sanji with a mixture of hostility and begrudging respect.", "abilities_and_powers": "Carne is one of the Baratie's best chefs, specializing in charcuterieandall manner of meat-based cuisine.He is capable enough to be entrusted by Zeff to run the Nasugasira teppanyaki ship.

{"name": "Catarina Devon", "episode": "Episode 575", "chapter": "Chapter 484", "year": 2010, "note": "She was first mentioned by Emporio Ivankov in Chapter 538.", "appearance": "Devon is an extremely tall, pale-skinned, and well-endowed woman (shown to stand a similar height to her captain, who is 344cm) with her hair in a set of girlish pigtails. Her face has wrinkles, a sloping forehead, a long witch-like nose, a devilish grin, and a square jaw. Before the timeskip, she wore a striped Impel Down uniform with a V-neckline. She also wore a large magenta cape, a blue pearl necklace, and a purple sash around her waist over lavender cargo-pants and black shoes. After the timeskip, Devon's hair is much longer. She now sports a new outfit that makes her resemble more a classical pirate. She wears a bicorn hat decorated with a single rose and feathers on one side and a plume on the other, as well as the Blackbeard Pirates' Jolly Roger printed on the front, a corset that is longer on the back and extends all the way down to her knee area, a striped dress shirt, a cravat and heels that are slightly different from her previous ones. Her pants now have a pair of belts closing its hems. She also carries a sword on her right hip.", "personality": "Devon seems loyal to Blackbeard after he freed her from Impel Down. When the Marines recognized her for the first time, she mentioned that she \"likes them too\" which suggests that she is a somewhat sarcastic person. She also preferred to receive new clothes in exchange of the prisoners' uniform that she dislikes wearing. She is obsessed with collecting beautiful women's heads, such as when she declared that she admired the beauty of Boa Hancock and that her head would make a \"wonderful trophy\". Devon seems to have a romantic preference for women, as she is seen surrounding herself with adoring female admirers on Hachinosu, and was also affected by Boa Hancock's Devil Fruit ability. She has a sadistic side, as seen when she mocked Gecko Moria over the death of his subordinate Absalom, whom she masqueraded as to give Moria a false sense of hope. Like other characters in One Piece, she has a distinct laughter: \"Murunfuffuffu\" (?, VIZ: \"Murun hu hu hu\").", "abilities_and_powers": "Over the two-year timeskip, Catarina Devon has become promoted to the Captain of the Sixth Ship serves as a testament of Teach's trust in her powers, along with granting her the authority over the lower-ranking members Catarina Devon is one of the most powerful female pirates to have ever lived and when she was imprisoned in Impel Down, she was placed in level 6 were only the worst criminals in the world are locked up. Another testament to her power is the fact that when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he only chose the strongest ones that could survive when pitted against everyone else in a free-for-all battle. Thus, Catarina Devon is one of the strongest Level 6 prisoners. She is strong enough to injure even Whitebeard using her spear although Whitebeard was already greatly weakened at that point. She has been also shown to have great superhuman endurance, taking both a Gura Gura no Mi shock wave from Whitebeard (albeit not a direct hit) and Sengoku's shock wave in his Buddha form and getting up rather easily. Devon ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Kyubi no Kitsune, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transform into a nine-tailed fox. With this power, she can transform into clones of people similar to the Mane Mane no Mi. She is proficient with using a whip. She is seen wielding a spear or a staff when attacking Whitebeard with her crew as it was the weapon available at the time. While unclear in the manga, the anime shows it is a spear. After the timeskip, she has obtained a sword and wears it on her right side."},
{"name": "Carrot", "episode": "Episode 804", "chapter": "Chapter 753", "year": 2015, "note": "", "appearance": "Carrot is a white-furred, blonde-haired rabbit mink with brown eyes, rabbit ears, a rabbit-like nose, a large round fluffy tail, but with a body otherwise similar to that of a human adolescent girl. She seems to be short when compared to normal-sized people like Roronoa Zoro, Wanda, Sanji, or even Nami. In her first appearance, she wore a short orange dress with laced-up open sides with the Guardians' signature green cape, a single rabbit paw-like gauntlet, and brown, high-heeled boots. Upon sneaking aboard the Thousand Sunny, she changed to a similar short orange dress with the word \"RABBIT\" at the front with a thick darker orange trim and a single white stripe in the middle, a black cap, and yellow loafers. She also had a backpack and a canteen. Later on, she was seen wearing another short orange dress with a puffy skirt and a hood, and retained her cap and loafers. After reaching Totto Land, Carrot donned a simple, light-green short-skirt dress decorated with three vertical stripes running down the center and frills at the bottom, neck, and sleeves, and tied up at the front with an orange bow, as well as a pair of orange dress shoes. An additional accessory includes an orange hat. At the meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, she wore a flapper-style outfit of a white cloche hat with a pink rose, a sleeveless white blouse with a frilly collar and pink ribbon, a frilly black skirt, and black pumps. Her outfit had different colors (yellow blouse, red skirt, and orange pumps) in the original \"Hope\" opening. At the start of the Wano Country Arc, she wore a simple short salmon pink halter dress with a carrot design and the word \"Ninjin\" (Japanese for \"Carrot\"), as well as frills at the bottom. After Kin'emon used his powers to disguise her as a kunoichi, Carrot donned a light polka-dotted veil concealing her ears, a light green kimono with orange and green floral prints, and simple straw sandals. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. Her outfit consists of a strapless green bikini armor, lighter green shoulder pads with white edges, and a furry magenta cape, however it appears black in the manga. During her training under Shishilian, she wore a red musketeer hat and a light-green dress with thin straps, and her hair was slightly shorter. When Carrot activates her Sulong form on a full moon, her eyes turn red, her ears grow larger, her hair and tail grow considerably and turn snow white in color, and they both emit Electro sparks. The fur around her neckline turns much thicker, vaguely resembling a lion's mane, and her claws become longer and sharper. Upon seeing this form, Nami considers it to be \"so beautiful.\" and Jinbe comments that \"it's quite mesmerizing.\"", "personality": "Carrot is very protective of the Mokomo Dukedom and is highly aggressive towards intruders. Like other minks, she refers to humans as \"lesser minks\". Carrot is also protective of people she cares about. When the Straw Hat Pirates were met by Germa 66, Carrot was willing to fight the evil army in order to protect them. She can also be very emotional; when Monkey D. Luffy ate poisonous fish skin and was left on the verge of death, Carrot begged him not to die and tearfully embraced him once the poison was sucked out of him. After Pedro sacrificed himself in a suicidal explosion, Carrot became devastated and cried profoundly before becoming enraged to where she attempted to take it out on Katakuri. Like a regular rabbit, she likes to gnaw on things, including people such as Luffy. She loves carrots to the point where her provisions for the trip to Whole Cake Island consisted entirely of them, and she ferociously attacked Luffy when she saw him eating her carrot. She also loves chocolate. Though feral and vicious when attacking someone, Carrot can be quickly calmed down if someone pats her head. Despite her warrior status, she seems to be naive and childish about serious matters and the world beyond Zou; she was easily excited by events new to her; when she heard Luffy was planning to crash Big Mom's party and ruin the wedding ceremony, she believed it would be exciting to take part in, not realizing the extreme danger she would be facing in doing so, and she was later surprised to hear that it would take several days to reach Whole Cake Island because of how big the ocean was, having believed that it was small enough to only warrant half a day's worth of provisions. Additionally, she is not familiar with some natural weather phenomena, having mistaken lightning for Electro upon witnessing it at sea. She has always wanted to see the outside world and go on an adventure, and upon her discovery aboard the Thousand Sunny, she begged Pedro not to take her home immediately out of fear of being berated by Wanda. She is apparently scared of ghosts as she was frightened by Brook's soul form. Despite her naivete, she has also proven that she can be rather clever and deceiving; she quickly devised a plot to use Charlotte Brle's mirror based powers against her and successfully fooled several Big Mom Pirates into thinking that they had captured her. Whenever she transforms into her Sulong form, Carrot seemingly becomes more confident and vicious in combat. However, despite her drastic change in appearance and abilities, she still maintained her original personality, as shown when she blushed while fighting Charlotte Daifuku's crew. However, she proved to be more cunning than usual, as when she removed the steering wheel off of Daifuku's ship to keep them from going after the Sunny, and when she tricked his genie into attacking its master's fleet.", "abilities_and_powers": "Carrot has proven to be a strong warrior. Upon noticing that Monkey D. Luffy was eating her carrot, an enraged Carrot quickly overwhelmed him before being calmed down, although this was an oversight on the part of the pirate; this prompted Pedro, an extremely strong mink warrior and captain of the Guardians to vouch for her usefulness in a fight. Carrot possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki. As a mink, Carrot is a natural-born fighter and can use Electro. Having been a Kingsbird, she possesses a large amount of stamina, which allows her to be active at all hours of the day. Carrot is immensely quick and agile, having effortlessly dodged a slash from Roronoa Zoro. She is also capable of flipping backward multiple times and attacking immediately afterwards. Carrot can levitate and jump in midair as well as jump extremely high. She is highly perceptive and has incredible reflexes, being able to notice Randolph's extremely quick ambush before Nami and Chopper did, and managing to pull them out of harm's way a split second before Randolph attacked them. Her immense speed is further shown when she instantly caught Diesel who is an extremely fast runner, despite him having a running start. Carrot is also physically very strong, as she is capable of carrying two large weights in her arms while still being able to run at the same time. She has incredible leg strength as she can topple a massive pot of boiling soup towards Brle with a kick. She is considerably durable, as she was able to sit back up after being stomped to the ground by Charlotte Katakuri, one of the Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Carrot is able to awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Carrot's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified, allowing her to take out multiple members of the Big Mom Pirates in the blink of an eye, and rip out the helm of Charlotte Daifuku's ship. Her gliding abilities have also improved, as she was able to glide from the crow's nest of the Thousand Sunny to Daifuku's ship a great distance away. Using this form has a risk as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long. She can revert back to her normal form by blocking her eyes from moonlight. Carrot is skilled at drawing, but she has a tendency to draw people very effeminately. She is able to draw the faces of the Sanji Retrieval Team from memory. According to herself, she is also very good at drawing maps. Carrot wears two clawed gauntlets on her hands that resemble rabbit paws. They were given to her by Pedro when he believed that she could not handle a sword. They are strong enough to clash evenly with Zoro's swords and can have Electro channeled through them. When she encountered Luffy's group back when they first arrived on Zou, she wore a gauntlet only on her right hand."},

Although she appeared to be a benevolent woman who cared for her children like a mother with a ceaseless smile, this was all an act in order to maintain her business, and she did not truly care about her children's well-being beyond ensuring they were fit to sell.

Working with the government, she managed to fool the nation of Elbaf into thinking she wanted to help them by staging a rescue of the Giant Warrior Pirates. Her speech of benevolence and mercy even moved the condemned giant pirates to tears. The giants of Elbaf, including Jorul and Jarul, even held great respect for Carmel's claimed ideology in pacifism despite their dedication to militarism. She could also care for dozens of children of many varieties even in her old age, most notably Charlotte Linlin, as she was one of the few people whose words could quell Linlin's impulses. However, her capabilities were not absolute, as Linlin eventually snapped and went on a rampage after a week without food. A renowned seller in the Underworld, Carmel had connections to people as powerful as Cipher Pol and directly aided them by providing them with child spies. She was able to successfully negotiate an immensely high price for Linlin despite their initial hesitance. In return, the government gave her help in establishing good relations with Elbaf. Carmel ate the Soru Soru no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allowed her to manifest and manipulate the souls of herself and other people. She was shown manifesting her own soul and putting a fragment of it in a rampaging fire to create a sun homie named Pandora, subduing the flames to save an Elbaf village. The powers of the fruit were later seen manifested in Charlotte Linlin after Carmel's disappearance."},

He wears a coat which appears to be made of fur, dark on the outside and lighter and spotted on the inside (similar to a leopard's), draped over his shoulders like a cape, dark pants and shoes, and an extremely long-sleeved shirt (which at Sabaody was covered in blood) with a Cross fleury-like design on the chest. With the way he wears his shirt, concealing his arms under his long sleeves, it resembles an unbuckled straitjacket. After being found and looked after by an old woman on a winter island in the New World, Caribou is seen wearing a coat, which has a darker color than his previous one and a fluffy collar, draped onto his shoulders. He is also wearing plaid pajamas and thick winter boots. He soon went back to wearing his old long sleeved attire, but then wears a revolutionary uniform jacket draped over his shoulders, along with a beret with a star on it. After becoming a prisoner in Wano Country, Caribou kept his long sleeve shirt, but acquired standard prisoner striped pants and tattered trousers, as well as handcuffs and sandals.", "personality": "Caribou is an insanely violent man who is well-known for killing people, most prominently Marines, by burying them alive. Caribou believes in God, and frequently justifies his murders by claiming to do it for the sake of his god. He will also ask his god to forgive enemies that work against him, showing a very egotistical personality. Caribou seeks the fame of killing important people, and is constantly plotting ways to target his next victim; he joined what was seemingly the Straw Hat Pirates in order to kill their members from within, and sought to attack the real Straw Hats as soon as they appeared. He is extremely prideful, as he decided to shoot a Marine rather than use him as a shield like the Fake Straw Hat Crew commanded because the Marine had lied to him. He also seems to be overconfident in his Logia Devil Fruit power, as he dismissed Pekoms' Zoan ability and attacked him with no caution, causing Pekoms to defeat him with one blow. Caribou is very greedy and loves to get money and treasure by any means necessary. He has no problem with selling captives on the slave market, and upon reaching Fish-Man Island he immediately took the opportunity to kidnap as many mermaids as possible to sell them, only releasing them once he managed to steal the Ryugu Palace's entire treasury. When he saw Pekoms and Tamago walking away with his stolen treasure, Caribou immediately became angry and rushed to attack them, causing him to be quickly defeated. Caribou is also rather lecherous, as he immediately started ogling Nami upon seeing her, contemplated hiding in the women's quarters on the Thousand Sunny, and took great pleasure when talking to the group of mermaids he captured. He likes to use his Devil Fruit abilities to move around in disguise and listen in on conversations that reveal things he can take advantage of. Upon hearing of the Ancient Weapons, Caribou became very interested in their potential to destroy the entire world, and sought to kidnap Poseidon and divulge Pluton's location to a certain individual. Caribou prioritizes his own safety at all times and will almost always attempt to escape whenever he encounters a situation that he recognizes is too dangerous for him. He will even abandon his comrades to get to safety, as shown when he left his crew behind to fight the Marines at the G-5 base. When he is surrounded by enemies with no way of escape, Caribou will try to stay alive by pledging to serve them, although people typically know his oaths of fealty are lies. Caribou will use other people around him to his advantage whenever possible, as he tried teaming up with Monkey D. Luffy in the Prisoner Mine to work toward escaping and get more meal tickets. However, he was much less willing to help Luffy in his quest to take down Emperor Kaidou himself, and when he and the Straw Hats encountered a kraken on the way to Fish-Man Island, he begged for them to flee from it. When his pleading was unsuccessful, he gave the Straw Hats the idea to send fighters out in bubbles to keep the kraken from attacking their ship and dooming him. During his cover story, however, Caribou appeared to grow more conscientious of others. When a granny nursed him back to health, he was initially willing to let her be beaten by Scotch, but he had a change of heart and returned to the island with his crew to save her and the factory workers; this culminated in him protecting the granny from X Drake at all costs. Like many other characters, he has a distinct laughter style, starting with \"Kehihihi\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As co-captain of the Caribou Pirates, Caribou has authority over his crew alongside his brother Coribou. Caribou is a strong pirate, gaining Super Rookie status while successfully traversing Paradise, the first half of the Grand Line. With his Devil Fruit powers, he has become well-known as a menace to the Marines by killing many of them, allowing him to gain a 210,000,000 bounty. Caribou and his crew were able to easily round up the members of the Fake Straw Hat Crew aside from their captain, and they were powerless to stop Caribou. Additionally, he led his crew and freedom-fighting citizens to a swift victory against Scotch of the Beasts Pirates primarily by overwhelming the enemy with his Devil Fruit power. Along with his crew, Caribou also showed the ability to tame the large sea beast Momoo and get it to pull their ship down toward Fish-Man Island. When engaging in physical combat, Caribou relies almost solely on his Devil Fruit power and has no knowledge of Haki. His real body is not very durable, as he has frequently been defeated in one blow by opponents who can use Busoshoku Haki such as Luffy, Pekoms, Jinbe, and X Drake. Caribou ate the Numa Numa no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into \"swamp\". His transformed body has the characteristics of mud, though it is arguably closer to quicksand, which allows him to absorb things into it. Additionally, his body is a \"bottomless swamp\", giving him an infinite amount of space inside his elemental body. Caribou is capable of storing a massive number of objects inside his body by having them sink into his swamp, and can hold them in until he chooses to release them or he loses consciousness. Caribou can fit very large objects inside his body, including an entire weapons factory, and can also store people, allowing him to capture others with greater ease; if someone is caught in his swamp and tries to resist being pulled in, they only sink faster. Caribou stores a large amount of weapons in his body, allowing him to pull them out whenever he wishes and use them unexpectedly. He can also smother people with his swamp, and transform his entire body to sneak around places undetected. Caribou used some sort of spear or polearm to stab the Marine who was spying at the Fake Straw Hats meeting point. He was also seen wielding a flintlock pistol. During his battle with Pekoms on Fish-Man Island, he used a Gatling gun and a scythe, hiding them within the infinite space of his swamp body."},

{"name": "Capone Bege", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Bege is a short man with a stocky build whose appearance is somewhat similar to that of a Mafia boss. He sports an oiled-up and slicked-back hairstyle befitting that of a crime don. His facial features have a very stern look to them further accentuated by his rather sharp but hooking beak-like nose. He also has five o'clock stubble on his upper lip. He wears a black-and-white pinstriped attire, complete with a green scarf around his neck, with the excess tucked inside the suit (making it look like a cravat). Like Crocodile, Bege wears very expensive golden rings with precious stones mounted on them, but because Bege has two hands, all his fingers (including the thumbs) have them. As for his personal effects, he has a pirate captain's coat with red and gold trimming and a fedora hat, both of which he only seems to wear for traveling purposes. He is often seen smoking a cigar, except when eating. In an SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Bege is shown as a kid with a curlier hair and a shorter and rounder head. He wore a shirt and tie. He was also depicted as playing with guns, knives, and a fortress made of blocks, referencing his Devil Fruit abilities. After the timeskip, he grew a thick goatee and now wears a darker hat. During the Zou Arc, he sported a pair of sunglasses resembling those worn by Pekoms. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Bege wore a rose on the left breast of his suit, keeping it in subsequent appearances.", "personality": "Despite being a notorious pirate and a former mobster with a shady reputation, Bege cultivates a refined, sophisticated (yet still frightening) image that is rather appropriate to his mafia roots. He dresses himself in fine suits and enjoys fine dining while on board his ship at sea. He is strongly appalled by things like bad table manners and rudeness, usually maintaining a reserved and calm demeanor. Bege is very particular about cleanliness and hygiene, refusing to have a meeting with anyone who does not present themself properly, forcing even his enemies to do so. When meeting Sanji for the first time, he offered him food and drinks, in an apparent act of hospitality and politeness. For so long as he is not agitated, Bege appears to be a reasonable pirate who is willing to negotiate and prefers to avoid making a scene, with the intent of dodging unnecessary confrontations with enemies he may find inconvenient, such as an Admiral or a powerful warrior tribe. In spite of his apparent seriousness, Bege can be very impatient and ill-tempered, being not at all above injuring other people, even his own crew, should they provoke his ire even in the slightest. Though he may not always be inclined to fight, Bege is a fearless man who will not hesitate to confront someone should it prove beneficial or necessary, regardless of how strong they might be. His Devil Fruit plays a large role in that thanks to its defensive, strategic nature and reliance on sheer numbers. When Bege does engage in battle, he tends to just walk into danger on his own, since he can easily summon numerous subordinates at any time and place to fight on his behalf. Bege is extremely sadistic, bloodthirsty and is known for decapitating even animals simply for entertainment. He does not crave power himself, but rather aims to destabilize the factions in power and watch the resulting struggle for power for his own entertainment. Everywhere he goes, he takes out the leaders of the groups opposing him in order to achieve this, only caring for his opponents' treasure and the bloodshed he will see from them later. His enjoyment of chaos does not exclude that which is caused by someone other than himself. Bege hysterically laughed upon the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau and the potential fall of the Big Mom Pirates, showcasing how much he is amused by the demise of the mighty and powerful. Despite this bloodthirsty nature though, Bege does have some degree of mercy and self-control. According to Jinbe, while he slaughtered leaders of powerful organizations, he left their subordinates alone and only viciously retaliated when they attempted revenge. Bege can be very cunning and pragmatic, not being above taking hostages, bluffing, or shooting people in the back in order to accomplish his goals. Highly opportunistic, Bege is always on the lookout for a potential weakness or opening from the enemy, having no qualms in exploiting it to the maximum. His plan to assassinate Big Mom involved destroying a photo of Mother Carmel, a precious figure of her past, having observed and correctly deducted that she lost her usual incredible toughness while suffering from a mental breakdown caused by the photo being slightly damaged. Later, after he seemingly accepted Oven's demands to surrender for Chiffon's safety, he took a shot at Oven while the latter's guard was down. He also withheld information that his ship could travel on land with tank trends, enabling him to surprise the Big Mom Pirates while retrieving Chiffon and escape Cacao Island. While those moments may indicate that Bege is highly untrustworthy, he is noted by his wife, Chiffon, to always honor his deals and promises, regardless of the outcome of his schemes. In addition, Sanji has proved that it is possible for Bege to leave his pragmatism aside if he ends up convinced that an alternative can be just as successful, even if it may sound ridiculous in theory. Bege has occasionally shown a prideful side, bragging about the fact that he is also part of the Worst Generation, just like Luffy. While he has never shown a specific interest on fame or power, Bege holds his strategic plans in high regard and has the utmost faith in his own tactical wit. His proposals tend to be quite meticulous, making sure that every variable is accounted and possible setbacks are taken care of (although unpredictable wild cards like Luffy himself can still humorously catch him off guard). Despite his elaborate schemes, Bege never really boasts about the ingenuity or success rate of his plans, but he was still displeased upon reading an article that portrayed and credited Luffy as the mastermind behind Big Mom's failed assassination plot. After becoming a father and husband, Bege seems to have lessened his cruel and ruthless behavior to some extent. He is not above acting foolish in front of others to entertain his son and shows love towards his wife in various situations. Bege may also show appreciation towards his subordinates or outsiders that he has no hostile relationships with as long as they demonstrate enough competency. However, Bege does not like to be thought as a good person, finding disgust at the idea of people feeling gratefulness towards him. While Bege outwardly considers empathy towards others to be weakness and cowardliness, unbefitting of pirates, he has shown to deeply care for his family and crew, risking his own life against Big Mom if it meant protecting the few people that are close to him and refusing to abandon them. In the Funimation Dub, he talks with 1930's gangster slang, such as referring to his eyes as his \"own two peepers\", or referring to Charlotte Katakuri as \"dis Bruno\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of his crew and leader of one of the Five Families of the West, Bege has authority over all those under him. He also had great influence and power over the Underworld operations in the West Blue. As a rook combatant within the Big Mom Pirates, he was given the responsibility of being in charge of the Tea Party's security. Bege has an excellent awareness of his surroundings. After taking Nami and Chopper hostage while bargaining with Sanji and Brook at Zou, he knew that Caesar was hiding nearby, while Sanji and Brook were completely unaware of the presence of the three. In addition, Bege has a strong will since he did not lose consciousness when Big Mom released a wave of Haoshoku Haki upon focusing on the broken picture of Mother Carmel, an event which caused many of the people present to faint. Bege is a masterful strategist known for his clever utilization of tactics and trickery, rather than direct physical force, in battle. Contrary to his fellow pirates of the Worst Generation, who defeat their enemies with immense fighting power, Bege has defeated several infamous pirate captains of the Grand Line with his tactical genius alone. Even before he became a pirate; as a mafia don, Bege could ruthlessly and effectively eliminate all of his rival mafias, from their leaders to their vengeful subordinates and hired assassins, through this same ingenuity. After becoming a pirate, his tactical skills and ruthlessness only helped further his pirate career and power his way through the dangerous seas of the Grand Line, to the point where he became infamously known for his success in planning and executing assassinations. In fact, he noted that his failure to assassinate Big Mom was the first plan that ever failed. To match his tactical prowess, Bege is extremely observant and analytical of his surroundings, able to detect potential weaknesses in powerful enemies and devise strategies to exploit said weaknesses. During the Mother Carmel photo incident, Bege was able to perceive how Big Mom's body completely lost its tremendous resilience after someone accidentally dropped the photo of Mother Carmel. Bege even managed to estimate the time gap between dropping the photo and when Big Mom's tantrum started. Bege has incredible understanding of psychological warfare, capable of correctly deducing and anticipating an opponent's actions solely by noticing their unconscious behavior, something he demonstrated against Charlotte Katakuri, whose paleness that came as a result of foreseeing of a horrifying future allowed Bege to confidently proceed with his assassination plan. Bege is also a deceptive master of bluffing and coercion. Even Caesar Clown, a highly crafty and manipulative expert liar in his own right, was tricked into surrendering himself thanks to Bege's effective lies about death threats. A resourceful man, Bege will employ all manners of convenient people, tools and weapons to ensure the success of his schemes, such as a Seastone spear to capture Logia Devil Fruit users, ear plugs for defense against sonic attacks and a mirror that became an effective escape route thanks to the user of the Mira Mira no Mi being kept under his power. Having joined the Big Mom Pirates with the sole intent of taking out Big Mom himself, Bege carefully covered all his bases to maximize his already unlikely chances of success, utilizing code names in order to confuse Big Mom's children and silencing any homies that could potentially rat out his scheme. Bege has a cunning talent for being well-prepared and keeping trump cards hidden from friends and foes alike, pulling them out should the situation call for it. He deliberately kept the Nostra Castello's function to travel on land with tank treads a secret from the Big Mom Pirates, which later allowed the Fire Tank Pirates to rescue Chiffon and escape from Oven without much difficulty. Bege can think and adapt extremely quickly even in dire times of extreme danger, allowing him to come up with improvised maneuvers and tactics should those he executed initially fail to meet the expected result. Bege's main strategy during combat situations is to use his Devil Fruit abilities to launch ambushes and surprise attacks carried off by his subordinates, a testament to Bege's formidable leadership and opportunistic sense. Bege's soldiers are numerous and tend to quickly move into battle, all while performing with ruthless efficiency, cornering their enemies before they can react and taking weaker individuals as hostages to increase their leverage over stronger targets. It was thanks to this thoroughness that Bege was able to subdue half of the Straw Hat Pirates and hold the reins of their confrontation (as put by Sanji), right after backstabbing Pekoms. Bege was also intelligent enough to keep this whole encounter as quiet as possible, fully knowing that any loud noises could end up alerting the Mink Tribe and thus jeopardize the mission. Bege is physically fit and has a strong tolerance to pain, as he could withstand having his body in his Big Father Form being smashed apart by Big Mom while calmly thinking up of a getaway tactic. Shortly after escaping the Whole Cake Chateau, Bege recovered enough to quickly flee despite some bleeding. Bege is an extraordinary master in marksmanship. With a Tommy gun, Bege could land multiple accurate shots on Katakuri, which caught the latter off-guard; an extremely notable feat as the Katakuri is noted to be an exceptional master of Kenbunshoku Haki, with the ability to see slightly ahead into the future. From an extremely far distance, Bege managed to fire a direct pistol shot at Charlotte Oven's head with pinpoint precision from his ship at sea, without hurting his wife, Chiffon. Due to his Devil Fruit and the cannons and various firearms he houses in his body, Bege's marksmanship skills are further enhanced, giving him and his crew the option and ability to fire cannons and other artillery from within his own body in the form of ambushes. Bege ate the Shiro Shiro no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that effectively makes him a miniature fortress. His body is equipped with cannons and he has a small pocket dimension inside his body that resembles the inside of a castle, including furniture. He can also manifest cannon ports and a drawbridge on his person. Anyone or thing that enters his body will be shrunken down and return to normal size once they leave. He can house a large number of people within his body, as well as horses, and he can manifest a duplicate of himself within the castle. This gives him a massive force of subordinates to call on at all times, and he can conduct meetings in private. It also gives him a place to keep prisoners. Additionally, Bege can control everything within his castle body. The inside of Bege's castle body doesnt experience any exterior punishment that Bege experiences. If Bege takes a hit from an opponent and gets knocked down, people inside the castle dont experience any turbulence. The only exception is the manifestation of Bege inside the castle, who gets knocked around as his outer body does. He is also capable of changing his body to gain fortress-like attributes, such as tank treads. He can even turn into a gigantic fortress-like golem with immense defensive power. Bege's internal body contains several cannons which his subordinates can use in order to fire at nearby targets outside their captain's fortress body. Bege has a spear made of Seastone which he had one of his subordinates use in order to restrain Caesar Clown. When Bege shot Pekoms on Whole Cake Island, he wielded a simple flintlock pistol, using the same against Oven to save his wife at Cacao Island. For use in assassinating the Vinsmoke Family, he and other members of the Big Mom Pirates were given Walkers. As he betrayed the Big Mom Pirates, Bege pulled out a Tommy gun, which he also favors throughout his adventure at Dressrosa. When Big Mom started her strange scream, Bege used a KX Launcher in his attempt to assassinate Big Mom."},

{"name": "Camie", "episode": "Episode 195", "chapter": "Chapter 385", "year": 2001, "note": "She was formally introduced in Chapter 490.", "appearance": "Camie is a young kissing gourami mermaid, and as a reference to the type of fish she is, she always expresses a very distinct face-fault whenever she is shocked by something. Whenever she expresses shock, her eyes typically pops out as commonly seen in manga and anime. Her face-fault is always shown with a very wide open mouth that shows her teeth and her tongue is usually seen sticking out in an up and down, zigzag manner. In the anime, she is shown with green hair and dark purple eyes. When she first met the Straw Hats, she wore a yellow and pink t-shirt that exposed her stomach and she wore an orange backpack where she carried her takoyaki. Camie has a pink tail with light fins, and her dorsal fin is white. Previously, her only color depiction came from the Ocean's Dream! - Oceans of Dreams game in which she had blue hair and a yellow tail. Because of Oda's change in style since he first drew her, Camie has had a few changes in appearance. The first is an addition of a dorsal fin along her spine. While Camie's overall appearance has not changed much after the two-year timeskip, she appears more feminine. Her mermaid fish tail is generally longer and slimmer and her caudal fin is now larger and more curvy. Her hair, rather than being parted down the middle, is parted to her right and is dyed. She now wears a spaghetti-strap top with a jagged lower hem that exposes her stomach instead of a t-shirt, but still from Pappag's Criminal brand. She also wears a necklace with beads and a bracelet on her right wrist shaped like flowers. In the anime, Camie's hair has become a brighter shade of green.", "personality": "Camie has a habit of being easily shocked. Anything from a simple mistake, to a large shocking situation makes her shocked to a degree greater than any other normal person would be. Camie and her starfish, Pappag, also have the most unfortunate luck of getting eaten by large sea kings almost every time they go out. By the time she first met the Straw Hats, she had been swallowed twenty times. Camie also has the unfortunate luck of getting captured almost every time she goes out, though it is likely because she is so nave and gullible. Before she was captured by Macro and his crew once again in the Flying Fish Rider's base, she had been previously captured by the Fish-Man Pirates thirty times. Fortunately for her, somebody is usually around to save her. Since the first time meeting him, this has usually been Hatchan. Camie has a habit of referring to humans in a unique way. Instead of simply saying human and humans, she says human person and human people respectively. She also tends to address others with the suffix \"Chin\" added to their names in a similar fashion as how \"San\" and \"Chan\" are used in Japanese to address others. She would thus address Luffy as Luffy-chin, Nami as Nami-chin, Hatchan as Hatchin, and so on. While Camie is currently working part-time at the Mermaid Cafe and for Hatchan's Takoyaki business, she dreams of becoming a famous fashion designer like her master, Pappag. As said before, she is nave and gullible, but she is also very kind, caring, and open-hearted and due to her navet she has no problem with trusting strangers, such as the Straw Hat Pirates when she just met them. In situations with a sexual or relationship-like nature, she is either very shy and misunderstanding or just unknowing, such as when she blushed when Shakky asked if she was Hatchan's girlfriend and when she did not understand how she gave Sanji a nosebleed by putting his head between her breasts. Two years later, while not having completely lost her navet and quirks, she appears more thoughtful, mature and independent, as she now lives on her own without Hatchan or Pappag. She acts as Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp's sensible guide to Fish-Man Island and actually was quick to take charge of the group when Sanji got in trouble by losing a lot of blood.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being a mermaid, Camie has several abilities unique to her race. She has the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is apparently only audible to them. Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the Flying Fish Riders.

In the manga, his hair appears black. However, in the anime his hair is light green where it is shaved and dark green where it is longer. He is usually seen wearing a large blue and white checkered scarf that covers the lower portion of his face, a sleeveless brown coat (purple in the anime) reaching down to his knees, white pants larger near the end and held up by a white sash (light blue in the anime), and white shoes.

Cabaji's primary fighting style, known as Carnival Tricks, combines swordplay and acrobatics to distract and take advantage of his opponents. It incorporates a variety of circus props and feats, including Cabaji's signature unicycle and tops, sword swallowing, and fire breathing. Along with his acrobatic skills, which he uses to glide to enormous heights on his unicycle, he has displayed a fondness for using both daggers and a sword during his fights, not unlike his captain. He also uses razor-sharp spinning tops and has a flame breath. He can also swallow swords with ease, as witnessed when he pulls out a sword from his mouth when the town mayor comes to challenge Buggy. Also, if necessary, in Chibi Buggy Pirate Adventure, he has shown to be fairly skilled in hand to hand combat after his sword was broken."},
{"name": "Buggy", "episode": "Episode 9", "chapter": "Chapter 4", "year": 1997, "note": "He was first mentioned by the Tightrope Walking Funan Bros in Chapter 8.", "appearance": "Buggy is a slim blue-haired man with an appearance resembling that of a clown, as to mirror his epithet. The big, red nose on his face is, in fact, his real nose. Buggy's face is always covered with makeup, just like a clown, and the motifs change from time to time: in his first appearance he had crossbones going down his face forming an X; he also had two blue lines near both of his eyes, red lipstick and his jolly roger on his hat. However, in later episodes after the Loguetown Arc his look changes. First, a green star appears in the middle of the forehead, two half circles appear beneath the eyes, and there is a straight line on the middle of his chin. After that (when his crew meets Ace), he has two green dots on both sides of his head and four big green dots on the rim of his hat, which still has the jolly roger on it. He also has green eyeliner and green lipstick, with a curvy line going down both sides of his face. In the Impel Down saga, he has crossbones again going down his forehead to below his eyes, two pink lines pointing up, and red lipstick. In his pirate captain attire, he dons a striped white and red shirt with short sleeves, white gloves reminiscent of the ones worn by clowns, a sash around his waist like many other pirates, and a pair of loose pants reaching to his calves, just above a pair of striped socks and pointy shoes. He also has a scarf around his neck. Hanging from his shoulders there is an orange, fur-lined captain's coat. On his head he has an orange hat with his jolly roger on it, over a neckerchief with the same pattern of his shirt. While in the manga his scarf and sash are orange just like many other components of his attire, his pants are light-brown and the epaulets of his coat are simply gold, in the anime he was given a much brighter color scheme, with a purple scarf, green sash, light-green pants, and green epaulets. In Impel Down, he wore a striped prisoner outfit and wore his hair in a ponytail. After escaping from the Grand Prison, he changed his prisoner uniform with clothes like the one he normally wears, with salvaged Marine uniform pieces to recreate the effects of a pirate captain: a white coat and a white tricorn that had the Marine symbols crossed out. As a young man serving aboard Gol D. Roger's ship, he looked mostly the same; the only notable differences were his shorter hair and smaller stature. He wore a different outfit in each flashback but dressed similarly to how he does now, usually seen in striped T-shirts (or collared shirts), white gloves, baggy pants, pointed shoes, and donning a sash. He wore beanies rather than a captain's hat and he lacked the captain's coat. It was revealed in an SBS Volume 4 question that the blue tassels coming from the sides of Buggy's hat are his actual hair in the shape of two ponytails. While in the confines of Impel Down, Buggy's long hair is tied into just one ponytail. After the timeskip, Buggy's appearance has changed greatly. His hair is not tied anymore and now looks spikier. He wears a big red and white, striped tricorn with a rim ornated with several golden little balls and his crew's Jolly Roger on the front. He wears a big, red cloak, using his Devil Fruit powers to make himself appear larger. In the Boss Luffy Historical Special episodes, he has long pink hair, a green ribbon in the front, and a white face with red and blue lines. He wears an orange kimono, with blue shoulder pads that have his Jolly Roger drawn, with two yellow lines crossed behind, and a blue and red ribbon at the waist. He also wears white gloves (different from the canon storyline), and sandals. In the 3D2Y special, he dresses in a similar way to his appearance in Orange Town, with the difference of his shirt and sash are with the colors in Marineford, and the shoulder pads in his coat are gold. In the video game One Piece: World Seeker, Buggy wears his hair in a ponytail, and sunglasses with star-shaped lenses. On his neck he wears a purple scarf and a gold collar, and he wears a green shirt with printed flowers, which he has unbuttoned, leaving his torso in sight, orange shorts with a red and white striped scarf at the waist, and sandals. He also wears his white gloves, and Captain John's armband on his left arm. In One Piece: Stampede, in his \"Star Clown\" appearance he is wearing an orange and white captain coat on the shoulders, and a pink cravat. In his original appearance, he is shown with yellow hair, and a black hat with a Jolly Roger. He wears a white shirt, pants with pink and yellow vertical stripes, fastened by light blue suspenders, and an orange coat on the shoulders. He also wears brown shoes and socks with white and light blue stripes.", "personality": "Buggy is very vain and egotistical and seeks to be glorified and feared by others. When he was nine years old, he complained that the Whitebeard Pirates were receiving more attention in the newspaper than his crew, the Roger Pirates. He does not spend much of his time improving his own abilities to become a powerful fighter, but rather focuses mainly on recruiting powerful subordinates who do the hard work while simultaneously being subjected to him. If presented with an opportunity to make himself look good and recruit powerful followers, Buggy will take it. Whenever someone strokes his ego, even if it is due to an inaccurate impression of him, Buggy will revel in it and start getting delusions of grandeur; when the Impel Down escapees praised him for being on Roger's crew, Buggy started considering that their support could help him take down Whitebeard or even become the Pirate King. Buggy is a showman, and his actions are frequently designed to bring attention to himself. He injects the word \"flashy\" (, hade ni?), into almost every sentence he speaks (\"Flashily die! You flashy bastard!\"), and frequently uses it to describe his actions, such as giving Monkey D. Luffy a \"flashy execution\" in Loguetown. In that attempted execution, he made his entrance by blowing up a fountain, and allowed his crew to run wild while he executed Luffy atop the platform where Gol D. Roger was famously killed. During the Summit War of Marineford, he had his followers broadcast his exploits to the outside world with a stolen Den Den Mushi, and after becoming a Warlord of the Sea during the timeskip, he uses his Devil Fruit abilities in conjunction with a large robe to make himself look much bigger than he actually is. In addition to wanting followers, Buggy loves to find treasure and spends most of his time following maps leading to great riches; when he was on the Roger Pirates, he stated that the most important thing to a pirate is the physical treasure they find. Buggy is extremely possessive over the treasure he takes and will kill anyone who attempts to steal from him. When Shanks accidentally caused him to lose a treasure map during their apprentice days, Buggy developed a grudge against him that has lasted for three decades. When the Roger Pirates went to Skypiea, Buggy was very attracted to the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell and was disappointed when Roger decided not to take it. Buggy was even willing to guide Luffy through Impel Down in exchange for an armband pointing to Captain John's treasure, though did not intend to fully honor the deal especially after Luffy gave him the armband in advance. When asked by Shanks on Marineford to return Luffy's straw hat, Buggy immediately did so upon being promised a treasure map in return and was extremely angry when he found out Shanks was lying. Buggy is extremely prideful; when he failed to kill Luffy, Zoro, and Nami for stealing from him and defying him, he said that it would bring great shame upon him and his crew to let them go free. After Luffy defeated him, Buggy made it his mission to hunt down and kill him for simply angering him. He is prone to underestimating opponents that he knows nothing about, as he initially mistook Luffy for a common thief and believed that Luffy was much weaker than him until being defeated by him; he initially paid much more attention to Zoro due to having heard of the swordsman before. In Impel Down, Buggy's lack of knowledge about vice warden Hannyabal caused him to assume that he and Galdino had a chance of beating him, causing them to attack him and get easily beaten. Buggy also angrily confronted Portgas D. Ace as an enemy until finding out who he was. When the Roger Pirates battled the Whitebeard Pirates for four days, Marco noted that Buggy and Shanks both had impressively stoic attitudes for young pirate apprentices. Buggy is extremely sensitive about his big red nose and will immediately execute anyone who points it out, usually by blowing them up with a Buggy Ball. He frequently tends to mishear people as talking about his nose when in reality they are talking about something completely different, and sometimes he even mistakes his own speech as referring to his nose and gets angry at people around him for it. Despite his prideful and vain attitude, Buggy is aware of the many dangers of the Grand Line and typically does not commit rash actions that would put him in trouble, to the point of acting cowardly. When the Roger Pirates came into conflict with the Golden Lion Pirates and their massive fleet, a 12-year-old Buggy worriedly pleaded for Roger to comply with Golden Lion captain Shiki's request. When Ace fell asleep on his ship, Buggy ordered his crew not to kill him as he knew that doing so would unleash Whitebeard's wrath on them. When teaming up with Luffy, who wanted to go to the lowest level of Impel Down to save Ace, Buggy wished to stay on the highest level possible and avoid the prison's powerful guards. When escaping from Impel Down, Buggy went along with Jinbe, Crocodile, and Daz Bonez to commandeer a Marine ship in order to stay away from the warden Magellan. When he witnessed Whitebeard die after battling the Marine admirals and Blackbeard Pirates, Buggy immediately became afraid and flew away from the battleground, not caring if his followers saw him as cowardly. However, Buggy may commit rash actions if compelled by his emotions; when Dracule Mihawk sliced him into many pieces during the Summit War of Marineford, Buggy got angry at him and shot a Muggy Ball at him without thinking, causing Mihawk to deflect it back at him. When Crocodile and Mihawk confronted him for his unintentional usurpation of presidency of the Cross Guild, he showed tremendous cowardice by crying and pleading for mercy, even offering to lick their shoes clean, and upon being made figurehead leader under the two superior pirates, he became worried for his future. Buggy can often be cruel and selfish, even toward his comrades. While operating in the East Blue, he regularly raided and pillaged defenseless towns before destroying them as he pleased and would kill anyone who opposed him without hesitation. If one of his subordinates fails to accomplish a task, Buggy will become very angry at them and may abuse them. When a Buggy Ball was flying toward him and his crew, Buggy used two of his crewmates as shields without any remorse. After losing his Warlord position and being confronted by a Marine fleet, Buggy plotted to escape in secret while the rest of his forces fought the Marines. When teaming up with Luffy in Impel Down, Buggy frequently looked for ways to split away from him and pursue his own goal of escaping, even if it meant going back on his word or leaving Luffy in a perilous situation. When Luffy gave him Captain John's armband in advance and let him go off even before they had agreed to, Buggy was baffled by his kindness. While with the Roger Pirates, he kept a treasure map from them without telling anyone and pretended to eat the Devil Fruit the crew had in order to sell the real one, valuing gaining wealth for himself over contributing to the crew. Buggy is willing to do whatever it takes to win and aid his comrades in battle, as shown when he attempted to restrain Zoro to allow Cabaji to strike him. Although, despite his cowardness he ultimately spoke up against Crocodile's goal and criticized him deeming it not a way a pirate should go and wishing to achieve his desire go to the top and become Pirate King after learning Shanks had finally joined the race for the One Piece, something that both Crocodile and Mihawk found extremely delusional although Buggy intended to do so by taking the One Piece first rather than fight for it. Buggy appears to love eating and drinking, as he frequently engages in parties and banquets with his crew. When he was in Level 4 of Impel Down, he wanted to go with Luffy to break into the kitchen, and Galdino was forced to stop him from heading into an obvious ambush.", "abilities_and_powers": "As captain of the Buggy Pirates, Buggy has authority over his crew, which grew exponentially during the Impel Down Arc after he freed hundreds of powerful prisoners from Impel Down whose individual bounties are much higher than his own. After hearing that Buggy was once a member of the Roger Pirates, these prisoners came to heavily respect him and follow him wherever he went. The Emperor, Edward Newgate even noted that Buggy's new forces could disrupt his crew's ability to save Portgas D. Ace if they were against him, so he offered to form an alliance with Buggy during the Summit War of Marineford. Buggy's newfound authority created by his association with the Roger Pirates even attracted the attention of the World Government, who offered him a Warlord position. Buggy used this position to run a Mercenary business called Buggy's Delivery, where he had authority over a large number of powerful mercenaries including giants from Elbaf. However, now that the Seven Warlords System has been dissolved, Buggy returned to being an enemy, meaning he can no longer operate outside of the law as he pleases. Because of his alliance with Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile, in the form of Cross Guild, under his \"supposed\" leadership, Buggy became recognized as one of the Four Emperors and earned a bounty of 3,189,000,000. However, despite his high bounty and once being an apprentice with the renowned Roger Pirates, Buggy has never achieved the great strength and combat skills of his crewmates, particularly his fellow former apprentice and emperor Shanks. In fact, physically speaking and combat wise Buggy is relatively weak compared to most of the pirates operating in the New World. It is safe to say that the only reason he survived for as long as he did is because of his lies and manipulations and several misinterpretations of him with only a few people seeing though the ruse either for their high intelligence or because they know Buggy well enough to see the truth. For the most part, he is only truly dangerous against normal citizens and novice pirates in the weakest sea East Blue, though did manage to easily defeat the Kumate Tribe with the help of Alvida, Mohji, and Cabaji. However, Buggy is resilient, having sailed the Grand Line with the Roger Pirates and surviving the battles and perils they were in, including fights against opponents like the Golden Lion Pirates and Whitebeard Pirates. Buggy has also captained his own crew through the Grand Line and has survived its perils so far, and currently operates in the New World. Buggy was involved in the mass breakout of Impel Down and the Summit War of Marineford and survived, although he was rarely involved in direct combat and most of the fighters paid him little mind. Buggy mainly gets by with his craftiness; he frequently devises plans to unexpectedly overwhelm his opponents with his weapons and Devil Fruit. He allowed Roronoa Zoro to cut him into pieces and pretended to be dead in order to stab Zoro with a detached hand while he was off-guard. He was also able to trap Luffy on Gol D. Roger's execution platform and would have successfully executed him had lightning not struck the platform. Buggy is also a skilled inventor, as evidenced by his creation of extremely powerful ammunition like Buggy Balls and Muggy Balls that greatly aid in his destructive capabilities. While alone on an unknown island, he made a trap to attempt to catch a large bird, but the bird was not fooled. Additionally, Buggy is very opportunistic, and will frequently look to utilize other people to help him get out of trouble. This was most notably shown in Impel Down, where he freed hundreds of prisoners to get them to follow him and create a riot. When the Marines identified him as a former member of the Roger Pirates, Buggy decided to quickly utilize this to build up his own image. Although his efforts to be seen as great are frequently intentional, Buggy also benefited from a significant amount of luck when leading the Impel Down escapees, as even though he showed his cowardly nature multiple times, his words and actions were always misconstrued by the escapees as indicators of strength. Buggy possesses notable physical durability, as he quickly recovered after being hit by a Muggy Ball that Dracule Mihawk rebounded back toward him in Marineford. Although he avoided most of the damage by using his men as shields, Buggy was able to survive the explosion from a Buggy Ball that Luffy sent flying back at him and emerged from the wreckage of the collapsed tavern with no injuries. Additionally, although he does not have immunity to lightning like Luffy, he was able to quickly get back up after being struck on the Loguetown execution platform and immediately start chasing after Luffy. In Impel Down, he was able to walk through the extreme heat of Level 4 and extreme cold of Level 5 without suffering significant adverse effects. Buggy has a notable amount of physical strength, which is aided by his Devil Fruit allowing his hands to detach and fly. He was easily able to lift one of his men and Mayor Boodle off the ground by their necks with a single detached hand. Additionally, he was able to lift a massive Blugori high into the air with both of his detached hands, as well as carry Luffy and the very large fish-man Jinbe in the air with just his hands holding them against his torso. He was also able to throw Mohji a great distance forward despite Mohji being slightly bigger than him. According to Shanks, Buggy was a very good swimmer, but he lost this ability after eating his Devil Fruit. Buggy ate the Bara Bara no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to split his body into pieces and reassemble them at will. This power also makes him immune to slashing attacks. With the exception of his feet, Buggy can make his disassembled body parts levitate and control them telekinetically. He can launch his body parts at high speed, allowing him to strike a distant target with strong force. He can also split his body to dodge opponents' attacks by detaching the section of his body that would have taken the attack and making it fly out of the way. Furthermore, his body parts remain connected to each other, even when they are separated. For example, if his hand is detached, he can still control his fingers. Additionally, he can feel any pain that is inflicted on his detached pieces. Rivaling Luffy and Zoro, Buggy has a ridiculous amount of dumb luck, where no matter how terrible a situation becomes for him, he somehow manages to survive, gaining more than he lost. He manages to become allies with Alvida, who rescued him from a giant crab, then located his missing parts. At Impel Down, Buggy earned followers in the form of the dangerous criminals, whose bounties surpasses his own, having freed them all, because Luffy arrived there at the same time to save Ace. Since then, following a series of events that happened to have all coincided with Buggy's actions, the dangerous pirates continued viewing him as being more powerful than he was, which went alongside his own connections with the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and the Emperor, Shanks, to even \"rescuing\" Luffy and Jinbe from Sakazuki, because he was in the air lamenting his lost goals. Because of this, he earned his position of a Warlord, then sometime after losing this position, he became an Emperor, because of his \"supposed\" command over Dracule Mihawk and Crocodile, who happened to have saved him as the Marines came to arrest him, all because one of his men made it appear so in the poster sent out. While both Mihawk and Crocodile were initially wrathful at Buggy, for his unintentional usurpation of the Cross Guild's presidency, the two predominant pirates had eventually agreed to spare Buggy's life as they chose to have Buggy be the Cross Guild's figurehead so that the weak pirate can have all the excessive global attention. Buggy's most frequently used weapons are his knives. In addition to simply holding them, he has also put his knives between his fingers to wield them like claws. He often uses his knives in conjunction with his Devil Fruit power by flying his detached hands and trying to strike people from afar; he can also throw the knives with power and accuracy. Additionally, he possesses retractable knife blades in his shoes, and can detach his legs and spin them to strike opponents. Thus, Buggy is capable of overwhelming opponents by flying his detached blade-holding limbs at rapid speed and attacking from multiple directions at once. He wielded a sword when attempting to behead Luffy in Loguetown. Buggy's most prominent weapons are his Buggy Balls, which are immensely powerful cannonballs that can instantly demolish an entire row of buildings. With this ammunition, he can terrorize a village that is not well protected such as Orange Town and easily destroy it whenever he wants. Additionally, he has also fired Buggy Balls at people who come to his base to confront him or subordinates that displease him, bringing certain death upon them. However, his crewmates have shown to be able to survive after being hit. While in Impel Down, Buggy revealed a smaller version of the Buggy Ball known as the Muggy Ball. Despite being only slightly bigger than a bullet, the Muggy Ball possesses equivalent destructive power to a Buggy Ball, and since it is so small, Buggy can carry them on his body and throw them rather than having to shoot them out of a cannon like Buggy Balls. Buggy was able to severely injure the awakened Zoan user Minotaurus by hitting him with a Muggy Ball. Muggy balls do not make Buggy balls entirely redundant, however, as they aren't able to be fired out of a cannon, so they can only be launched a fraction of the speed Buggy balls can, and are much slower."},
{"name": "Caesar Clown", "episode": "Episode 658", "chapter": "Chapter 581", "year": 2012, "note": "His name was revealed in Chapter 663.", "appearance": "Caesar has a very gaseous look due to his Devil Fruit ability. He has very long, spiky, black hair, brown eyes (yellow in the anime), and two curly horns growing from the back of his head. He is rather tall (shown to be about the same height as Brook when standing next to him with his gas powers deactivated), and wears purple lipstick and dark makeup on his eyes. He has a small flat nose and long thin eyebrows. His arms are very thin in comparison with the rest of his body. Caesar wears a big light blue colored coat with \"GAS\" printed in pink on each side (in his first appearances this was not present). Under his coat, he wears a pair of diagonally-striped yellow overalls which are striped cross with orange lines. The overall is cut off right under his knees, exposing his hairy legs. He also wears dark purple gloves with the initials \"CC\" in white on them. Due to his constant gaseous form, he seems to not use shoes, remaining barefoot, though only when his powers were disabled, his feet solidified with the rest of his body along with a simple pair of shoes. Four years before his debut, Caesar had shorter hair that was more rounded, and wore a polka dot patterned shirt beneath his coat. Over two decades ago Caesar had bowl cut hair style. During his third fight with Luffy, Luffy greatly damaged Caesar's face, which knocked some of his teeth out and bent his facial structure inwards, and seemingly breaking his nose. As a result, his pronunciation became a bit hard to understand. After absorbing the Shinokuni, Caesar's entire body structure changed to a darker gas color matching that of the gas, becoming as comparably large as a giant, with his hair growing completely wild and overly long. He also grows a coral-shaped crown behind his horns. The word in kanji \"Land of Death\" (?) is written on the front of his chest. Upon his defeat, he returns to normal. When under the service of Capone Bege, he disguised himself by wearing a blue shirt with an aqua scarf and suspenders while donning a spiky hairstyle that covered his horns. While part of the Sanji Retrieval Team-Fire Tank Pirates Alliance, he wore a yellow suit. In the anime, Caesar's skin tone is shown to be a pale white, while in the manga it is shown as a more natural tone.", "personality": "A cruel, arrogant, scheming, sinister, and an overall very evil person, Caesar takes great delight in causing harm and destruction to anything and anybody around him. His psychopathic nature is displayed many times, such as when he set off a chemical weapon on Punk Hazard, killing or crippling most of its inhabitants and destroying its environment, selling or creating weapons of mass destruction for similarly unscrupulous individuals such as Doflamingo, performing sick experiments on children and drugging them with a lethal, addictive drug to ensure that they do not run away, and trying to murder everyone on Punk Hazard (Trafalgar Law, the Straw Hats, Smoker's Marines, the children, and his own blindly following minions) so he could test out his new poisonous gas weapon-pet, Smileyall of which he does without a shred of remorse or empathy for his potential victims. He also demonstrates tendencies of egomania when Luffy mentioned his Gasu Gasu no Mi had no effect on his immune system due to Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi, both being poisonous Devil Fruits of differentiating class, causing Caesar to become rapidly aggravated from the fact that Luffy compared his Logia powers to that of a \"mere\" Paramecia user. He was very surprised that his poisons did not affect Luffy due to the latter's immunity to poison given to him from his near-death poisoning by Magellan.Caesar takes utmost pride in the biological weapons he created. Proudof the unexpected power of his Koro gas weapon, he was rather unhappy when the Straw Hat Pirates forced him to counter it to save the poisoned Mink Tribe.He was extremely excited when the Fire Tank Pirates used his KX Launchers in their attempt to assassinate Big Mom and was frustrated when the Emperor easily destroyed his weapons simply by screaming. He has shown to have maniacal tendencies due to his sedulous research on weapons of mass destruction and his absence of emotion at the time of murdering people or provoking any type of suffering such as giving drugs to the children so they would suffer severe withdrawal and return to his research facility for more \"candies\" filled with the stimulant, and showing no regret or sorrow for his actions. He is also very sadistic, as he exploited the blind trust of his wounded subordinates to test a newly developed gas and ordered the Yeti Cool Brothers to assassinate Brownbeard when he thought he was no use to him anymore: he further provoked a partially-paralyzed Brownbeard by revealing the truth about the gas explosion four years ago, in order to create an opportunity to have his subordinates shoot him down. He also used the restricted drug NHC10 to maintain his control of the children he kidnapped, knowing that they will be unable to escape due to the agonizing withdrawal symptoms, and that by his own calculations, they will die in five years after he started his experiments with them, which he deems a necessary sacrifice for his science. Law found this aspect of Caesar disgusting. Caesar also seems to enjoy cocktails, as he is often seen holding a cocktail glass. He appears to have a grudge against Vegapunk, as well as a cautious disposition, as shown when he hid from the Marines instead of trying to engage them immediately, as well as trusting Monet's deduction that the Straw Hats might be more powerful than their bounties claim, and waiting for Joker's approval to make his actions look like accidents, before starting attacks. Caesar is also a rather economizing person, as he did not want to waste the poison by clearing it off, but rather, collected, saved and compressed it into Smiley. He also appears to be able to act or lie on several occasions, often being seen feigning emotions when lying to his subordinates and to the children, a trait that was quickly noted by Monet when he attempted to show false concern for his subordinates facing Smiley. However, with the blind trust of his subordinates and some crocodile tears, he was able to deceive them easily, leading them to believe that Vegapunk was responsible for the Punk Hazard explosion four years ago. Caesar also is very ill-tempered and quick to anger when things do not go his way, such as yelling at his subordinates to let the gas come in to kill the intruders and his own men and again when Monet pointed out that Vergo would die and Caesar just yelled, unconcerned about his potential disloyalty. Upon losing the upper hand against Luffy during their last fight, Caesar lost his composure and ordered his subordinates to let in the Shinokuni gas, while outwardly exclaiming that they can easily be replaced. He then goes as far as personally killing the ones present simply to test out his newly acquired power, revealing his true colors in the process. He is a very prideful person, going as far to say that his work four years ago on the weapon that caused the Punk Hazard incident was not a failure, but instead was a great success, implying a superiority complex. Due to his pride in his own work, he tends to blush when his work is praised, even by the enemy, but turned to indignity when that praise turned towards Vegapunk. He was also shocked to see Smiley not listening to him and eat the candy despite Caesar saying to wait and Caesar said it was alright while Monet noted he was not listening to him. Despite his pride, Caesar is capable of knowing when a task is beyond his capabilities, as when Big Mom commissioned him to turn her family into giants, Caesar knew that the task was impossible despite his own view of himself. He also does not take kindly to insults, as when Law called him stupid, Caesar lashes out by punching Law's heart. Similarly, when Bege called him an idiot, Caesar angrily corrected Bege by saying he is a genius. Unlike most Logia users, Caesar keeps his Devil Fruit ability activated all the time and is either completely or partly turned into gas. Caesar has an odd habit of being easily shocked by things that leave him dumbfounded, often doing a comical face-fault, such as when Luffy survived his second Gastanet attack and appeared behind him unharmed. He did so again when Luffy was about to attack him from behind in their second fight together, which seems to be a running gag on his part. Upon Luffy declaring that he does not want to see Caesar's face anymore out of anger, the scientist cried in fear right before he was sent flying by Luffy's Gear 3 attack. Caesar is also very cowardly when his life is threatened in any way. When he was about to lose to Luffy he attempted to beg the Straw Hat captain to spare him and even make him his subordinate. He also repeatedly begged Doflamingo to save him and even later begged the Straw Hats to protect him from Big Mom on more than one occasion. While Caesar does at least attempt to fulfill commissions made by other people, he is not averse to giving up on them and will abuse his money and privileges on a hedonistic lifestyle of women and alcohol instead, especially if the projects given to him are proven to be too difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish (i.e. gigantification). He would even continue to lie to his investor in order to embezzle more money for such purposes. When he was under Doflamingo's protection, Caesar did not care about what he did to other people because he viewed himself as safe from them, even from that of an Emperor. Upon losing Doflamingo to the Marines, however, Caesar came to fear the consequences, especially since one of his clienteles is none other than Charlotte Linlin, one of the Four Emperors, and he became desperate with lies and thoughts of escaping, even admitting (to himself) that the given project was outright beyond his own limits (which he normally was so arrogant about). However, Caesar's prideful and arrogant attitude can at the very least be scratched, as he started crying in anger when Nami and Chopper referred to him as \"human scum\" and \"the worst\" during the operation to ruin Big Mom's Tea Party. He has a distinct laugh of \"Shurororororo\" (Shuhohoho in Viz media translation).", "abilities_and_powers": "Caesar has authority over all the former test subjects on the island as he saved them from the gas, and he uses their blind-trust to manipulate them. However, after Caesar revealed that he does not care about his subordinates, he lost their faith. Caesar is also shown to be highly crafty and cunning, easily facilitating an escape from a Marine battleship escort after he was arrested and then returning to Punk Hazard, as well as ensuring that his affiliate Trafalgar Law would not renege on their partnership by having him use his own \"Ope Ope no Mi\" to remove his heart and place it in Caesar's safekeeping in exchange for allowing him to stay on Punk Hazard (while also demonstrating an act of goodwill by allowing Law to take the heart of Caesar's secretary Monet himself). This reveals the level of caution Caesar has around other individuals of comparable or greater power than himself. He is also very aware of the consequences of murdering Vice-Admiral Smoker and his G-5 Marines on site. He also was able to escape when he was captured and kept himself hidden for a long while. He also purposely enraged a partially paralyzed Brownbeard in order to prevent the subordinates present from suspecting him, and have them shoot down Brownbeard without being the wiser. Despite Caesar's cowardly behavior, he has a strong will being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki. In direct combat, Caesar has also proven to be a fairly powerful fighter, using his Devil Fruit abilities to quickly maneuver out of dangerous situations and being durable enough to take several Haki-imbued Gear 2 strikes from Luffy, only to emerge relatively unharmed. His durability extends to being seemingly unfazed by either the boiling hot or the sub-zero temperatures which compose the \"Burning Lands\" and the \"Ice Lands\" zones on Punk Hazard respectively. He withstood a blow from Luffy that left a big dent in his face and still retained consciousness. He is also very stealthy, being able to administer a muscle relaxant to Brownbeard without the latter noticing. Caesar is also physically strong, able to easily carry around a large and tall mirror which the Straw Hats and the Fire Tank Pirates would use to escape. Caesar also assured his confidence in carrying Brle, who is a very tall woman while bringing along the mirror. Caesar is a skilled scientist and chemist who particularly specializesin creating dangerous biological and chemical weapons that the Marine's Science Division, including Vegapunk, greatly feared. One of his experimental weapons had rendered Punk Hazard a barren wasteland. Derived from his scientific expertise, he invented massively destructive weapons, the most prominent one being a pet slime named Smiley, a mountain-sized toxic blob monster that constantly emits some kind of smoke or vapor and has been \"fed\" the Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl (which gave the once inanimate blob life and form), which Caesar would unleash when trespassers become too much of a threat. He can control Smiley by using verbal commands, demonstrated when he ordered the Smilies to attach themselves to Luffy, and they obeyed. Caesar is also the only person who knows how to produce a substance called SAD, a rare and valuable substance that is an essential ingredient for the creation of Artificial Zoan Devil Fruits called SMILEs. Because of this, Doflamingo values Caesar's work greatly, as he apparently employs the scientist's expertise to cater the military expansion demands of one of the Four Emperors. However, his SMILEArtificial Devil Fruits areextremely unstable as they only have a ten percent chance of success in granting Zoan Devil Fruit enhancements while most people who consume the SMILE will not receive a power, and on top of losing the ability to swim, they become unable to express negative emotions and they are forced to smile and laugh all of the time. Additionally he helped Chopper develop an enhanced Rumble Ball that extends Chopper's Monster Point by thirty minutes, albeit with the added side effect of causing Chopper to temporarily take on a weakened shrunken version of Brain Point after Monster Point expires. He was even able to turn normal humans into giants, a feat that even Vegapunk could not accomplish, though Caesar has resorted to illegal and inhumane methods that Vegapunk considers unacceptable (by kidnapping children to use as test subjects to take advantage of their natural growth factor and forcing vast amounts of dangerous drugs down their systems), and the fact that the children used would expire within five years from the continuous experiments, which led the Marines to refuse to acknowledge him to be superior to the head scientist. He also uses the highly restricted drug NHC10, though his authorization on its usage is illegal, as he is a criminal, and he used it as for its addictive means instead of medicinal purposes. He is also in the possession of another unnamed drug that relaxes the recipient's muscles, making it impossible, or at least extremely difficult, for the person to talk or stand. All this earned him recognition as the world's leading expert on mass murdering weapons for biological warfare. His expertise in creating and designing weapons for biological warfare is so great that Capone Bege recruited him in his plot to assassinate Big Mom. Caesar was able to create the KX Launcher, a weapon with poison strong enough that could potentially kill an Emperor, and managed to prepare three for the Fire Tank Pirates to use within a fairly short period of time. Caesar ate the Gasu Gasu no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that grants him the ability to create, control, and transform his body into various chemical gases. He can create gases that are extremely poisonous and/or highly combustible. He can also remove oxygen in a certain area around himself to nullify fire-based attacks or asphyxiate his opponents. Caesar has performed numerous experiments with his power and he seems to prefer keeping his Devil Fruit ability active, as he is always either completely or partly gaseous. Caesar can absorb other gases, causing him to greatly grow in size, as well as take on the properties of said gas. For example, when he absorbed a cloud of Shinokuni, he gained its petrification properties, allowing him to petrify anyone he touches. When he is in his gaseous form, he is able to fly and enter places that no normal solid being can. He was seen demonstrating this ability when hiding inside some beakers when he was informed that the Marines were nearby. Even in his intangible gaseous form, he can become dense enough to hold objects, like his cocktail glass. It is unknown if this is because he can control the density of his gaseous form. He can generate a destructive gas beam that can incinerate metal and even the fearsome Fighting Fish while on the way to Green Bit. He was seen using a dual-barreled flintlock to threaten Law when he learned of his past associations with Luffy. He was also shown using various weapons in conjunction with his Devil Fruit abilities; like explosive red and blue castanets filled with volatile gas called \"Gastanets\" which he claps together to create a massive explosion, using matches to ignite a gas he calls \"Miok Gas\" to cause an explosion in the immediate area, and a sword hilt, bearing some similarity to a Bunsen burner, that he concentrates oxygen in to use a technique called \"Blue Sword\". He also used a syringe to inject a muscle relaxant into Brownbeard stealthily to prevent his subordinates' trust from being compromised. In One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3, he throws out large pieces of candy that cause random status effects on enemies during one of his combos."},

As a demonstration of his strength, he fought on a par with Dorry for a hundred years and together with the latter he managed to defeat such great creatures that not even the other giants of their crew would have been able to capture. The strength of the two giants is in fact such that Galdino, a member of Baroque Works who is capable of defeating a pirate with a bounty of 42,000,000, said he could in no way defeat them without resorting to deception, even with the help from Miss Golden Week, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine Brogy is also capable of easily killing the dinosaurs of Little Garden, prey he hunts daily, even remaining virtually impassive to their bite. Together with Dorry he also managed to pierce the Island Eater, despite the great distance that separated them. Even Luffy, after seeing them perform this feat, stated that the two were monstrously powerful. Brogy's strength is also such as to allow him to free himself from Galdino's wax, despite being as hard as steel. In combat, Brogy used a shield and a battle axe. His previous axe was called the Bruiser Axe, but after a hundred years of battle, the blade lost its sharpness and eventually broke. Brogy later replaced it with a new axe.

{"name": "Buffalo", "episode": "Episode 692", "chapter": "Chapter 618", "year": 2012, "note": "He was first mentioned by Donquixote Doflamingo in Chapter 682.", "appearance": "Buffalo is an extremely large man with disproportionate, thin limbs. His dark hair is arranged in a propeller-like formation; the hair on top of his head extending straight up, a pair of sideburns extended outward to the sides, and a long goatee, and though his hairdo may seem deliberately styled this way, the hairs which stick out are actually cowlicks. Initially, he was seen with several cowlicks in the shape of a turbine formation, but was later seen with just four in the shape of a more traditional propeller. He has protruding teeth where his crew's Jolly Roger is depicted. He wears a yellow fur coat and wraps thick chains around his body, and is seen wearing a pair of strange-shaped boots. At 14 years old, Buffalo already possessed a large physique for his age and slight buckteeth. His hair was arranged into two antennae and he wore a beanie. At age 20, Buffalo's buckteeth did not yet carry the crew's symbol, and his hair was organized in more of a clover-petals formation, similar to the shape of a ship propeller. His clothes were darker in color than his current attire.", "personality": "Buffalo is very loyal to his \"family\", being perfectly fine with that fact that Donquixote Doflamingo destroyed eight cities and all the people living there, simply for the sake of keeping Baby 5 away from her \"boyfriends\". Buffalo also protested against Law's betrayal, assuring that Doflamingo had reserved the \"Corazon throne\" for him. He follows the crew's blood law very seriously, as when seeing Trafalgar Law stabbing Corazon, Buffalo immediately decided to tell Doflamingo about it; he flew into a rage when Kyros decapitated a string clone of Doflamingo, believing that gladiator has killed the real \"young master\". During his childhood, Buffalo was something of a prankster, playing tricks on the ever-clumsy Corazon and getting a chuckle at the officer's expense, despite being struck across the face in return. He also once laughed at Pica's voice, which resulted in torture as punishment. However, typical for a sweet-loving child, he was easily bribed when Law gave him some ice cream in exchange for his silence about stabbing Corazon. He seems to be a compulsive gambler, and enjoys gambling as he asked Baby 5 for a loan of 2,000,000, despite just teasing asking her how high in debt she is, so he can take it to the casino after their mission. He apparently does not approve of cheaters, as a group of scammers swindling a blind man in Acacia were noted to only have been doing so because of Buffalo's absence. Despite his aloof and greedy personality, he also seems to be very enthusiastic, as he is almost always seen smiling. He also has a habit of saying \"nnnniin\" during his sentences, to imitate the sound of a propeller.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Buffalo held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He appears to be a competent fighter as Doflamingo sent him, along with Baby 5, to Punk Hazard, despite knowing what the Straw Hats were up to. He has been partnered with Baby 5, and the two of them use their abilities in conjuncture with each other to make powerful combinations. The two were already capable members of the crew in their childhoods, whereas as much as 100 recruits had left after two days, tops, from inability to keep up with the training regimen. Despite this Kyros easily defeated him even with only one leg. Buffalo has been shown to possess incredible endurance, as he was able to take several powerful attacks such as Franky Shogun's General Cannon and Nami's Thunder Breed Tempo before finally being knocked unconscious by Usopp's Totsugeki Ryuseigun. Buffalo ate the Guru Guru no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to make any part of his body spin around like a propeller. He can also create centripetal force by spinning his own body parts and use it to strengthen the force of his attacks, such as by using it in conjunction with Baby 5's weaponized body to increase the damage she can inflict. His spinning body parts can also be used to create powerful gusts of wind. He can also use this power fly through the air, even over long distances across the sea and skies. Thanks to his large body, he can serve as a means of transportation for a normal sized human by allowing them to ride on his back, as seen when he and Baby 5 were flying over the coast of Punk Hazard. Buffalo uses his own rotational abilities in conjunction with Baby 5's ability to transform into a full-body blade to create a powerful spinning cut that can cut through incoming projectiles or pierce through heavy armor."},
{"name": "Brook", "episode": "Episode 442", "chapter": "Chapter 337", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Before his death, Brook was a tall, tan, skinny man who had a rather distinctive face. He had a slight goatee on his chin and some side burns. He typically wore shades never revealing his eyes. On his forehead was a scar that slightly resembles a diagonal omega sign (). This scar was retained in his skeletal state as a distinctive crack across his skull. Brook's facial appearance, accompanied with his style of clothing, resembles a type of appearance and style that is commonly associated with various music artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendrix, Slash, and other musical celebrities with similar features. Brook is an extremely tall skeleton dressed in formal attire complete with top hat and cane. Standing at 266cm (8'8\") in height, he is the second tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, having been edged out by Jinbe. Despite having no skin, he still has an afro which he says is because his hair has very strong roots. Brook's style was that of a gentleman consisting of a coat, top hat, trousers and afro, which were black, while the inner linings of his coat were yellow-orange. The cravat that was tied in between his coat and around his neck was blue. The outer covering of Brook's cane sword which he carries was purple. Also, due to his many years of seclusion his clothes were somewhat tattered. During the Return to Sabaody Arc through Fish-Man Island Arc, he changed to more colorful and high-end clothes, as though to represent a rock star. He had heart-shaped sunglasses, a yellow feather boa, a new top hat with a giant crown on the brim and orange red trousers with a floral design. Despite being a skeleton, he grew to 277 cm (9'1\") during the two-year timeskip. During the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a flashy striped coat, after taking it from a member of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit. During the Dressrosa Arc, he wore a dark magenta long-coat with an upturned collar in addition to yellow pants. While shown on Zou during this arc, his second outfit consisted of a pink shirt with a white polka dot pattern (which resemble the circles on the SMILE fruits), orange and yellow striped trousers, and pointed dark colored shoes. He also donned his original pre-timeskip top hat, a blue bead necklace, and he swapped his heart shaped sunglasses for a more traditional black pair. During the Zou Arc, he added a dark colored coat with a fluffy lining to his second Dressrosa outfit along with a larger top hat embellished with beads. Due to being chased and chewed on by his canine Mink admirers, his coat had become somewhat tattered by the time he met up with Luffy's group. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, he wore a long, fancy overcoat with puffy sleeves and tall black boots. He also wrapped a decorative scarf around his head and donned a pair of plain black shades. Later on, after the Big Mom pirates stripped him of his clothes, he wore a simple sleeveless cloak with a rope tied around the neck to fasten it. When meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates, he dons a large fedora, a black and red striped vest along with dark shirt, yellow ascot, and brown trousers. When he took part in the operation to ruin Big Mom's Tea Party, Brook disguised himself among the Luffy clones created by Charlotte Brle's powers by wearing an oversized Luffy mask and hat tied with a string, which got him close enough to destroy Carmel's photo. During the Wano Country Arc, Kin'emon used his ability to change Brook's appearance so he could blend in with the country. Brook now wears a pure white kimono, with triangle-shaped headband and two arrows stuck in his body - an appearance befitting of a ghost, as Kurozumi Orochi's Oniwabanshu members mistake him as a gasha-dokuro. Before the raid on Onigashima, Brook wore a samurai armor complete with a kabuto helmet and cape. He also wields a katana rather than his shikomizue. When departing for Onigashima, Brook traded his samurai armor with a black vest and cravat and also a top hat. Like everyone else participating in the raid, Kin'emon gave Brook a Beasts Pirates disguise with a dark-colored furred coat and one-horned hat. During the Egghead Arc, after reaching the control tower, Brook changes into a thick long coat with the number 3 on it, along with a futuristic helmet with goggles, an antenna, and a chinstrap on it.

{"name": "Borsalino", "episode": "Episode 504", "chapter": "Chapter 398", "year": 2008, "note": "He was first mentioned by Nico Robin in Chapter 319. His real name was revealed in Chapter 507. More commonly known by his alias Kizaru.", "appearance": "Kizaru is an incredibly tall, relatively slim man, roughly the same size as the other two ex-admirals Aokiji and Akainu. He is of middle age with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face, short curly black hair, and a very thin beard. He is older than the other two admirals, a fact that is reflected in his looks. Kizaru's standard outfit consists of a yellow striped suit with a Marine coat draped over his shoulders like a cape, with his arms not in its sleeves. Kizaru also wears pure white shoes, gold-amber tinted sunglasses, and a dark green shirt with a mauve tie under his yellow suit. There is a tiny Black Den Den Mushi on his left wrist, like a wristwatch, underneath the sleeve of his suit. He is generally seen wearing a relaxed grin on his face. As a child, he wore a large yellow striped hat, much like his older self's suit, a yellow vest and he still had his grin that he maintained throughout his life. In his early days as a Marine, he wore a knit cap with the Marine emblem on it, sunglasses, and also a normal Marine jacket with a striped undershirt. In his youth, he wore a Marine skull cap and had no facial hair. Twenty-seven years before the start of the series, he wore a typical Marine cap, and his beard was not as full as it is currently. He also lacked the gold amber-tinted sunglasses, shirt, and tie, which he was last seen wearing. When he was seen stationed at Marineford as a vice admiral thirteen years before the start of the series, he was sporting a large dark grey hat, dark gloves and had a cigarette in his mouth. His trademark pinstriped suit was light grey, matching his tie, while his thin beard was not yet present. For a time, his appearance after the timeskip in the anime deviated from that in the manga, as his character reappeared in the anime before being reintroduced in the manga, where he was given a different design than what Eiichiro Oda eventually decided to use for the manga. In One Piece Film: Z, he was shown wearing a different pinstripe suit, and instead of a collared shirt and tie, had on a viridian green turtleneck. The appearance he had here was also seen on his half-completed wax likeness made by Diego in Episode of Luffy and used for One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2 and One Piece: Unlimited World Red. This served as his acting post-timeskip appearance, until he made his first actual appearance after the timeskip in the manga in Chapter 802, which saw him in a pinstripe suit similar to the one shown for his anime appearances, but not entirely sharing the same design, nor was it the one he had worn before the timeskip. He also continued wearing a collared shirt and tie instead of a turtleneck.", "personality": "Kizaru comes off as perpetually calm, equable, easygoing, and taking most things lightly no matter the severity of the situation. He talks in a calm voice suiting this demeanor: in a slow, sarcastically intonated manner with the last syllable of a sentence often drawn out  usually the sentence-final particles \"ne\" (?) or \"yo\" (?) for emphatic effect. He is prone to beginning sentences with a stressed \"ooh\", such as when observing something surprising or that piques his interest. Still, despite such laxity, Kizaru's register is quite formal (compared to Aokiji's more colloquial or Akainu's rougher, more derogatory speech patterns), using the polite \"desu/masu\" and taking care to address certain people with an honorific (such as his superior or even a pirate of high status); his first-person pronoun is \"wasshi\" (?), indicating his older age. With an ever-relaxed air in or out of combat, Kizaru is almost never shown losing his cool, raising his voice, or getting excited to prompt action. With his Logia intangibility, he can afford remaining apathetic to most enemy attempts to harm him, paying extremely sudden or surprisingly potent attacks little to no mind if they come from much weaker opposition, to the point of not visibly reacting at all when shot in the head. This attitude of the admiral often lapses into absentmindedness, if not outright carelessness, that has him do things like repeatedly speak into a black Den Den Mushi meant not for talk but wiretapping (which had been explained to him multiple times) or politely ask fleeing pirates who had just shot at him if they might help him find his acquaintance. Kizaru has also been shown irresponsibly using his abilities with no regard for collateral damage, acting oblivious to the mass destruction that he threatens to bring on; this is seen when he caused a Yarukiman Mangrove on Sabaody to fall on self-admitted accident, then simply brushed it off. Additionally, Kizaru's casual attitude about whatever occurs around him may give way to the man leaving himself open to unsuspecting assault, such as watching his opponents unleash attacks without readying himself. Kizaru has been seen mid-battle remarking that it is \"scary\" or \"shocking\" when encountering someone powerful, bold, or who unleashes a surprising ability; however, he typically retains a nonchalant face and tone, making him sound facetious. In fact, Kizaru has acted fearlessly around the strongest of pirates, like Silvers Rayleigh, Benn Beckman, Marco, or even Whitebeard, an Emperor. While acknowledging their strength, Kizaru has no issue with battling them one-on-one and, should they get in his way, will simply attempt to circumvent them. After Shanks came to Marineford to end the war, Kizaru tried one last attack on Monkey D. Luffy right after Beckman had held him at gunpoint just to prevent him from so doing. Two years later, the admiral volunteered to personally go break up a potential meeting between Emperors Big Mom and Kaidou, which would have entailed going to the independent Wano Country of which even Akainu was wary at the time. Later, Kizaru elected to lead a fleet of warships to Egghead to prevent Vegapunk from being rescued from the island by the Straw Hats, despite knowing that Luffy had become an Emperor after defeating Kaidou. In battle, Kizaru can be condescending towards those he deems weak, mocking them or those associated with them. During the Marineford War, he initially went out of his way to strike down Luffy, seeking to illustrate their gap in strength. He would go on to viciously reproach Luffy for his inadequacy and denigrated Whitebeard for rallying behind the weaker pirate. Despite his high rank, Kizaru is not much a leader and prefers to follow orders, even if they come from subordinates (provided that they are close to him). Carrying out justice at his own pace and in a noncommittal way, his motto is \"Unclear Justice\" (, Dotchitsukazu no Seigi?, VIZ: \"Uncertain Justice\"), seemingly representing the gray area between Moral and Absolute Justice to allow Kizaru to operate with greater freedom. By his own admission, the admiral considers himself like a \"cog in a machine\" who simply acts as ordered, allowing him to shuffle off personal responsibility and justify certain actions on his part (like eliminating a once-close colleague like Vegapunk) as just him following orders. Indeed, with no qualms about carrying out any orders given to him, Kizaru has acted more callous than the highly moral-bound Aokiji and Fujitora, yet does not go out of his way to achieve justice to as thorough an extent as extremists like Akainu and Ryokugyu. In general, Kizaru seems inclined towards missions that do not require significant work, as he went to deal with the issue on Sabaody due to expecting it to be over quickly and became annoyed when Rayleigh interfered. The admiral may shift objectives on a whimsical basis, as seen on Sabaody when he went from initially looking for Sentomaru (per the original goal of his mission, detaining the Straw Hats) to then committing to an unrelated fight with four Supernovas, yet after defeating them simply disregarded their capture upon being given a new instruction. Regardless, Kizaru acts disdainful toward pirates on a default basis and will not show them mercy; he saw the Seven Warlords of the Sea as no more than pirates and claimed that a man like Rayleigh, despite having retired from piracy over 20 years earlier, could never see his crimes forgiven as a someone formerly of the Roger Pirates. After failing to capture Luffy on Sabaody, Kizaru instead went ahead with capturing 500 other pirates, showing that he may sway between either a more thorough or a more remissive execution of justice. Yet, despite Kizaru's unconcern for most things to do with his profession, he does seem to harbor a degree of honor in battle, though it may be reserved for opponents whom he respects or can claim closeness to, as he showed no such inclinations towards pirates. When Saint Saturn suggested the admiral simply bypass Sentomaru on Egghead instead of engaging him, Kizaru said that he could not do so since, with his old friend dedicated to making his stand against him, he felt that he had to honor this resolution and fight him directly. Still, Kizaru took down Sentomaru without reservations.", "abilities_and_powers": "As an admiral, Kizaru ranks second only to Fleet Admiral Sakazuki (formerly Sengoku) in the Marines, holding power over the many thousands of junior personnel. His authority entails commanding fleets, having sway on the overall strategy of headquarters, and issuing special-purpose orders like a Buster Call to destroy any island he judges a threat, or temporarily passing on to others such privileges. The admiral being able to exercise these authorities duly and efficiently bespeaks a great deal of military leadership and coordination skills on his part. Even as a vice admiral twelve years ago, Kizaru was already a powerful combatant, enough to effortlessly defeat Arlong, one of the premier members of the Sun Pirates. Since his promotion to admiral, Kizaru has come to be crowned the World Government's \"Greatest Military Force\" alongside his two admiral peers, thus being recognized as one of the world's most powerful people. Kizaru's mere presence on the Sabaody Archipelago was enough to cause a mass panic, inducing its pirate population (including most of the Supernovas present at the time) to flee. While on the island, Kizaru was able to overwhelm four of said SupernovasBasil Hawkins, Urouge, X Drake, and Scratchmen Apoowith minimal effort, individually defeating each of them with single attacks after they had failed to do anything against him (sans Apoo with two invisible surprise attacks that, nonetheless, proved completely ineffectual at hurting the admiral). Thereafter, Kizaru entered into one-on-one sword combat with an old Silvers Rayleigh, the former \"Right Hand of the Pirate King\". Though Rayleigh held the admiral's entire focus by Kizaru's own admission, the elder pirate eventually grew tired while Kizaru did not thanks to his younger age compared to the enemy, and both men emerged from the fight in conjecturally fine condition (with Kizaru only suffering a small cut on his cheek). Kizaru would then go on, before leaving Sabaody, to capture a total of 500 pirates. The Summit War saw Kizaru fighting, if only briefly, several of Whitebeard's division commanders on equal footing, including the Emperor's \"right hand\" Marco, and later against Whitebeard himself, whom he was able to seriously injure; Whitebeard and Marco were the only pirates to prompt the admiral to fight somewhat seriously. Also, despite his more or less constant involvement in the fighting that went on, Kizaru was ultimately one of few people to emerge from the war wholly unscathed, with not a mark to show for it. Following the two-year timeskip, ahead of the Marines' siege of Egghead, Kizaru was chosen to serve as personal protection for one of the Five Elders, having enough trust placed in him to escort said Elder to Egghead and potentially protect him from an Emperor of the Sea, Monkey D. Luffy. Upon personally arriving on the island, Kizaru's presence was immediately sensed by Luffy, who seemed visibly unnerved by the powerful foe he detected. In short order, the admiral went on to defeat Sentomaru, a Haki master who is Vegapunk's strongest bodyguard, dealing the finishing blow with a single laser attack. As with all admirals, Kizaru's physical abilities are immense. His raw strength was enough for him to trade equal blows with the elder (yet still extremely powerful) Rayleigh and effectively engage Whitebeard, the \"Strongest man in the world\" who, even in his old age, retained bodily might well above a giant's; Kizaru even held down Whitebeard's large naginata with just one foot, with seemingly little effort. Generally, Kizaru's melee attack style empathizes incredibly heavy kicks via his ability to move at the speed of light, allowing Kizaru to easily demolish entire buildings and incapacitate pirates worth over 100,000,000 with singular blows. Kizaru is also immensely durable. He shrugged off being blown out of the sky by a Haki-enforced kick from Marco (which broke his one-armed guard and sent him crashing into the ground with immense force) without sustaining a scratch, though his transforming into light prior to impact may have allowed for this. The admiral has compared his bodily defense to that of Sentomaru, a world-class guard whom Kizaru once taught his skills, and he easily withstood being struck in the head by Sentomaru's Haki-powered Ashigara Dokkoi attack without being fazed. Later, Kizaru casually blocked a powerful Haki kick from the Emperor Luffy with just his forearm. While Kizaru's natural speed is difficult to gauge considering his ability to move as light, the admiral's coordination of his lightspeed movementsfrom his kicks to traveling from place to placewith nonchalance yet unerring precision suggests that he does possess a high level of natural perception and reflex speed. Otherwise, Kizaru has shown impressive dexterity, able to balance himself on a launched, flying cannonball well enough to casually stand on it, as well as a rather acute sense of hearing, able to notice underwater activity from hundreds of meters away. Kizaru appears to be extremely skilled at swordsmanship, as he could fight Rayleigh, an extremely skilled swordsman in his own right, to a draw even while having his intangibility negated by his foe's powerful Haki. Additionally, Kizaru is impressive at marksmanship and aiming his laser beams with precision, allowing him destroy a small object held in someone's hand with a beam despite the great distance between them. Kizaru ate the Pika Pika no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into light. Among other things, he is able to move, travel, and perform kicks at the speed of light, shoot laser beams, and blind his opponents. For offense, Kizaru can shoot powerful laser beams from his fingertips and the bottoms of his feet, which can easily pierce through flesh and/or set off massive, heat-based explosions. He can fire a single laser with pinpoint accuracy or unleash a massive gatling of laser bullets over a wide area. By turning his body into light, Kizaru can move at lightspeed, allowing him to maneuver around the battlefield without his enemies being able to keep up unless they have sufficiently well-developed Kenbunshoku Haki. He can make his light body shift in place, allowing him to instantly reposition himself at a different location on the battlefield, and can also send out a beam of light that he can merge with and travel on to reach an intended location. Said light beam can only follow a straight line, though it can be reflected off of surfaces in a mirror-like fashion, allowing the beam (and thus Kizaru) to travel in zigzag. By accelerating to lightspeed, Kizaru can massively enhance his melee attacks. By moving his leg at the speed of light, the admiral's kicks are given massive weight and momentum, greatly increasing their force and allowing Kizaru to deal tremendous damage to opponents with individual blows. Additionally, Kizaru can stun and blind his opponents by emitting super-bright flashes of light, as well as, for close-quarters combat, \"solidify\" light into the shape of a massive sword to wield by hand against an enemy swordsman. As a marine admiral, Kizaru is a highly skilled Haki user. During the Summit War, Kizaru was seen using advanced-grade Busoshoku Haki to negate a long-distance quake shockwave sent out by Whitebeard, by generating, alongside his fellow admirals, an emitted shield combination of their three Haki to disperse said shockwave. Kizaru possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. Through his Devil Fruit, Kizaru can also create a sword made of light."},

He wears and a broad-rimmed fedora, a dred tie, and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up.", "personality": "Bobby Funk appears to have a sense of honor and pride as he was seen scolding Dagama for scheming with and bribing the other competitors, although Dagama implied that they might have also bribed their way into the same block as well. He has also shown love for his country. Bobby maintains a level head in combat, but does not appear to fight and when confronted by a warrior turned his back and pleaded, stating he has never fought in his life. His main interest appears to be restraining his older brother, although he has an absent-minded habit of restraining the person Kelly is fighting instead.", "abilities_and_powers": "He is a skilled assassin, so it can be assumed that he has some skill in fighting and assassination. He is allegedly strong enough to take down pirates worth over 100 million. According to his brother Kelly, Bobby was blessed with an extremely strong body from birth (strong enough that being struck by a Busoshoku Haki-infused axe not only did not hurt him, but also broke the axe), but his weak will and lack of fighting spirit prevents him from using it effectively. Thus, he usually wears his brother Kelly, allowing his bloodthirsty brother to make better use of his body."},
{"name": "Bobbin", "episode": "Episode 651", "chapter": "Chapter 571", "year": 2012, "note": "", "appearance": "Bobbin is a rather short yet broad individual with a wide grin and thick, red lips who wears a white mask covering a portion of his face. He has rather strange body proportions, as his shoulders appears to be higher than his chin and his arms are twice the length of his legs. His mask also features dark glasses, which obscure his eyes. He carries a sword larger than himself which is slung over his back and a black hat with a big white tuft sticking out of it. He also sports purple and black pinstriped pants with a large brown belt holding them up, a pink shirt, brown gloves, dark boots, and a long light blue cape which is also bigger than Bobbin himself.", "personality": "Bobbin seems to be quite ruthless, as shown when he reported to Big Mom after burning down an entire country and seemed pleased with himself for doing so. Furthermore, he is very loyal to his captain and shows absolutely no concern for islands that cannot pay her tribute. He even asked Linlin if she also wanted to burn Fish-Man Island when he heard that they could not deliver her any candy for quite a while. He also seems to be very confident in his strength, choosing to pursue Sanji on his own without the aid of his crewmates. He also seems to be gluttonous and disrespectful of other people's property, as seen when he took a piece of meat from a basket that Sanji was carrying. Bobbin has a habit of bobbing his head side to side when talking. Bobbin also has a signature laugh, starting with \"Bo\", continuing with \"yoyo\", and ending with an \"n\" (\"Boyoyon\").", "abilities_and_powers": "Bobbin was sent to burn down an island that failed to make its monthly tribute, a task in which he succeeded alongside several comrades. He has a great reputation, as Germa Kingdom princes Vinsmoke Niji and Vinsmoke Yonji recognized him as a heavyweight within the Big Mom Pirates, which is notable considering the vast size and strength of the crew. Bobbin was able to help bring down Luffy (while in his Gear 2 form) during the Big Mom Pirates' attack on him and Nami. However, Bobbin can let his guard down easily, like when he took the meat out of Sanji's bento box, the cook was able to swiftly smash Bobbin into a wall with one kick, leaving Bobbin shocked and injured on the floor. This was seen again after Bobbin left the castle to chase Sanji. During the pursuit, he was ambushed and shot by Vito. Although it is worth mentioning that Bobbin was able to recover from Sanji's attack in a relatively short amount of time, indicating a sufficient level of endurance and durability on his part, Bobbin has an ability that allows him to emanate rays that put people to sleep by bobbing his head. He wields a sword that is about twice his size. It is unknown how skilled he is with it."},
{"name": "Boa Sandersonia", "episode": "Episode 516", "chapter": "Chapter 409", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Sandersonia is a large woman who resembles a snake, with a curvaceous figure and large breasts like her sisters. Her head is disproportionately large and wide to her body and her long tongue is forked, often sticking out of her mouth and has sea green eyes (amber in snake form). Like the rest of the Kuja, she dresses in very revealing clothing: a green bikini top with white irregular patterns, a white cape over it and green panties encircled by flaps at both sides of her hips. She wears brown boots and a green stocking on her left leg with a design which resembles the Kuja Pirates' Jolly Roger. She is usually seen accompanied by the large panther, Bacura, at her side instead of a snake like the other Kuja. Along with her sisters, her beauty is highly admired by the Amazon Lily islanders. In her younger days, Sandersonia was an average height teen who wore orange skirt and green top. Sandersonia wore a tan bra that seems to be bandaged of some sort, after her clothes were burned during the fight against Monkey D. Luffy. At Rusukaina, Sandersonias attire does not change, with the exception of her cape and the designs of her bikini, which take the form of snake scales. On her back, covered by her cape and her long green hair, is a mark of slavery branded on her by their previous Celestial Dragon masters. It resembles a hoof mark and is a sign that means that she is \"less than human\" since she was a slave. Her sisters share this mark as well on their backs.", "personality": "Sandersonia appears very fond of her sister Hancock, as noted by the fact she laughed at her sister's \"twisted\" personality. While she appears to be living on the lie that her sisters and herself defeated a Gorgon to gain their curse, at the same time, she has not actually told a lie herself, unlike Hancock who is constantly lying. Sandersonia is the most emotional of the 3 sisters and highly emotional about their horrible past, her crying had to be eased by her sister Marigold and drove her to collapse onto the floor. Due to her slave brand's shameful meaning, Sandersonia and her sisters made their fellow Kuja believe that on their backs were a set of eyes she and her sisters received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon. They told them that these eyes turned anyone who sees them into stone. If any of the Kuja found out the truth, Sandersonia and her sisters would be forced to leave the island. In battle, Sandersonia is a playful warrior who teases and torments her victims before she crushes them. However, she is prone to underestimating her opponents, as seen by Luffy using second gear and Hashoku Haki.", "abilities_and_powers": "Ruling beside her sisters, Sandersonia has power over Amazon Lily and the rest of the Kuja women. Being a part of her sister's pirate crew, she is one of the elite Kuja warriors. She can also control her hair and shape them into snakes for increased attack strength. She is shown to have a strong will, being able to resist Luffy's Haoshoku Haki. While she was a slave of the World Nobles, Sandersonia and her sisters were force-fed Devil Fruits as a form of sick entertainment. Sandersonia ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Anaconda, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transform into an anaconda. She can bind and strike at her opponents with her tail, and her long flexible body can easily bend out of the way of her opponents' attacks. She can also shape her hair into a number of snakes. The fangs of her hair snakes are strong as steel. Sandersonia can use Busoshoku Haki since she was able to physically harm Luffy despite him being rubber. Sandersonia is able to read an opponent's movements and avoid their attacks using Kenbunshoku Haki, having mastered it to a point she can seamlessly dodge attacks at high speed. However, it is useless if said opponent is drastically faster than she is, such as Luffy in Gear 2."},
{"name": "Boa Marigold", "episode": "Episode 516", "chapter": "Chapter 409", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "When she was 13, Marigold was quite small and slim like her older sister. Now she is a muscled, big, large woman, due to a similar training method used by sumo wrestlers to bulk themselves. She also is one of many of the Kuja inhabitants who has large breasts with revealing cleavage. Her hair is arranged in a way that it looks like the patterns on a cobra's hood and to some extent, a Valkyrie's helmet. Marigold wears a pink bikini with Kuja designs and gold tassels that trail down to her pink loin cloth and purple flaps. She also wears a headband and necklace that is made out of pink flowers. At Rusukaina, Marigolds cape changed and her clothes are now blue, similar to her older sisters own color change. The Kuja believe that on her back, covered by her cape and her long hair, is a set of eyes that she, like her sisters, received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon. It is now known that the symbol on the Boa sisters' backs is the \"Hoof of the Soaring Dragon\", an emblem burned upon the slaves of the World Noble. During her escape from slavery she wore rags and her hair was slightly longer.

During her time as a slave, Marigold and her sisters were force fed Devil Fruits by their Celestial Dragon owners as a form of sick entertainment. Marigold ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: King Cobra, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transform into a King Cobra. She can bind and strike at her opponent with her tail, and her snake form appears to be incredibly resilient, seeming to go completely unharmed after lightning herself on fire. Her King Cobra form allows her to spit globs of venom at her opponents; even if the venom misses, it evaporates into poison gas, hindering an opponents' combat capabilities. She can also shape her own hair into snakes to increase her attack capabilities. Marigold has been seen using Busoshoku Haki, having enough mastery in the technique that she can light herself on fire without any harm. She is able to do an advanced Busoshoku technique where she can emit her Haki to deflect attacks. While she can do this, she cannot block an opponent's attack if it is too strong or fast for her, like Luffy's Gear 2 attacks. Marigold possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki.

{"name": "Boa Hancock", "episode": "Episode 516", "chapter": "Chapter 409", "year": 2008, "note": "She was first mentioned by the Risky Brothers in Chapter 489.", "appearance": "Hancock is considered the most beautiful woman in the world. She has a well-proportioned figure compared to her abnormal and huge sisters. She is very tall and slender with long black hair that extends past her waist with locks of hair that frame her face down to her chin and shows off her high forehead, dark brown (dark blue in the anime) eyes with long, voluminous eyelashes and pale skin. She has a narrow waist and very large breasts, and with serpent earrings. Her attire changes frequently. When first introduced, she wore a revealing red V-neck blouse that showed much of her chest and a loose sarong that exposed her long, slender legs with the green symbol of the Kuja adorned on it, along with a white cape sporting epaulettes more commonly found on the jackets of high-ranking Marines, and red high heel pumps. She then wore a qipao with a hooded cloak which she used it to cover Luffy until they arrived at Impel Down and then took it off during the battle against Whitebeard. During the Summit War of Marineford, she wore a purple dress with Kuja designs on it and purple high heel pumps. Upon her return to Amazon Lily, she reverted to her original outfit (with the exception of her cape). In all her outfits, she has worn a pair of golden earrings that resemble snakes and black high-heeled shoes; her attire is also adorned with the emblem of the Kuja, with the exception of when Hancock fell ill due to her Love Sickness, during which she wore a red blouse. After the timeskip, her attire looks the same as when she was first introduced, except it is colored blue (although it remains red in the anime). Her extraordinary beauty is noted by many throughout the world: one of the Risky Brothers claims that her beauty is in second place to the mermaids, especially Shirahoshi, while others like Marguerite and Hannyabal claim she is the most beautiful woman in the world. She is also almost always seen with Salome, her large Snake Weapon, which is usually seen smiling despite wearing a skull. Even though Hancock normally looks either calmly beautiful or cute (in an attempt to \"apologize\" for her actions), she can look very intimidating and angered with her eyes bulging madly and her teeth bared, as seen when Smoker attacked Luffy at Marineford. Before Hancock fell in love with Luffy and when she is not around Luffy, her eyes tend to look emotionless, but when she is around Luffy, her eyes show much more emotion, making her look like a girl in love. Along with her sisters, on her back is the slave mark of the Celestial Dragon, something that she was so intent on keeping secret and was willing to petrify anyone (other than her sisters and Elder Nyon) who saw it. In order to make sure it was never seen, she and her sisters concocted a lie that what was really on the sisters' backs were pairs of Gorgon eyes which would petrify anyone who sets eyes on them. Hancock uses this \"curse\" as an excuse for her and her sisters' Devil Fruit abilities. As a young child, she looked quite similar to how she does now, but the only difference is that only her side-locks went past her shoulders and were worn in beads. During her escape from Mary Geoise, she wore rags and her hair was tied in pigtails. In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Hancock is shown wearing a small, laced top with exotic swirl patterns leaving her mid-riff exposed. Her only other piece of clothing is a small loin cloth around her hips. In the 3D2Y special, she wears a purple dress with gold trim as well as black heels, and a great light purple image of her Jolly Roger at the bottom. During the Cidre Guild Arc and One Piece: Stampede, she wears a V-neck black dress with one of the sleeves and a half chest area in white and with images of her Jolly Roger on the part of the skirt, in addition to a purple sash at the waist, and a black cape with a pink interior and with golden shoulder pads, along with black heels. The author has also replied to a fan's question asking about Hancock's body measurements are as follows:", "personality": "Hancock is a very complex woman. At first glance, she appears to be selfish, pompous, spoiled, and used to having her own way. She can also act arrogant and cruel, usually justifying her less-than-admirable actions with her unmatched beauty, causing her to think that she can get away with anything because the world will forgive her (and save for the handful able to resist she is largely successful in this approach, as gleeful suitors of both genders happily forgive her every transgression). She also made it seem that she did not think much of the Kuja tribe either as she commented to Elder Nyon that she did not care if the island was destroyed or not, since everyone would forgive her anyway because she is beautiful. Because of her beauty and strength, she is used to seeing men and women, young and old alike, fall instantly in love with her. As a result of this, people forgive her when she acts cutely apologetic or reminds them of her beauty. However, when Luffy came along and displayed a complete immunity to her charms, she initially felt that she could not bear the existence of someone completely invulnerable to her powers and would collapse dramatically whenever insulted. This feeling has eroded away, though, as she deeply loves Luffy in spite of his immunity to her. Even after the two-year timeskip, Hancock continues to be in love with Luffy as much as before despite that the latter openly rejected a wedding proposal from her. Even though Luffy repeatedly turns down her marriage proposals, Hancock is not discouraged by this and with every rejection she seemingly becomes more determined to marry him. Because of her reputation as the most beautiful woman in the world, Hancock takes pride in both her looks and reputation, flaunting her looks whenever present. She is more than using her looks to force others to do her bidding, be it her enemies or her subjects no matter how she behaves knowing how hopelessly they would fall for her with her charms. She completely justifies all of her actions, no matter how cruel or absurd they are that she will always be forgiven because she is beautiful, which, ironically, has been proven true as up until the abolishment of the Warlord System and was never punished for most of her actions throughout the war at Marineford. Her pride also extends to the reputation and dignity of her Kuja legacy. Because of her past as a slave and being Empress of Amazon Lily, Hancock goes to great lengths to hide her shameful past to her people out of fear of being shunned and forever shaming her people and the Kuja reputation. She takes great effort in ensuring no one sees her or her sisters slave marks on their backs by lying about a \"Gorgon Curse\" and no one spying on her during a bath out of fear of the truth coming out. Even when she first met Luffy, who accidently saw her back, she refused to let him live. She even would prefer to die than let anyone learn of her past as a slave. Like her fellow Kuja, Hancock has no modesty at all, being unashamed showing herself naked to Luffy upon revealing her past and again when they reunite during the Cidre Guild Arc. However, she makes it very serious that she would rather die than ever let anyone see her slave mark on her back, fearing she would only bring shame to her people if they ever learned that their empress was a slave of the World Nobles. It was revealed the reason for Hancock's lies and attitude towards life was that because of her horrible past, she did not want to ever show weakness again to anyone. She harbored a great fear of getting close to anyone, other than her own sisters, and would even go as far to deceive all of the other Kuja. This caused her surrogate mother, Elder Nyon, to fear that Hancock had truly turned as cold as ice. It was not until Hancock confessed everything to Luffy that she finally showed emotion, breaking down in tears after reliving her painful memories. Deep down, Hancock is a rather sensitive and vulnerable woman who is afraid and concerned about how other people (especially the other Kuja) might react to the truth of the shameful past that she and her sisters share. She is also much softer and more compassionate towards others when she opens up. That part of her was only first shown for the first time in several years in front of Monkey D. Luffy and she has not only befriended but more importantly fallen deeply in love with Luffy, even agreeing to venture to the land of her suffering, from her days of a slave, at his request for his brother. Because of her enslavement, Hancock has shown a strong defiance towards any form of capture out of fear of being enslaved again. When the Marines invaded Amazon Lily and Koby tried to offer a peaceful solution at the request she turn herself in alone, she refused to be imprisoned ever again. Even when Blackbeard was choking the life out of her, she still refused to submit to his demands, preferring death over capture. Even after the ordeal was over thanks to Rayleigh's arrival, Hancock was quite vulnerable after the ordeal after dropping her guard, going as far as to rest her head on Rayleigh's leg trying to figure her next move. Her newfound love and loyalty for Luffy has managed to help melt the ice in Hancock's heart and regain the original kindness she had long since buried away. Unlike with her people or her enemies, Hancock acts much kinder and warmer around Luffy, acting like a young girl with a crush. Whenever he is in her presence, she is quick to turn shy, barely able to meet him in the eye and gleaming over every action he takes. Even when he is not nearby, merely thinking of him causes her to blush and truly smile in a way that the other Kuja have said is unusual of her. Amazingly, Hancock is also obeying every of Luffy's orders. While normally calm and level-headed, when angered, Hancock can be highly violent towards those who have wronged her. After falling in love with Luffy, she becomes enraged at the thought anyone harming him. Seeing Smoker nearly kill him, she flew into rage violently kicking him away screaming she had never been this mad in all her life. She also destroyed several Pacifistas in rage for \"ruining\" her moment when she was thinking about Luffy. Since Nyon cleared up the misunderstanding about marriage in general, Hancock is very determined to marry Luffy someday. Even though he turned her proposal down, she still loves him and is not deterred at all. Hancock's love for Luffy is so strong it passed down to her Seraphim, S-Snake, who acts the same way as Hancock around Luffy. This surprised Dr. Vegapunk, since he didn't program her to act like this. Despite the conceit she shows to her enemies and the faade she puts on for her people, she does show genuine care for people close to her. This was seen when she flew into a fit of rage and kicked Smoker away from Luffy after he had tried to kill him. Ignoring the possible consequences of her actions, she openly and publicly declared Luffy to be her beloved, effectively choosing her love over her title (and her people's treaty). During her fury, she showed none of her usual calm arrogance. This is seen again, to a lesser extent, when she screams at Aokiji for stabbing Luffy with an Ice Saber. Her anger is enough to make even Jinbe to cower in fear, albeit slightly and in a comedic manner. She also is very loving and kind towards her younger sisters Sonia and Mary because of the bond they share as sisters ever since they were enslaved by the World Nobles. Even after the two were defeated by Luffy, unlike she did with Marguerite and the others, Hancock showed no ill toward their loss and was gladder they were safe than anything else. She also shows a great deal of affection toward her pet snake Salome. In spite of her cruel behavior towards her fellow Kuja's deep down, Hancock does truly care for them, having joined the Warlords to protect them from outside forces. She even admits to Luffy she constantly lies to them out of shame fearing that she would forever tarnish the reputation of the Kuja's if they learned that their empress was a slave. After she lost her title as a Warlord, coupled with the Blackbeard Pirates and Marines recent attack, Hancock was shown worried that she is not safe on Amazon Lily anymore so long as she stays including she will endanger her sisters, her adoptive mother, and the rest of the Kuja due to the Marines' persistence. Without any choice, Hancock resolved herself to leave Amazon Lily under the protection of Rayleigh and Shakky, one of her predecessors, for her reunion with Monkey D. Luffy in the hopes that her absence from the island would keep it safe from the Marines' persistently attacks. Because of how easy it is for her to manipulate others with her beauty, Hancock can be very selfish, used to having her own way despite being Empress and quite unreasonable towards others, men especially. When Luffy was captured and despite his honest attempts to explain why he was on Amazon Lily, Hancock ignored his requests claiming he was lying to defend himself. However, Hancock is capable of being reasonable to an extent. After her sisters were defeated by Luffy and he again tried to plead with her to unpetrify her subjects, Hancock agreed but only if Luffy chose one of two options: she can unpetrify them on the condition he has to find another way off the island or he can leave the island and they stay that way. She was shocked to see him unhesitantly picking the latter and, after further testing his character, Hancock agreed to help him get off the island regardless. After falling in love with Luffy, Hancock gradually mellows out as a person and as a proper ruler, growing more considerate and mature as a proper ruler for her people and herself. The Marines and the Blackbeard Pirates attack shows her growth as a proper ruler, having gone to the front line to protect her people from further harm, even if it means having to fight Blackbeard herself. Once Blackbeard has her by the throat and most of his crew and Marines petrified, Hancock was willing to return them to normal so long as they and the Marines left the island. Hancock is also fearless and strong-willed, as she is completely unafraid of the consequences of her actions because of her beauty and strength. Even as the Marines surrounded her island and her people panicked, Hancock remained confident with a smile reminding everyone she was a Warlord for her strength for a reason. She was completely unfazed when Blackbeard initially was strangling her, as she absolutely refused to give him even a hint of fear or submissiveness. Her conqueror's spirit was shown when she openly declared she wont bow down to the likes of either the Marines or Blackbeard and welcomed them to kill her before she would ever be another's captive. Due to her suffering as a slave and how the first man she ever saw painfully burned her back with her slave mark, Hancock is very discriminating and judgmental towards men. She refused to listen to Luffy's story about how he was sent to her island or give him any mercy even after Marguerite pleaded on his behalf. When she gave him the option to leave the island or help unpetrify Marguerite and her friends, Hancock believed he would act selfish to save himself and was speechless when he showed his selfless nature. After falling in love with Luffy, Hancock seems to have lessened her judgmental nature towards men as she allowed Law and his crew to dock at the edge of her island and chose to lift her country's law to some extent and permitted Jinbe to wander on the island without watch. This especially qualifies towards anyone affiliated with the government. As due to how the Marines turn a blind eye towards slavery in general despite it being abolished years ago, Hancock unhesitatingly petrified both pirates and Marines during the Marineford War citing to her all men, barring Luffy, are all alike. Because of the horrors she endured from the World Nobles, Hancock became a very bitter and cold woman, caring nothing for others (except her sisters) and usually maintains a tough and aloof demeanor. She maintains this attitude due to her belief she should be strong for her people and out of fear of being taking advantage of again. After falling in love with Luffy, she has become a lot more sympathetic and kinder. She now smiles more often and has started to treat her fellow Kuja's with much more kindness and respect and has even decided to do work with them such as helping them make food for Luffy rather than just order them around as usual. While referring to herself, Hancock uses \"warawa\" (?)an antiquated pronoun that signifies nobilityinstead of the more common \"watashi\" (?). In spite of her arrogant behavior, Hancock has several running gags. The first is that when she looks down on people, she leans backwards so she faces the ceiling (or the sky) above her, apparently looking down on people so much she is looking up. Another is that she appears to dislike small animals, in which she angrily asks who left the animal in front of where she is walking before kicking it away, no matter how cute it is. A Kuja responsibly apologizes, while the offended animal snarls at her, and Hancock advises her to be more careful in the future. She also tends to lose her temper whenever someone tries to keep her from spending time with Luffy, such as when she glared angrily at Jinbe for trying to eat some of the food she made for Luffy and when Rayleigh forbid her from seeing Luffy during his training, which prompted her to angrily pinch his nose. Lastly, she often thinks about Luffy and mistakenly thinks that they are married or engaged and despite (or perhaps because of) repeatedly being told that they are not, Hancock is now very intent on becoming Luffy's wife.", "abilities_and_powers": "Hancock is widely considered to be extremely powerful by friend and foe alike. Ruling beside her sisters, Hancock has power over Amazon Lily and the rest of the Kuja tribe. As the empress and captain of the tribe, Hancock is the strongest Kuja warrior. The Kuja believe that \"strength is beauty\", and since all members of the tribe state that she is the most beautiful in the world, they believe she is immensely powerful, and the strongest among the entire tribe. It is to be noted that only the strongest Kuja warriors are allowed in the country's pirate crew, Hancock and her sisters were strong enough to be there when they were small children, although it is possible, they were just apprentices like Shanks and Buggy. Her strength is so great that it has even been acknowledged by the Fleet Admiral of the time, Sengoku of the Marines. Gloriosa believed that there was little chance for Hancock to die in the Marineford War because of her great strength. Even former Admiral Kuzan commented on her skills, stating she is not to be underestimated. Further testament to her strength is how she was one of the three Warlords who managed to leave the war without sustaining any injuries. The fact that she can earn a 80,000,000 bounty after her first campaign as a pirate further supports her capabilities. Over a decade later, her bounty become 1,659,000,000 following the disbandment of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. This also speaks to her strength considering unlike the other Warlords, she has not been involved with big name events recently. Crocodile, Buggy and Mihawk are a part of Cross Guild which they put bounties on marines' heads. Law and Jinbe were a part of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance which took down the Beasts Pirates and Big Mom. During the Marineford War, she had managed to take down several Pacifistas single handedly without much effort, where it took the whole Straw Hat Pirates (before their two-year training) to take down just one, which left them greatly worn out. During the Marines and the Blackbeard Pirates invasion of Amazon Lily to capture her, Hancock was able to easily defeat most of both invading parties by petrifying them, including Vice Admiral Yamakaji and two of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains, Catarina Devon and Vasco Shot, whom were among the strongest and most dangerous ex-prisoners in Impel Down Level 6. While Blackbeard was able to defeat Hancock thanks to his ability to nullified other Devil Fruit user abilities, he acknowledged she was worthy of being called the Pirate Empress. He further notes he would be in danger of getting petrified by her if he released her and decide killing her was the safer option, despite knowing he would not be able to return his crewmates to normal if he did. Hancock possessed a very powerful willpower when she is unaffected by Luffy's and Rayleigh's Haoshoku Haki. Like Luffy, her willpower is so strong that Hancock refused to submit herself to the likes of her enemies when she refused to Koby's demand of becoming a prisoner to the World Government again (due to her being a former slave of the Celestial Dragons). Even when Blackbeard was initially chocking the life out of her, she also refused to give into his demands and remanded defiant towards him. Hancock has shown to be very sly and crafty when the situation demands it. This was particularly evident when she aided Monkey D. Luffy into discreetly breaking through Impel Down's outer defenses, as well as manipulating the great prison warden, Magellan, to her whims before relaying a secret message to Luffy's brother Ace, whom Luffy was trying to rescue. She has also proven to be a very skilled liar who is excellent at fabricating stories, and her confidence leads her to never consider the consequences of her actions. An example of this is when she takes advantage of her beauty in Impel Down floor 6 to drive the prisoners mad, making them disrespect Magellan and causing enough trouble to speak to Ace freely without anyone noticing. Despite this, Hancock can be somewhat ignorant as she frequently mistakes many of Luffy's actions as romantic. She was able to easily feign a confident demeanor without any hints of trepidation when Vice Admiral Momonga suspected that she was hiding something underneath her cloak. This faade duped him into believing that she was innocent after she gave him permission to search her which he rejected. After being hounded by derogatory and lecherous comments by men and women alike for years, she was unperturbed by the rudeness of the worst criminals of level 6 Impel Down as she delivered her message to Ace. Luffy is the only one whom has continuously shattered her previously thought impervious faade. Once the threats of the Marines and Blackbeard Pirates temporarily passed after the recent invasion on her island, Hancock guessed that she was the sole target, deciding to leave her home to reunite with Luffy and keep focus off the island. Noted as the strongest warrior of the infamous Kuja tribe, Hancock has immense physical strength. She could perform extremely powerful kicks that can easily break stone (in the form of petrified opponents) as well as take down numerous powerful marine officers and New World pirates with incredible ease, and knock away Smoker, an extremely strong and powerful Marine, with a single Haki enhanced kick. Her strength is supplemented with tremendous speed and agility, able to land an extremely fast barrage of powerful kicks on numerous marines and New World pirates at once before they could respond. In Stampede, Hancock had enough physical power to deal a blow to the awakened form of Douglas Bullet, that while left him otherwise unharmed, it was strong enough to be felt. Hancock has displayed a large degree of durability, after being defeated by Blackbeard and chocked by him in the air she remained composed as he prepared to kill her and was able to remain conscious as he tried to strangle her to death. Hancock has extraordinary skills in hand-to-hand combat, supplemented with her Devil Fruit abilities. She easily took down numerous powerful and skilled Marine officers as well as powerful pirates from the New World. Similar to Bonney's and Sanji's fighting styles, Hancock's fighting style seems to personally emphasis on powerful and versatile kicks, which can destroy Pacifistas. Hancock is extremely skilled in the arts of subterfuge and deception, managing to disguise Luffy inside her coat without eliciting much suspicion across an entire boat voyage and inside Impel Down, as well as being the sister to propose spreading the tale of the \"Gorgon curse\" to prevent her subordinates from discovering the humiliating brand of enslavement on their backs over a period of decades. Hancock is also highly intelligent, sly, and crafty when the situation demands it, being able to buy Luffy time, using her charms, after overhearing Magellan's plan to halt his infiltration and managed to manipulate events on Level Six of Impel Down by creating a commotion between the residing prisoners and a \"protective\" Magellan to speak to Portgas D. Ace in private and not attract any attention, as well as stealing the key to Ace's handcuffs for Luffy before his arrival, knowing it would be useful. Hancock is also a master seductress; she could use her beauty and charm to get whatever she wants. With only Luffy as an exception, both men and women have been shown to be susceptible to her charms which therefore allows her to manipulate people as she desires. Though it might be a secondary effect of her Devil Fruit ability, Hancock is incredibly charismatic, to the point where her claims that she is able to get away with anything because she is beautiful has so far been shown to be true, with her antagonistic actions during the Marineford war seemingly unnoticed despite her openly attacking Marines and declaring her love for Luffy. She even convinced Marine officers to give her all their provisions, which they were prepared to happily do. In Impel Down, she used her charms to convince Magellan to take her down to Level 6 in order to buy Luffy more time, and at Level 6, she used her charms once more to cause a ruckus in order to pass a message to Ace. Before the timeskip, Hancock was bad at cooking, but became skilled in cooking meat which is Luffy's favorite dish over the course of two years. Hancock is very adept in long-range combat and is capable of using her Devil Fruit powers to strike her enemies from a long distance. She has shown great accuracy in using Pistol Kiss in which she accurately shot Luffy who jumped from the Kuja Palace from a very far distance. With the Slave Arrow, she shot down multiple New World Pirates at once, petrifying them in the process. During her time as a slave, Hancock and her sisters were force fed Devil Fruits by their Celestial Dragon owners as a form of sick entertainment. Hancock ate the Mero Mero no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her petrify people into stone statues, so long as they feel attraction for her. She can completely turn people to stone by hitting them with any of a variety of heart-shaped long-range attacks, as well as partially transform them by striking them physically, only petrifying the area she struck. Thanks to Hancock's unparalleled beauty and charm, very few people (male and female alike) can resist her powers, allowing her to petrify whole crews with no difficulties. Even extremely powerful people are vulnerable to her power if they find Hancock attractive. She can also return her victims to normal if she chooses by blowing a kiss. Only she can undo the effects of her power, if she dies, the next user of the Mero Mero no Mi would not be able to free her victims. A would-be victim is immune to Hancock's power if they block out their \"dirty thoughts\", such as by feeling strong fear or pain, or if they are simply not attracted to her, such as a blind man not knowing how beautiful she is. Hancock is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. According to Sandersonia and herself, Hancock possesses the ability to use Haoshoku Haki. While she has not yet showcased her usage of it in the manga, Hancock has been seen using it in both Burning Blood and Pirate Warriors 4. Hancock is a highly skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, able to combine her kicks with this type of Haki to bypass a Logia's intangible defenses. Hancock possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki. At the end of the Summit War of Marineford, she was able to detect that Luffy and the Heart Pirates were still alive and had escaped, despite the Admirals' attempts to sink them. Hancock carries with her an extra-large white snake with red marks on its body named Salome, that wears a skull with blue hair jutting out of the back and a constant smile. However, aside from using it as a throne as well as to elevate herself above the battle, changing itself into a spiral shape while doing so, she has yet to use it in actual combat. Salome has the ability to track and sense things on the ocean floor, which was shown when it was able to sense Whitebeard's earthquake before it arrived and when it helped Hancock follow Trafalgar Law's submarine."},

During his time as a bartender, he wore a black and yellow polka-dotted shirt with an apron over it. As a CP9 agent, he wore a black two-piece suit with a white handkerchief in his breast pocket and a sweater undershirt. During his contact with Robin in Water 7 and the attempts to assassinate Iceburg, he wore a checkered pattern cloak with necklaces of beads. Accompanying this costume, he wore two masks. First, he wore a mask with lipstick and markings that go over the eyes and down the cheeks. He then donned a sleepy smiling bear mask after the former was left in the Galley-La Company. In the SBS Volume 44, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Blueno is shown wearing a black and white striped T-shirt and shorts, with a baseball bat in his left hand and a baseball glove in his right hand. It was revealed that when Blueno was younger, he loved baseball. Otherwise, he looked similar to his current age aside from a more youthful appearance, lacking a beard, and had a bandage on the right corner of his forehead. He also seemed less bulky and a little more overweight during his training period around the time of Gol D. Roger's execution, but his limbs were much thinner during the SBS explanation.", "personality": "While undercover for the past 5 years, Blueno presented himself as a friendly and humble bartender, Like the rest of his CP9 unit stationed in Water 7 he ceased this facade revealing his true nature as an emotionless, justice-devoted killing machine. However unlike his other CP9 comrades Kaku, Lucci, Kalifa, Jabra, Fukurou, and Kumadori who are shown taking pleasure in fighting, toying with their opponents, and expressing some eccentric personality traits, Blueno remains calm and collected nearly all the time, implying that this is his natural personality. As a result, Blueno comes to symbolize the cynical, evil actions of the World Governmentnamely using Nico Robin, by blackmailing her through traumas inflicted by the World Government in the first place. He is also a calculating and perceptive man as he was the only CP9 agent who noticed that Spandam's Den Den Mushi was off the hook and guessed that something was amiss in Enies Lobby, causing him to leave the Tower of Justice to investigate and to confront Luffy after his suspicions were proven right. Like the others, he is greatly shocked when a pirate managed to fight on par and even overwhelm him. He has great faith in his own powers and his Rokushiki ability. He also does not believe in things that are not proven to him, as demonstrated when Jabra was scared of other Devil Fruits due to the myth about devils being inside them.", "abilities_and_powers": "Blueno is highly intelligent and cunning, being able to maintain the disguise of a friendly bartender in Water 7 for approximately five years while simultaneously searching for the blueprints of the legendary Pluton vessel in the city, without attracting any suspicion or attention. From intense training in the Rokushiki martial arts, Blueno has incredible superhuman physical strength with a 820 Doriki. He was easily able to overpower all of the Galley-La shipwrights who are highly skilled and powerful fighters. He was able to knock out Tilestone, a very large and strong man in one punch. With a single tug of a whip, Blueno was able to pull three train cars towards him with such force that they slammed together violently. He is extremely agile with sharp reflexes, able to move at extreme speed while using Soru and dodged all of Luffy's punches at point-blank range. As noted by Luffy, Blueno also has extraordinary durability and endurance. With his Tekkai, he destroyed Tilestone's hammer by recoil when it struckhis left arm. He could also withstand Sanji'skicks that can smash steel and monsters with great ease and also all of Luffy's Gear 2 enhanced attacks and later recovered enough to rescue his fellow CP9 agents by himself. After 2 years, Blueno has now grown stronger, as he was reinstated and later promoted to the exclusive CP0, which is considered to be the strongest intelligence organization. Blueno ate the Doa Doa no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create and open doors on any surface, no matter how strong or thick said surface may be. His doors revert back to their original state after some time has passed; in his own words, \"if a door is opened, it must close\". Using his doors, he can easily enter places that are otherwise inaccessible, such as locked rooms. He can also open doors to move freely throughout the entire environment, setting himself up for sneak attacks, as well as open tiny doors that he can use to trap his opponents' feet, rendering his opponents stuck in place. He can even create doors in the air itself, which lead to what seems to be another dimension, allowing him to travel great distances and enter a safe haven where his opponents cannot reach. Blueno is also able to create doors on people and did so to Luffy's face, causing it to spin like a revolving door, making him dizzy. Blueno's Tekkai seems to be the one of the more powerful of the group, and he was the first to reveal any variations of the move. While not a master at the level of Jabra, Blueno understands the physics of Tekkai well enough to develop variants such as \"Rin\" that allow him mobility in conjunction with Tekkai.In addition, he displays a level of tactical prowess, taking his time to determine how to minimize Luffy's increased speed. However, despite this advantage, Luffy was able to use his new Gear 2 abilities to defeat him when they fought in Enies Lobby.Lucci stated that Blueno's bartender job has dulled his senses,but it might just be another show of the arrogance of most of the CP9 unit. Nevertheless, with Luffy only having recently developed his Gear 2 mode around the time when he used it against Blueno for the first time in combat, Blueno has been made memorable as the first adversary to receive the honor of witnessing Gear 2's first activation, as well as the first to be subsequently felled by Luffy while in this state. Bearing a Doriki of 820, Blueno was the fourth most powerful member of the CP9 unit, being just below the top three members, Jabra, Kaku, and Rob Lucci. Blueno possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki."},

However, this was only part of his ploy to use them to load explosives into the Gray Terminal, and then tying them down to leave them to die in the flames after they refused to join his crew. On top of this, his most defining character trait was his wish to become a Noble, for the wealth and the life would grant him. When the king of the Goa Kingdom promised to make him a noble if he would burn down the Gray Terminal and kill its inhabitants, he quickly agreed. This proved to be his downfall, as he was betrayed and left to die with the other inhabitants. Bluejam also believed that on the battlefield the only ones who survived were the strong and cowardly.", "abilities_and_powers": "Bluejam was a well-known pirate in the East Blue, whose feared reputation had been remarked by many characters since his first appearance. He was shown to have a strong will, appearing unaffected by Ace's burst of Haki, while his entire crew fainted. His bounty of 14,300,000 attests that he was considered a significant threat within East Blue, where any bounty over 10,000,000 is noteworthy. Bluejam was seen using a flintlock when shooting Porchemy to death, and also wielded a rifle during the arson of the Gray Terminal. He was later armed with a long, standard pirate sabre, which he seemed quite proficient in wielding, as he was able to draw it and parrying Curly Dadan's attack in mere seconds."},

He also wore a pair of black swim briefs, black knee pads with pink X's on them, wrappings around his ankles, and black shoes. He has a magenta tattoo shaped like a stylized 'S' on his left thigh. As a toy, he appeared as a teddy bear with blue and yellow fur and wearing a purple vest and pants. After the battle in Dressrosa, he wore a high-collared charcoal gray jacket zipped up to his clavicle with an orange star and two yellow stars on the upper sleeve. When the Ideo Pirates intercepted a fight between a longarm and a longleg ships, he wore a gold-colored hoodie.", "personality": "He appears to be a confident fighter with faith in his skills, and because of this he appears to enjoy taunting his opponents. He was also perceptive enough to discover Dagama's attempt to betray him and took the initiative to attack first. Unlike most of the people who were released from Sugar's curse, Blue Gilly is not shown to be swayed by greed as he chose to battle the Donquixote Pirates instead of their enemies, even attacking those who would. Blue Gilly doesn't seem to share the same ill will his tribe has towards those of the Longarm Tribe, not even minding his captain being a member from that tribe. Like his kind, he follows a fashion trend of showing off his long legs.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being from the Longleg Tribe, Blue Gilly focused on training his long legs to fight in Jao Kun Do. He is able to kick his enemies, his legs being comparable to a steel whip and move his legs so fast that it is hard to predict from where his kicks will come. He was able to defeat Ricky, a notable participant in B Block, as well as take out Dagama with a single kick, and was seen unharmed after confronting all of those opponents. It should also be noted that he possesses notable durability as he took a King Punch (which is allegedly powerful enough to turn a fortress into rubble) at point blank range and survived."},

This was the case when Squard stabbed Whitebeard. Though he often maintains composure when things go awry, he shows more emotion when things good happen, as seen when he cheered and pumped his arms when Ace was freed.

She is 8.2 meters tall, being slightly larger than Kaidou himself. Her long blonde hair is styled like a geisha's, with two swords notably being part of its arrangement. Her eyes are sky blue, and a strand of hair tends to dangle in front of her left eye. She has a pair of long, slightly curved red horns atop her head, wears prominent lipstick, and carries a long smoking pipe. She wears a low-cut, black kimono that leaves her right shoulder exposed and a turquoise obi around her waist, both with blue and yellow floral patterns. Her footwear is two black Zri with red Hanao (straps) and white tabi (socks). After taking off her Kimono, she covered her breasts with Sarashi. She has the kanji  (jonan, meaning \"woman trouble\"?) tattooed on her back. In her Zoan form, her spider forelimbs each bear a personalized Jolly Roger, indicating she may have them tattooed on her original body.", "personality": "Black Maria is a flirtatious, courtesan-like figure who takes a laid-back approach to her missions and duties as one of the Tobiroppo. When assigned to fight or hunt for a target, Black Maria instead prefers to stay back from the action and enjoy the company of her captain or play music with her subordinates, taking refuge in safe locations away from all the strife while letting her peers deal with the problems themselves. She also has a soft spot for children, taking pity on Momonosuke after he got brutalized by Kanjuro and tending to his injuries before Orochi took him away. That being said, Black Maria can be just as violent and sadistic as the rest of the Beasts Pirates, if not even more. In stark contrast to her usual playfulness seen during the banquet, Black Maria is a ruthless torturer when actually performing her job as a pirate, not holding back her punches for the sake of the crew's objectives. Even if the victim actually decides to cooperate with her, Black Maria may not honor her word and just keep them trapped under her power. When asked about her methods to keep Robin in line should the Beasts Pirates manage to capture her, Black Maria simply stated that she would mutilate the Straw Hat to the point of helplessness, then kill and discard her corpse after her purpose to read Kaidou's Poneglyphs was fulfilled. Black Maria enjoys keeping captive men as \"pets\" for her to play with (particularly those with rebellious personalities). Through torture methods, she forcefully implants obedience and devotion inside the heads of her victims until they become unable to say anything else but declarations of love and worship towards her, effectively turning herself into their subject of adoration. Black Maria is extremely possessive of those men and will not tolerate any attempts of \"infidelity\" from them, resorting to further violent discipline if necessary. Apparently very vain, Black Maria likes to keep up her look as an attractive courtesan, having modified her own Devil Fruit abilities in order to display a more conventionally beautiful form.", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Tobiroppo, Black Maria holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, with only Kaidou and the All-Stars ranking above her. As the owner of the Pleasure Hall, she oversees the goings-on in it. As one of the six strongest Shinuchi with a 480,000,000 bounty (second highest among the Tobiroppo), Black Maria is very powerful and considered potentially able to challenge an All-Star for his position. She has confidence in her own strength, enough to believe that she could easily kill the Nine Red Scabbards after their loss to Kaidou. When the All-Star Jack cast doubt on her ability to do so, Black Maria felt that she was being underestimated. During her fight against Nico Robin and Brook, Black Maria held the upper hand for most of the fight until Robin manage to catch the Tobiroppo in her \"Demonio Fleur\" and break her back. Befitting her oiran image, Black Maria is a skilled musician, being a capable shamisen player and songstress. Black Maria has shown herself to be a crafty strategist, having collaborated with her subordinates to come up with an ingenious trap to subdue Sanji, one of the Straw Hat Pirates' strongest members, by taking advantage of his obsessive chivalry, having Sarahebi feign being sexually harassed while she used her spider web to trap Sanji. As part of her plan to lure and seize Robin into the Banquet Hall, she had several spider webs set up in the two corridors used to access the room, and a few subordinates armed with tranquilizer guns and placed into strategic positions to further ensure Robin's capture. This was, however, countered by Robin's own ability to bypass obstacles by blooming her own limbs through them and Brook's ice freezing Black Maria's webs solid. Black Maria ate the Kumo Kumo no Mi, Model: Rosamygale Grauvogeli, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transform into a full Rosamygale grauvogelia prehistoric, carnivorous spideras well as into a human-spider hybrid at will. Her hybrid form has a centaur-like body; this is a modified version from her regular hybrid form, which has two legs and 6 arms. Although unconfirmed, it is suggested the alteration in this form might be the result of some drug concocted for this very purpose, similar to the Rumble Ball created by Tony Tony Chopper. She has several spider abilities, including the ability to walk on walls and ceilings with her spider legs, as well as having poison barbs at the ends of her spider legs. She is also able to shoot extremely sticky webs from her body that she can use to trap and bind her opponents, as well as to create a shield of nets. She claims that anyone trapped in them will never be able to get loose. Her webs can even be made into an intricate series of traps, so that no matter where someone steps, they will get captured. Her webs are also very flammable. Black Maria possesses the ability to use Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku Haki. Despite this, she has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on her Devil Fruit and various weapons. Black Maria uses a pair of brass knuckles to pummel immobilized opponents. Once Robin and Brook infiltrated her banquet hall and freed Sanji, Black Maria picked up a polearm, at the end of which was a figure of a wanyudo, a flaming wagon wheel-like demon with a man's face on the side. It is later revealed that Wanyudo is actually a Pug SMILE user who runs on the inside of the wheel to generate flames. Robin noted that Black Maria could potentially burn down the entirety of Kaidou's castle with Wanyudo. Even without the flames, the polearm can be swung with enough destructive power to smash through a wall. Black Maria also has the ability to create illusions using an \"illusion mist\" (, genmu?). When used against Nico Robin, it caused her to hallucinate Black Maria's subordinates as Nico Olvia, Professor Clover and Jaguar D. Saul, though she saw through the trick. It is currently unknown exactly how Black Maria generates and controls the mist."},

Bingo, in particular, was taking advantage of people mourning their deceased relatives by selling them caskets at outrageous prices. Bingo is also a foolish man whose base instincts and passion led him to ruin. The prospect of having a life with the highest-ranking courtesan Komurasaki was enough to get Bingo to sell everything he had, to the point of committing the typically immoral act of selling his family. This consuming passion made him trusting of Komurasaki to a fault, being willing to leave all the money he earned with her without using any legal safeguards. After finding out that Komurasaki had swindled him, Bingo fell into complete despair, leading him to go all the way toward trying to kill the courtesan he was once enamored with to avenge his destitution, and this desire was all he cared about to the point where he did not care if he was killed afterward. Upon his exile, he, along with his two accomplices, were very unhappy being forced to live in the poverty-ridden Ebisu Town, and despite Tonoyasu's kindness to meet their every need, the three continued to make it very difficult.", "abilities_and_powers": "Before Komurasaki swindled him, he was a man rich and influential enough to live in the Flower Capital. Bingo wielded a knife when trying to attack Komurasaki, but is not skilled in wielding it, as he was quickly overpowered by her guard."},

From his fish-man half, he has slippery mudfish skin, sharp teeth, and an orange dorsal fin. From his giant half, he has orange hair and beard, and incredible size. He is however much smaller than a regular giant. He generally wears yellow swim briefs, boots, and gloves together with a Foxy Pirate mask. During Groggy Ring matches, he wears the strap-on ball.", "personality": "Despite his great size, Big Pan is somewhat deaf and a bit slow witted. Like his fellow Groggy Monsters, he laughs at many minor things. During Groggy Ring matches however, Big Pan is a brutal monster that gives his opponents no quarter. Like the rest of the Foxy Pirates, Big Pan is not above cheating and exploiting loopholes.", "abilities_and_powers": "Being born of two races, Big Pan has the abilities of both to a certain degree. From his giant heritage, he has great size and strength. From his fish-man heritage, he has the abilities of an underwater creature, the creature in question being a pond loach, which makes Big Pan's skin extremely slippery and thus resistant to blunt physical attacks. While his skin gives him great defense against most blunt attacks, he is however vulnerable to bladed attacks. While Big Pan is a formidable foe by himself, his greatest strength comes from the great teamwork he has with fellow Groggy Monsters. Together, they are capable of performing seemingly flowing combo attacks that can easily overwhelm any opponent. As a member of the Foxy Pirates, Big Pan as well is not above using underhanded tactics. In the Groggy Ring, whenever the referee \"unfortunately\" looks the other way, he and his fellow Groggy Monsters don illegally concealed weapons. In Big Pan's boots, he has concealed spikes which he can use to crush opponents. Along with these, Big Pan uses an axe and a pair of gigantic pans when the referee is not looking. The latter of these are his most devastating weapons. The attacks he uses in the Groggy Ring are as follows:"},
{"name": "Bell-mère", "episode": "Episode 77", "chapter": "Chapter 32", "year": 1999, "note": "She was first mentioned by Nami in Chapter 50.", "appearance": "Bell-mre was a relatively slim woman with long fuchsia hair tied in a ponytail, grey eyes, and a rather unique hairstyle similar to a mohawk known as a Chelsea hawk (that Oda jokingly named \"Women have guts!\"). She wore a green checkered shirt with the word \"MACE\" on it, indigo trousers and brown sandals. She was also rarely seen without a cigarette. Back in her days as a Marine, she wore the simple uniform with the officer's jacket draped over like a cape.", "personality": "In her youth she was a renowned trouble maker. While her decision to join the Marines shocked all the villagers, they all cared deeply for her welfare despite the trouble that she had always given them. Due to her past, her decision to adopt her daughters led them to fear the children's own welfare. However, Bell-mre was determined to show them that she had grown into a mature adult who was capable of such responsibilities. As a Marine, Bell-mre was quite confident, her reaction to Shiki's escape from Impel Down being to state that she will stop him herself should he attack the East Blue. Her fellow marines note that she is very reliable, indicating she was likely a very effective member of the Marines. Bell-mre retains some of her mischievous nature upon her return to Cocoyasi, offering to pay Genzo for Nami's thefts \"with her body\" (this most likely explaining where Nami got her personality from, as Nami even used the phrase when Genzo captured her, much to his frustration), despite knowing how he reacts. She occasionally acts impulsively, such as when she hits Nami for suggesting that Nojiko is not her real sister, and hits a boy for saying that her mikans taste bad moments after Bell-mre stated to Nami she shouldn't have hit the boy. She admits that Nojiko is sometimes more mature than she is.", "abilities_and_powers": "Bell-mre has fought many pirates throughout her time as marine and gathered enough battle experience to survive. She was perceptive enough to notice that Arlong and his crew were coming for her, despite being distracted by cooking. She also acrobatically managed to pin Arlong on the ground and place a rifle in his mouth, before he or anyone in his crew could react. She wielded a rifle against Arlong with considerably quick maneuvers (possibly taken from her Marine service), though Arlong easily broke it with his Fish-Man strength."},
{"name": "Bepo", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Bepo is a polar bear mink. He wears an orange jumpsuit that bears the Heart Pirates' jolly roger. He also wears small brown boots and has sharp teeth and claws. He is as tall as a normal bear, considerably taller than common humans. In Wano Country, he had a topknot despite having short fur and no hair. He also wore a yukata with the Heart Pirates' jolly roger surrounded by fish.", "personality": "Bepo tends to get depressed easily and apologizes whenever people point out that he is a talking bear. An example of his sensitivity is when Hancock called him a beast and scolded him for attempting to change the subject. His crewmates also scolded him when he wondered aloud whether Amazon Lily had female bears, much to their annoyance. Overall, members of the Heart Pirates accuse Bepo of having a weak will. Ironically, he was able to remain conscious after taking a blast of Haoshoku Haki from Rayleigh, a feat only the exceptionally strong-willed can accomplish. Those who do not know him call him meek. He has been shown to order Jean Bart around (albeit unsuccessfully), seemingly delighted to have seniority over him. At the same time, he does not want Jean Bart to order him around. In the anime, he is shown to dislike hot environments (possibly due to his thick fur and the jumpsuit he wears), as he complained when the Heart Pirates' submarine was near an underwater volcanic region. Much like other male characters when they see a robot, Bepo is able to express admiration towards the General Franky. Sometimes, he can do foolish things like eating a fish from a toxic river.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the navigator of the Heart Pirates, it can be assumed that Bepo has the knowledge required to navigate the seas. The level of his skills is as yet unknown, though it is expected that he is reasonably capable of navigating through the Grand Line. Interestingly enough, despite his occupation, he is not seen wearing a Log Pose, which is essential for Grand Line navigation. He also has some skill in cartography, as he was the one who drew the map of Dressrosa and Green Bit that Law shared with the Straw Hats. However, he appears to be a bit messy, as the map had his paw print on it, and Nami stated that his map-drawing and navigation skills are far from her own. Bepo is fairly strong-willed, being able to withstand a blast of Silvers Rayleigh's Haki. He also has extremely good hearing, being able to detect a sniper and his exact positioning quickly by picking up the moment of fire with his ears. Befitting the animal he is based after, Bepo is an excellent swimmer and can attain great speeds while at sea. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Bepo, like all other minks, is a born warrior. Though he has not yet shown it yet, it can be presumed he is able to use Electro. He is also a skilled martial artist combining his fighting skills with his superior physical abilities as a mink, allowing him to take out several Marines with ease but he is not strong enough to break a Pacifista as when he attempted to kick one, he wounded his leg, similar to Sanji's attack on Bartholomew Kuma. After the timeskip, Bepo's fighting skills and physical prowess significantly improved. In the anime, he could hold his own against the Gifters of the Beast Pirates for twelve consecutive hours before Nekomamushi forced him to retreat. As a member of the Mink Tribe, Bepo is able to awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Bepo's strength, size, speed and fighting abilities are magnified, letting him briefly fight back against even the Emperor Blackbeard and several of his Titanic Captains. Bepo also has access to a special drug developed by Chopper that allows him to transform without the need of looking at the full moon, allowing him to tap into the Sulong's power at any moment."},
{"name": "Bentham", "episode": "Episode 129", "chapter": "Chapter 78", "year": 2000, "note": "He is formally introduced through an infobox in Chapter 154. His full name was revealed by Impel Down guard in Chapter 526.", "appearance": "Bentham is a relatively tall male crossdresser who wears flamboyant ballet clothes with a swan theme. He generally dresses in a pink overcoat and blue medieval garments. He wears heavy makeup, and he often sports a distinct wide grin, which often carries over when he changes his appearance. His legs, being exposed, are hairy. Underneath these clothes, his physique is relatively muscular, as seen during the Impel Down Arc, possibly as a result of his training in Okama Kenpo. Like all Baroque Works agents, he bears his number in his appearance. Mr. 2 Bon Kurei's number 2 is seen in the form of his swans, which are posed into a shape resembling the number \"2\". When he was impersonating Nefertari Cobra, he wore the king's robes and sandals. The back of his overcoat bears the characters for his credo, the Okama Way (?). During Miss Goldenweek's \"Operation: Meet Baroque Works\", he wears a dark suit with a dress shirt covered in 2's underneath with dark pants. Later in the cover story, he wears Mr. 3's attire, which is a dark hoodie with two number 3's on it, striped pants that only extend a little bit past the knee, and light-colored shoes. Later, in Impel Down, he wears a striped, rag-like prisoner's outfit. He also wore Hannyabal's headdress and pants when he was disguised as him. After entering Level 5.5, he wore bandages on his arms, abdomen, and neck, and purple pants that cut off below his knees and black boots. When he let his fellow prisoners escape, he was disguised as Magellan, wearing his coat and pants. Two years later, when he becomes the new Queen of Newkama Land, he is shown wearing a slightly different version of his ballet clothes with some features such as bigger wings and furry collar.", "personality": "Bentham has a flamboyant attitude, which includes singing, dancing, and spinning, much to the annoyance of the other Officer Agents. Despite being an assassin, he prioritizes friendship above all else. He's the only higher up that lacks a female partner of the same rank. Possibly because he believes he is both male and female, probably due to his powers and lifestyle as a self-proclaimed okama, despite never actually wearing women's clothing besides the makeup smeared on his face. He is assigned both a number and a holiday for his code name. As opposed to the ideas of his fellow agents, Mr. 1 and Mr. 5, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei much values friendship as evidenced by his selfless sacrifice to allow the Straw Hats to escape Arabasta when Captain Hina ambushed them. Later, he once again attacked Hina to save Miss Valentine, and finally, he risked his life to open the Gates of Justice for everyone in Impel Down. This also shows that he is incredibly selfless and righteous, and is extremely proud of himself for it (telling Magellan he had no regrets for his sacrifice). He will often motivate such actions by saying that abandoning his companions goes against \"the okama way\". This did not hinder him from attacking Vivi during the face-off at Alubarna, though. He always finishes a sentence with a \"wa yo,\" which in Japanese reflects a feminine (if assertive) speech pattern. He also often says, \"Jodan janai wa yo!\" (, Jdan janai wa yo?, translates as \"It's not a joke!\" or \"Not joking around!\") as his catchphrase. He also says \"Un Deux Trois\" (one, two, three in French) while asking others what four is. According to himself, his favorite word is vague.", "abilities_and_powers": "Before the fall of Baroque Works, Bentham was amongst the top-ranked members of the criminal organization, and presumably had several \"Billions\" (the lower-ranked subordinates of Baroque Works Officer Agents) under his command. As an okama, Bentham has no shortage of tricks in his arsenal. While fond of singing and dancing, he is also an accomplished martial artist, even though his real threat does not come from his fighting ability. His actual threat level comes from his skills in deception and tricking his enemies through his Devil Fruit Powers combined with his acting skills to trick his enemies into doing what he pleases. Despite his flamboyant and fun-loving personality, he has an exceptional prowess in trickery, deception, and mimicry, which makes him a tough opponent to deal with, as he can as easily escape pursuit as well as cause devastating confusion to whatever side he opposes. He managed to infiltrate the seemingly secure Alubarna royal court successfully and mimic Nefertari Cobra, creating further dissension and unrest among the poor villagers outside the capital's walls with scandalous words. He has also used his formidable tactical wits even to bypass the extremely high-security defenses of the notorious Impel Down once he was released from his cell. Bentham has a strong caution for extreme danger, as he thought of many ways he could fight Magellan before correctly deducing its impossibility. Thus choosing to abandon Luffy in his battle with Magellan reluctantly opted to find and use other possible ways to help Luffy in his dangerous mission to break Ace out of Impel Down. Using his Devil Fruit powers, Bentham can disguise himself as an attractive woman. Specifically, Nami, to allow him to gain a psychological advantage in his fight against Sanji and again against Hannyabal. Both of whom are incredibly perverted despite their powerful fighting prowess. In the case of Hannyabal, Bentham was successful in subjugating him using sheer wits instead of direct brute force. He also managed to trick the vigilant Magellan into letting his guard down by disguising himself as Hannyabal and feigning unconsciousness, allowing him to touch Magellan's face up close to copy his visage. This feat is ordinarily impossible due to the lethal nature of Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi. By further posing as Hannyabal, Bentham was able to deceive the entire Impel Down Staff into thinking that he has escaped into Level 3, allowing him to enter Level 5 and search for Ivankov without any detection at all. Ultimately, he helped Luffy and the other prisoners to escape entirely from Impel Down, by tricking the staff by disguising as Magellan to open the Gate of Justice, as well as closing it after Luffy and the others escaped, eluding their pursuers of a fleet of warships. Due to his arduous training in Okama Kenpo, which Bentham described as meticulous, Bentham has incredible superhuman physical prowess. He has an extremely high level of agility, able to easily match Sanji, as well as perform a wide variety of acrobatic flips, twirls, somersaults, and cartwheels, including ballet rotation at high speed for increased momentum to enhance the power of his kicks. His immense acrobatic prowess also makes him extremely evasive, able to swiftly counter or evade fast attacks such as Sanji's kicks or Hannyabal's trident thrusts. He has incredible leg strength, as his kicks are mighty. Quickly knocking out the Sphinx, a giant beast and boss of Level 2. and knock away the Minotaurus, who is an awakened Zoan Devil Fruit user (whom Crocodile noted to be far superior to regular Zoan users). In a combined assault with Buggy, Luffy, and Galdino, Bentham unleashed a spinning kick to its head where the immense force significantly damaged it, causing the Minotaurus to hold its head in intense pain despite his immensely increased endurance. The aftershock of the attack caused the floor underneath its feet to break in pieces. He has an incredibly substantial amount of stamina and endurance, being able to recover quickly enough to escape being captured by the Marines after his fight with Sanji while his fellow officers were arrested. During the battle of Arabasta, he was able to keep up with \"Karoo,\" an animal able to run faster than a leopard (though Karoo was injured at the time) and while in pursuit, he was even able to run up a wall that went straight upwards and had no foothold. While he is confined in the Level 3 prison of Impel Down, Bentham continued to sing and dance energetically, utterly unfazed by the scorching temperatures, a feat that Buggy complimented as it would be impossible for ordinary people to even stand due to the extreme heat. Shortly after reuniting with Luffy, Bentham took a ferocious hit from the Minotaurus's club that caused him to yell in pain and quickly shrugged off the pain to retaliate when Minotaurus attacked Luffy. After Luffy sent the Minotaurus flying, Bentham promptly recovered from the damage he received. While in Level 5, Bentham could continuously drag Luffy in a sleigh for a long while enduring against the immense cold temperatures bare-chested. He also retained sufficient strength to fend off a large Wolf Unit by himself, despite receiving massive injuries in the extreme cold during the fight. Bentham also survived a battle with Magellan, who had previously beaten Luffy with little effort. Bentham ate the Mane Mane no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a physical lookalike of anyone whose face he has touched with his right hand. He transforms himself by touching his own face with his right hand, and changes back to normal by touching his face with his left hand. This ability makes him a perfect master of disguise and deception. He doesnt only duplicate faces, he can memorize and perfectly duplicate the entire physical appearance of his target, including their stature and voice. He is also able to mix and match the features of different faces in his collection, allowing him to create new faces. In battle he uses his power to transform into someone whom his opponent would never do harm to, such as a close friend. However, he has to transform back into his normal self in order to attack, as his fighting style requires a certain level of strength and flexibility that most other people dont possess. Bentham is a compelling martial artist and a master of a unique, dance-based martial arts style known as Okama Kenpo. The art combines forceful and acrobatic kicks and sometimes punches with ballet dancing. His hard training in this fighting style made Bentham powerful enough to kick Mr. 1, an infamous assassin and an extremely proficient hand-to-hand fighter in his own right, through a stone wall during their brief fight, and to be a match for Sanji's Black Leg Style. With Okama Kenpo, Bentham can use a wide array of powerful kicks for offense, as well as acrobatic dance-like maneuvers for evasion. This enables him to easily defeat large numbers of prison officers who were fully armed with trident spears and firearms in Impel Down, knock out a Demon Guard, and briefly hold his own against Hannyabal, the second strongest fighter in Impel Down after Magellan. The two swans on his back are not just for show. Bentham can take them off at the midpoint of their necks and slip them onto his toe shoes. When he has these swans on his feet, Bentham's kicks become as powerful as rifle shots (due to the steel beaks) and gain a farther range (due to the swans' necks extending every time that he kicks). Although used only once, Bentham can detach and throw his (presumably false) mascara Matsuge as sharp boomerangs, which fly out in an arc to attack his enemies and return to his face."},

He is never seen without his rifle nearby or a cigarette in his mouth. His outfit has changed very little over the years since his first appearance; he now wears a black, v-neck shirt with three quarter sleeves (whereas he is previously seen wearing a short-sleeved shirt of a similar color and design) along with loose pants (originally of a dark green color, but presently gray) with numerous pockets on them, tucked inside his buckled boots.

He is a well-deserved vice-captain who silently supports the crew with a deep attitude despite their liveliness. At times, Beckman seems amused at the actions of his captain, such as panicking when Luffy is taken or getting even more drunk when he has already drunk a lot before and when Dracule Mihawk brought the news of Luffy's first bounty.

Beckman is especially known for his advanced intellect, having the highest IQ of any character introduced during the East Blue Saga (above the master strategist Kuro's and Nami's). Beckman has demonstrated some stealth ability when the Red Hair Pirates arrived at Marineford to stop the war, able to climb up and sit on a Marine ship's mast to point his flintlock at nearby Kizaru, a Kenbunshoku Haki user, without the latter noticing until Beckman made his presence known. Beckman possesses impressive physical strength. Twelve years ago, he easily defeated Higuma's crew of mountain bandits using only a cigarette and his rifle as a club. Beckman is also extremely fast, as shown when he climbed up and sat on a Marine ship's mast to intercept Kizaru before he could attack the Polar Tang, despite having just arrived at the scene. Beckman is a skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. He is able to imbue his rifle's bullets with this type of Haki, allowing him to hold a Logia-type Devil Fruit user like Kizaru at gunpoint. Non-canonically, in One Piece Film: Red, Beckman hardened his hands to stop bullets from hitting civilians. Beckman carries a flintlock rifle with him, but he has yet to be seen firing it, instead having used it as a club on Higuma's men twelve years ago, and as a threat against Kizaru."},

During the Jaya Arc, he wore white pants, a green sash with markings, and a pink sleeveless shirt with a navy blue pirate captain's coat over it. The coat tended to fall off whenever Bellamy used his spring-based jumping. He has a scar above his right eye and tattoos of eye-like designs on his arms. He has a trademark grin and sometimes sticks out his tongue in a taunting manner. After the timeskip, he grew in size dramatically. He now wears a pair of black sunglasses and bears two new scars, one across each side of his face, possibly from either his humiliating defeat by Luffy or from Doflamingo's punishment, or both. He has discarded his captain's coat and now wears a short sleeved shirt with his old jolly roger on the back (now painted over with a cross), which is left open to display Doflamingo's mark tattooed on his chest.", "personality": "Before he visited an unnamed sky island, Bellamy was characterized as violent and conceited. He was very arrogant and highly confident in his own powers. He would only attack foes he thought he could win against, and this attitude led to his eventual defeat at Monkey D. Luffy's hands; Bellamy thought he was weak, not knowing that he had recently defeated a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile, and obtained a new bounty of 100,000,000, before moving into Jaya. He loved to have an audience to witness his feats. He was ruthless, as he attacked Roshio over a trivial matter and laughed at other people's misfortune. Like Donquixote Doflamingo, he heavily believed in the \"New Age\" and thought it would soon come after what he calls the \"Age of Dreams\", the current era in which people dream of finding One Piece and becoming the Pirate King. His philosophy of the \"New Age\" led him to taunt and laugh at anyone with such grand dreams as Luffy's; little did Bellamy know that Doflamingo himself aspired to become the Pirate King. Indeed, his cruelty is well known even in the New World, after the timeskip, even though he changed a lot. Bellamy's arrogance tended to heavily influence his opinions of what the world presents before him; this became evident when he dismissed the possibility that there was someone stronger than him during his stay at Jaya when the local drunk presented him and his crew with Luffy and Zoro's new bounties. Like the rest of his crew, Bellamy misinterpreted that a bounty represented a person's fighting level, causing him to believe he was fearsome despite his bounty being only a little higher than average based on Grand Line standards. His crew did nothing to discourage that belief and even went as far as to give him the nickname \"Big-Time Rookie\". As a result, he seemed to consider himself destined for greatness. Bellamy earned his nickname from his trademark grin, constant laughter, and reputation for scavenging riches from other pirates, much like a hyena scavenges its food. He and Sarquiss usually hunted down pirates who were weaker than them, beat them mercilessly, let the rest of the crew \"pick up the trash\", and then robbed them of their treasures while mocking them. After the two-year timeskip, Bellamy has lost much of his arrogance and gained a cold, calm demeanor. He no longer mocks people, as his only ambition was to become Doflamingo's right-hand man. However, he still appears to relish battle, as seen in his fights with Tank Lepanto and with Abdullah and Jeet, wherein the commentator noted his viciousness. In addition, he has become much more observant, as he was able to recognize Luffy through his disguise, and promised not to laugh at him anymore. He also has a strong sense of honor, as he was disgusted by the fact that Tank Lepanto had accepted a bribe, and after the match he told Luffy that by cheering him on he had crushed his pride. More of this reformed personality was shown when he showed reluctance to fulfill Doflamingo's order to kill Luffy. Bellamy was immensely loyal to Doflamingo, a man he had admired and idolized since his youth. He briefly refused to believe that Doflamingo had ordered Dellinger to finish him off in case he failed, and even after realizing it was true, he refused to betray the man he respected. After confronting Doflamingo and being brutally beaten, Bellamy lost his will to live and begged to be killed. Even after Doflamingo told Bellamy just how little he thought of him and forced him to fight Luffy, he did not let go of his loyalty, choosing to attack Luffy even after Doflamingo's control was lifted. Though he realized that his admiration was misplaced and considered himself a fool, Bellamy held on to his principles. Forcing a smile, he claimed that he would keep seeking Doflamingo's approval by taking Luffy down with him but winced when Luffy pointed out that Doflamingo probably knew that Bellamy would try to fight him to the death. After Doflamingo's downfall, Bellamy seemed to forgo his loyalty towards Doflamingo, given Bellamy's newfound friendship with Luffy. Having finally foregone his loyalty to Doflamingo, Bellamy chose to change his ways and quit piracy to find a new life as an apprentice dyer.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to the timeskip, Bellamy appeared to be an average fighter without the aid of his Bane Bane no Mi, upon which he heavily depended. Bellamy easily defeated Shoujou, who had a bounty of 36,000,000, and Roshio, who had a bounty of 42,000,000; both fights were won thanks to his Bane Bane no Mi. However, he had enough talent to receive a bounty of 55,000,000 and also possessed enough talent to be accepted by Doflamingo as his ally. Before becoming a full-time member of the Donquixote Pirates, Bellamy was not a particularly powerful pirate. He usually only enjoyed attacking opponents whose bounties and strength were inferior to his own in order to intimidate others. In addition to being known as \"The Big-Time Rookie\", when his bounty was technically below Grand Line standards. After the timeskip, his overall abilities have improved. After losing to Luffy, he began to improve by surviving Sky Island and returning with a large golden pillar, which he presented to Doflamingo and having attacked many countries that messed with Dressrosa. Furthermore, he was able to survive in the New World, with his bounty rising to 195,000,000, more than triple his first known bounty. All of this gave him a second chance in the Donquixote Pirates. Bellamy was considered one of the favorites to win the final B block, so much so that Dagama advised his allies to defeat him first as he was considered one of the strongest. Despite this, his strength seems considerably inferior to the true officers of the crew, as Doflamingo, once he changed his mind again, sent Dellinger to kill him. Intellectually, he became far more perceptive, as he instantly recognized Luffy through his heavy disguise, a feat most of the other contestants within the room could not manage even when Luffy inadvertently blurted out his identity. He also managed to deduce Bartolomeo's Bari Bari no Mi's weakness after a few of his direct attacks were deflected. He was ultimately knocked out by King Elizabello's \"King Punch\" before he could exploit this weakness, though he regained consciousness soon after the match ended and was seen talking to Luffy. Despite his preference for his spring-based strength, he had enough brute strength to destroy a bar and easily toss a full-grown man clean out of a window. However, he lacked endurance and was knocked out by a single punch from Luffy. When Doflamingo appeared in order to punish the crew for dishonoring his flag, Bellamy was completely powerless to stop him as he forced Sarquiss to attack Bellamy with his human puppeteer abilities. Sometime within the two years after the Summit War of Marineford, Bellamy's strength increased tremendously. He was strong enough to crush the face of a fellow participant with his bare hands. He also managed to take out Abdullah and Jeet simultaneously even though they were dangerous enough to terrorize most of their opponents in B Block. His endurance has also increased exponentially, having taken damage from his fight with Bartolomeo, Elizabello II's King Punch (though he did briefly pass out from this), and Dellinger and Doflamingo's assaults all in the same day before finally falling unconscious from a Busoshoku Haki-hardened Gear Second punch from Luffy. Bellamy ate the Bane Bane no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform his body and limbs into springs. The force created by the compression and release of the springs greatly enhances his offensive power and mobility. Additionally, the boinging noise created by the springs can be utilized to disorient his opponents. He can transform his legs into springs, allowing him to jump with great speed, height, distance, and force. This allows him to launch himself at high speed, allowing him to bounce around the battlefield faster than the eye can see, allowing him to evade enemy attacks and get in close to attack his opponents. His bouncing also gives him high momentum that he can utilize to augment his punches. By transforming his arm into a spring, he can compress his arm and release it at the moment of contact, resulting in a very powerful punch. Bellamy used a knife and pistol to brutalize Roshio. Bellamy also used a pair of knives to stab both Abdullah and Jeet in their feet, pinning them to the ground and immobilizing them, in order to execute further attacks. When Bellamy was controlled by Doflamingo, he wielded a pair of rapier-like swords. During his battle with Luffy in the Dressrosa Royal Palace, Bellamy demonstrated the ability to use Busoshoku Haki to harden his fist. By combining this with the force gained from Spring Hopper, Bellamy was able to punch Luffy with enough power to break through the latter's own Haki-hardened abs, causing him to cough up blood. Bellamy possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki.During the B Block fight, Bellamy was able to sense the incoming strength of Elizabello II's King Punch despite having his back turned to him. After the B Block fight, Bellamy used this ability once more to measure's Luffy own strength and Haki."},

He wears a gray metal mask with fourteen (ten in the anime before the timeskip) eye-holes and two long, curved bull horns; his face has never been fully exposed. His long orange hair falls to the front of his chest and the rest of his hair can be seen going down his back. As with many high-ranking officers, he wears a double-breasted suit with a blue shirt and black tie, and a military overcoat he wears draped over his shoulders with chains hanging from the lapels. In his youth, his hair was much shorter. He also wore a different mask with smaller horns and only twelve eye-holes as opposed to the more imposing one he now uses. Bastille's first present-day mask was destroyed after Sabo used Ryusoken to initially crack it, then plucked it from Bastille's face upon defeating him and crushed it in a display of power before other Marines. He replaced it with a similar mask that had a different pair of horns which are more angular and have ridges.", "personality": "As a Marine, he likely holds a strong belief in justice.

He also proved to be quite cunning, as he quickly realized that someone had taken control of the eastern port of Dressrosa after asking his caller via slug for his name and registration number to verify that he really was a Marine.

Also he has the potential to be called upon to be one of five vice admirals leading a fleet of ten battleships during a Buster Call.

Despite the heavy weight of the weapon, thanks to his superhuman strength he is able to handle it with great ease, even with one hand. Although Sabo destroyed it very easily. While confronting Franky at the Toy House in the anime, Bastille was shown using a Flying Slash Attack against him, although the cyborg easily blocked it. Then, before he was defeated by Sabo, Bastille attempted to strike him, and his sword swings alone easily sliced through nearby buildings. Like all vice admirals, Bastille is capable of using Haki.

{"name": "Bartholomew Kuma", "episode": "Episode 233", "chapter": "Chapter 151", "year": 2002, "note": "", "appearance": "Kuma is an enormous man, being 689cm tall. He is the second tallest of the former Warlords (being three centimeters shorter than Gecko Moria) and is usually seen carrying a Bible. He has a pair of round, bear-like ears that protrude from the top of his head. His eyes are strangely covered by clear-mirrored lenses; while initially, he will give the impression of wearing glasses, it seems that, based on the Pacifista that were destroyed, that his own eyes were actually replaced by cybernetic ones. Several decades ago, when Bonney was a young child, his eyes and ears were normal, and he wore eyeglasses. His white hat and the dark blue fabric of his pants are covered in brown spots. His jacket contains a large white design reminiscent of a target crosshair or a coda sign. There are also several white paw prints lining the bottom hem of his coat. He also has a long protruding chin. He bears the tattoo \"PX-0\" on the left side of the base of his throat, after the final touches were done on him becoming a complete cyborg before the Summit War of Marineford. In the anime, Kuma's hair and jacket are black, and his hat is gray with black paw-like prints. In the manga, Oda originally intended for Kuma to have a completely different color scheme. Kuma's hair was shown to be brown, his jacket bright orange, and his hat yellow with green spots. Later on the cover of Chapter 532, his coat was changed from orange to blue, though the rest of his design remained untouched. Later still, on Volume 90, Kuma's hair was changed to black, matching his depiction in the anime. In Unlimited Cruise, Kuma's jacket is brown. After the timeskip, Kuma's cybernetic armor has become heavily damaged, with a few weapons jutting out of his body, fruit of his mission to protect the Thousand Sunny from attackers for two years. Due to his subsequent enslaving at Mary Geoise, he now wears rags similar to the ones Jean Bart once wore when he was a slave, a collar and chain around his neck, has even more swords jutting out of his body as result of the World Nobles inflicting damage onto him for their own amusement, one of his cybernetic eyes is missing and he no longer holds his signature Bible. After he was freed from slavery, he went back to his original clothes and had all the swords removed from his body and it appears that his cybernetics have been repaired. Like all slaves of the World Nobles, Kuma has the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon burned into him[citation needed], marking him forever as \"less than human\". In SBS Volume 63, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Kuma had short hair and was missing his bear ears, glasses, and cybernetic enhancements he receives later on. He wore tattered clothing and wooden sandals carrying a heavy load of chopped firewood on his back while reading a book called \"Ninokin\".", "personality": "Kuma is an enigmatic man who is apparently famous for his fury and cruelty. Calm and composed, Kuma generally does not speak much unless absolutely necessary and maintains a stoic, robotic disposition at all times. When talking, Kuma customarily uses the word \"target\" in his sentences. He also tends to ask a person where they would like to go on a holiday before sending them away with his Devil Fruit ability, often honoring the recipient's request, but will occasionally send them to a place of his own choosing regardless of whether or not he received a reply. In spite of his epithet implying a violent personality, Kuma was said to be a gentle man (according to Sabo) whose kindness earned him great respect from his fellow Revolutionaries. Likewise, Kuma was a very loving father to his only daughter, Bonney. Indeed, Bonney vouched that her father's reputation as an evil tyrant was falsely advertised by the Government and that he is in fact a very kind individual. This is further reinforced during the latter portion of the Thriller Bark Arc, where Kuma displays honor and respect towards Roronoa Zoro for putting his own life on the line for his captain's safety, an act that impressed the Warlord enough to give the swordsman a chance to save his own crew, in spite of that conflicting with the mission he was assigned. There are still several mysteries behind Kuma's character. The details behind his transformation into a \"Pacifista\" and what exactly it entails are still unknown. His past as a king and as a child have also been hinted to be quite tragic and horrifying, with Kuma in particular feeling embarassed about the idea of others delving too deep into his private memories. Although he obeys the commands of the World Government, Kuma disagrees with what his superiors deem \"good\" and \"evil\" in the world. He even goes so far as to speculate that Blackbeard's acceptance into the Warlord ranks had been a very poor decision by the government, despite the fact that it filled the position left by Crocodile's defeat. However, Kuma's loyalty does not extend to the Marines. This can be seen when he declines to answer a direct question from Admiral Kizaru during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc. Due to his refusal to assist the Marines without a direct order, Kuma did not hesitate to lie when it came to his victory over the Straw Hat Pirates at Sabaody Archipelago. Despite being perceived as the most dutiful of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Kuma was never really loyal to the World Government's cause, and was in fact acting as a double agent. Kuma was shown to be a brilliant agent of deception, managing to successfully manipulate the World Government from discovering his true affiliation towards the Revolutionary Army for several years. It is also heavily implied that Luffy being the son of his superior, Monkey D. Dragon, was the main reason for Kuma's continued assistance of the Straw Hat Pirates. At present, however, Kuma's modifications have been completed. In the finalization of the Pacifista project, Kuma eventually lost his free will, personality and memory to the modifications, in order to ensure his reliability and continuing services towards the World Government. In this stage, Kuma shares the same mindless intelligence of his fellow Pacifista models, only recognizing individuals as either enemies or allies to the World Government. Doflamingo refers to the original personality as being \"dead\", though it was later revealed that Kuma and Dr. Vegapunk (the man responsible for his cybernetic implants) made a secret deal to allow for Kuma to have a temporary relapse by rendering his final \"free thought\" as defending the Thousand Sunny. After that, Kuma was relegated to working as a slave-to-rent and obeying the demands of the World Nobles without question.", "abilities_and_powers": "Prior to his final Pacifista modifications, Kuma was an officer in the Revolutionary Army. As a result, he had control over its lower ranking members. However, he lost this power when he became a complete slave of the World Government. As the former king of the Sorbet Kingdom, he once held political power. Kuma was shown to be brilliant at deception, managing to successfully trick the World Government about his true affiliation with the Revolutionary Army for several years, as well as being elected to the position of one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Kuma is one of the few people to have completely defeated the Straw Hat Pirates and is also the only character introduced so far that has defeated the crew single-handedly, twice. However, the crew was extremely weak and injured both times and they were in no shape to fight another battle, much less a Warlord (in the first encounter, the crew had just finished battling another Warlord of the Sea, Gecko Moria, as well as an island full of zombies and a giant zombie named Oars; in the second encounter, they had just battled against a Pacifista while fending off a second, alongside Sentomaru and Marine Admiral Kizaru). He did not want the crew dead, however, since he allowed them to escape, indicating he might have held back. He is extremely fast, enough to seem as though he has disappeared in the eyes of the Straw Hats, as well everyone on Thriller Bark. This is, however, unclear if it has something to do with the modifications from Dr. Vegapunk, or if it is part of his Devil Fruit powers, or simply his raw speed. He has such a fierce reputation that even other powerful and famous pirates are unnerved by him, as seen when the captain of the Kid Pirates, Eustass Kid, seemed heavily disturbed when he witnessed the arrival of a Pacifista (mistaking it for the real Kuma) on the Sabaody Archipelago, despite the fact that his bounty was higher than Kuma's former one. Through his actions, he appears to have great knowledge in geography, as with his powers he knows exactly where he is sending someone seemingly no matter where in the world he is. His degree of knowledge is high enough to perfectly locate even a moving sky island, although his cyborg modifications may have enhanced this ability. This is also shown when he asks people where they would like to go before he \"pushes\" them. Kuma ate the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gave him paw pads on the palms of his hands; these paw pads have the power to repel anything they come into contact with. His paw pads grant him an absolute defense that allows him to protect himself from all physical attacks, even swords. This ability, coupled with his vast reaction speed, allows him to repel attacks from extremely quick opponents, such as Luffy in Gear 2. He can also use his paws to attack by repelling his target at great speed. By Kuma's own admission, his paw pads repel things at the speed of light. His palm strikes are able to deal significant damage to his enemies, due his repelling power subjecting his target to a severe level of force. Additionally, his power to repel is not just strong, it is also focused into a cannon-like blast, enough to create a deep hole through thick stone. His paw strikes can also travel beyond the target, dealing identical damage to anything behind them as well. Kuma can repel the air itself, attacking his opponent with a cannon-like shockwave. He can also compress an immense amount of air between his hands into a single small bubble, and then release the air bubble, which explodes as a super-massive shockwave that can decimate an entire island. Interestingly, he can repel all the pain, injury, and exhaustion out of a person's body, allowing him to completely heal people in an instant, even if they have suffered an incredibly severe level of damage. Once the pain is expelled from the person's body, it takes the form of a paw shaped bubble, the greater damage that was removed, the larger the bubble will be. The damage can be transferred into another person's body, causing them a great deal of suffering all at once. Possibly the most impressive application of this fruit is that Kuma can send someone flying over vast distances, even across the world and traveling over the course of several days. The victim of this ability is encased in a paw bubble that protects them from and breaks through any obstacles that are in the way of the destination of Kuma's choosing. To an outside observer, the victim appears to vanish. Kuma is now a cyborg modified by Vegapunk. He is, however, very different from other cyborgs, and displays strength and agility that are on a different scale. As with the other Pacifista models, Kuma has a built-in electronic recognition device within his pupils, which enables him to accurately identify certain individuals (presumably anybody that is listed within the World Government's bounty system) and their bounty count from across a distance of several dozen meters. Kuma's massive build along with his cybernetic enhancements grants him tremendous durability and strength comparable if not superior to other Pacifista; the average Pacifista model is capable of withstanding a combination assault from the pre-timeskip Monster Trio. At Thriller Bark, he effortlessly lifted a large slab of rubble with a single hand and his body was resilient enough to withstand most physical attacks, including Sanji's \"Concasser\" (in fact, Sanji injured his leg after delivering the blow, despite it being strong enough to stun a user of Tekkai) and even Zoro's \"Shishi Sonson\", a technique that was able to cut through steel, which only left a scratch on Kuma despite it being a surprise attack. Emporio Ivankov's \"Galaxy Wink\" appeared to inflict no substantial damage upon Kuma, despite the barrage of attacks being powerful enough to knock him off his feet. Even after two years of accumulated damage, lack of repair, and lack of sustenance intake, Kuma was still operational. While the modifications gave Kuma great strength, their full completion over a long time period apparently robbed Kuma of his free will. Due to technically having his mind removed, Kuma does not feel any pain. While being enslaved by the World Nobles, Kuma was constantly and brutally abused by the World Nobles without feeling any discomfort, not even reacting as Rosward struck his head hard with a hammer and stabbed him with a sword. He has multiple swords stabbed inside his body and continues to function without succumbing to the accumulated damage. As a Pacifista, Kuma has the ability to shoot laser beams, which not only causes massive explosions upon detonation, but can also melt steel. This laser is apparently a replication of Kizaru's Pika Pika no Mi powers and for Kuma, this launcher is only installed in his mouth. In the other Pacifista, the launcher is installed on their palms as well. Kuma has his paw pads instead of the laser holes on his hands; it is this aspect, along with the bible that only he holds, even after losing his free will, that distinguishes him from the other Pacifista, and makes him superior to them. However, he seems to possess gloves that allow him to shoot lasers from his palms, as he was about to demonstrate during Charlos's second attempt to kidnap Shirahoshi."},

His overall attitude and lack of refinement made him a very unpopular person among the audience, who booed Bartolomeo at every turn. During his formal introduction, Bartolomeo is said to be ranked number one on the \"pirate we wish most to disappear\" list. He is also very provocative, as Bartolomeo not only taunts the crowd with his shenanigans, but also mocks his opponents, usually in a nonchalant manner. Even when attempting to stay cool, however, Bartolomeo can become angered when provoked in return; when the spectators at the stadium insulted and threw junk at him, he in turn threw a fake bomb at the audience to scare them. Bartolomeo also does not care what anyone else thinks of him, bluntly having stated to Dagama that popularity among an audience of jackasses is the least of his concerns. He did not even mind that he made enemies with the Donquixote Pirates by saving Bellamy, even treating it with blissful indifference. He also loves to mock his opponents as he pretends to be afraid when Hack was going to attack him only to reveal his Devil Fruit to make Hack's attack back fire on him. As his own phrasing states, Bartolomeo also does not seem to hold a high opinion of people, practically denouncing them as when he voiced his disgust by the crowd's reaction when he threw the fake bomb into the stands, seeing them step over, push and trample one another to escape. He can be bold and daring, even towards one of the Four Emperors, as shown when he burned the Red Hair Pirates' Jolly Roger (unaware of their connection to Luffy). However, Bartolomeo seems to care for his crew, as he violently beat up Vice Admiral Maynard for what he did to Gambia. That aside, it is this particular course of violence that has made him infamous, as he was noted to have gunned down several innocent civilians in the past. Despite such a destructive nature, he can restrain his murderous rage to a certain extent, at least by the regulations set by the Corrida Colosseum. While he is very laid-back, he is not immune to expressing shock as such when he heard that Luffy is around. Despite the cruelty he shows to others, he has immense respect for the Straw Hat Pirates. After witnessing Luffy's miraculous survival on the execution stand in Loguetown two years ago, Bartolomeo became a massive fan of Luffy's and views him as his hero, even to the point of worshipping him. After following Luffy's exploits up until the Summit War of Marineford, he was inspired to start his life of piracy. His respect for Luffy is so deep that he gets angry and attacks people who mock Luffy, as seen when he squashed a man against a wall with his Devil Fruit powers and even cuts the man's tongue right after he badmouthed Luffy. Bartolomeo also expressed shyness towards Luffy as he hesitated to speak to him face to face. Bartolomeo has been shown to get easily excited when he sees the people he idolizes as when he saw Zoro, he burst into tears out of joy. He weeps uncontrollably even when doing something as simple as asking Zoro for an autograph. When he came face to face with Luffy, he screamed in joy. It has been revealed that he only entered the tournament in order to win the Mera Mera no Mi and give it to Luffy. Bartolomeo has been shown to have some honor, as he saved Bellamy from being brutally killed by Dellinger. Even though he and Bellamy fought against each other in the tournament, Bartolomeo stated that those who fought together are friends and he would not let a friend die without helping. Bartolomeo has a distinct speech style, ending his sentences with \"-dabe\", a copula originating from northeast Japan dialects and typically associated with the country bumpkin stereotype. Like many others, he has a unique laugh: \"Hehehahahaha\".", "abilities_and_powers": "As a pirate captain and former mafia boss, with 150 towns under him, he likely has great skill as a leader. Bartolomeo is a Supernova, meaning that the Marines consider him to be a serious threat despite being a rookie pirate. He is shown to be strong enough to easily defeat Vice Admiral Maynard, and was able to win the B Block of the Corrida Colosseum tournament without getting so much as a scratch (though he was actually laying on the sidelines watching while avoiding conflict until he was forced to use his barriers). Bartolomeo faced Gladius, one of the officers of the Donquixote Pirates, with Cavendish in a two-on-one match and then in a singles match; although on both occasions he was more focused on protecting Robin, he managed to defeat him with a single decisive blow. Bartolomeo is tenacious with a great amount of durability, as shown when he took a by two explosions by Gladius' attack and got up quickly both times. Bartolomeo is also physically extremely strong and skilled in hand to hand combat. In the anime, he is shown to have taught himself to use Luffy's fighting style, which he adapted into his own barrier enhanced version in lieu of his idol's own abilities. By encasing his fist in a small hard barrier similar to a boxing glove, Bartolomeo could punch with extreme force, able to knock Gladius out in one hit. Even without his Devil Fruit abilities, Bartolomeo could easily defeat Hack, an exceptionally strong fish-man with a vicious kick to the face. Bartolomeo ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows him to create a protective barrier by crossing his fingers. His barriers are seemingly indestructible, as attacks from powerful individuals such as Bellamy, Dellinger, Gladius and Hakuba had no effect; even Elizabello II's \"King Punch\", which can demolish an entire fortress, could not damage the barrier. Bartolomeo can only sustain one barrier at a time. His barriers are far from being restricted to defense, as he can utilize them in various versatile ways. The shield can also be used for offensive purposes by launching it forward, pushing his enemy away or crushing them between the barrier and some other structure on the enemys opposite side. Another offensive utilization is that he can surround his fist with a barrier, strengthening his punch. Bartolomeo can also morph the shape of his barrier into solid constructs, such as stairs which people can stand on, making this fruit useful for getting to hard-to-reach places. Bartolomeo carries a dagger with him, though he has only been seen using it twice. Once when he cut off the tongue of a Corrida Colosseum contestant who insulted Luffy, and the second time was when he tried to kill Gladius in an attempt to save Nico Robin. He is also shown to carry around fake bombs that can be used as a scare tactic, like the one he threw at the audience in the Corrida Colosseum. It is unknown if he has access to real explosives, although certain games give him the ability."},

Instead, he dresses in a regal attire, consisting of a long, white and dark brown patterned fur coat and light-purple necklaces. He has many cat-like characteristics: his eyes are slit like a cat's and his cyan hair is a wild mane, with white horns attached to his head via black metal plates underneath. His mustache is a lighter blue than the rest of his hair, very large and droopy, sticking out about the same length as his shoulders; they resemble a cat's whiskers, fitting in with his feline-like appearance. He also has no eyebrows. Since his debut, his arms so far have always been somewhat obscured, but it can be seen at one point that he has black vambraces with a spiral design; in the anime, it was revealed that he was wearing black and dark bronze metallic gloves. He is also revealed that some of his upper teeth are missing from his jaw. He is also about the same size and width as others amongst his new crew like Blackbeard. After the timeskip, he has the beard finished in three points and wears an elaborate crown with the Blackbeard Pirates' Jolly Roger. ", "personality": "In most of his appearances, he is usually seen smiling, even when attacking Whitebeard. He also seems somewhat nostalgic about things and has a tendency to say \"Nya\" at the end of his sentences, the Japanese equivalent of \"Meow\". He also has quite a desire to become leader, as he was daring enough to ask (albeit in a joking manner) Teach to let him be the captain instead. He also seems to be cool-headed and react to most situations with a casual attitude as he showed no signs of concern or anger when Moria and his zombies were rampaging on Hachinosu, only commenting that they were noisy while eating and asking questions to his men about Moria. Despite his lack of concern when Moria attacked Hachinosu, he is shown to not want to attract the ire of Teach, as he did not want himself, nor Vasco Shot or Sanjuan Wolf to go after escaped prisoners due to the damage it could cause. During his time as a king, he was corrupt and selfish, using royal privileges for his self-serving purposes that led to his people impeaching him.", "abilities_and_powers": "Pizarro's abilities have not yet been fully defined, but he was powerful enough to be contained in Level 6 of Impel Down when caught by the World Government. Another testament to his power is the fact that, when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he only chose the ones that could survive when pitted against everyone else in a free-for-all battle. Thus, Pizarro is one of the strongest Level 6 prisoners. As a king of a North Blue country, he had authority over his people, though his abuse of it led to them overthrowing him, stripping him of such privileges. After becoming captain of the Fourth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, he gained the authority associated with the status. Pizarro has superhuman durability, as seen when he took a direct hit from a Gura Gura no Mi strike from former Emperor Edward Newgate, having taken a direct hit from Sengoku's shock wave bursts in Daibutsu form and remaining mostly untroubled by the attack. Pizarro ate the Shima Shima no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to assimilate his body into an island itself. Once assimilated, he can control both the natural environment and any artificial structures. While merged with an island, he can feel human activity on it, as if something were tickling a corresponding part of his body. He can also make his face manifest across the island, in sizes and on surfaces of his choosing. In the manga he used unknown weapons, due to his arms being always obscured by something.

He is not sympathetic to the prisoners and will often blow off their actions as insignificant due to the immense power he and his subordinates hold over them. He takes running the prison quite seriously, but he can also be slightly dim-witted, as he did not pay much mind to Luffy's attempted escape and he and his subordinates had to be spurred into action by Queen. However, he can also be more reasonable and level-headed than his superior as he tried to remind Queen of how dangerous it is to get between Big Mom and her food after Queen insulted and threatened her and later ordered his men to not shoot at Big Mom, knowing that it would only anger her. The elephant growing out of his body seems to like bananas, casually eating some while his master was giving out orders.

So far, it seems he only answers to his general, Kaidou, and the All-Stars, namely Queen. Babanuki is extremely resilient as he survived the detonation of a bomb that was stuck inside his elephant's trunk. Babanuki ate an Elephant SMILE (SMILE, Z no Sumairu?), which caused an elephant's head to grow out of his chest. Unlike some other SMILE users, Babanuki appears to have full control over his elephant head, having been seen speaking through it. However, it can still act independently at times. The elephant head is capable of unleashing powerful explosive blasts of air out of its trunk. However, the trunk can be tied, which prevents the sneeze from being discharged; it will backfire on Babanuki, causing him grievous injuries. He possesses a weapon called \"Excite Shot\", which is said to be 200 times more deadly than the Mummy virus from the Excite Bullet.

He is tremendously strong, able to wield a baseball bat that weighs 4-tons with no effort and his bat swings can destroy bricks from long distances from the shockwaves alone. However, he is also extremely slow in nature and would not succeed without Miss Merry Christmas handling the \"intelligence\". His slow tendencies only apply to his intellect and casual walking speed though, as he is able to travel in Miss Merry Christmas' tunnels at tremendous speed and hit several baseballs at once. Crocodile has noted that he and his partner are actually stronger in terms of physical power than the Mr. 3 team, but are a lower rank because Mr. 3 is smarter and more tactical. In spite of his generally low intelligence, Mr. 4 is apparently smart enough to calculate the exact time at which each of his baseball bombs will go off, allowing him to know exactly when to direct them at his intended target. Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have great teamwork during battle, with Mr. 4 being capable of using Miss Merry Christmas' hole network to surprise the enemy and Miss Merry Christmas can restrain the enemy or even bring him closer to Mr. 4 so he can directly strike the enemy with his bat. Babe has a dog called Lassoo, which was originally a gun, but \"ate\" the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund, a Devil Fruit, and became a gun-dog. Lassoo shoots timed exploding baseballs that weigh as much as cannonballs, even when he sneezes (when he's first introduced, he has a cold). Mr. 4 then takes out his 4-ton baseball bat and hits the balls at his enemies, launching them at great velocity and accuracy at different angles.

She has been seen smoking a cigarette on multiple occasions and sometimes carries heavy weapons on her back, including a large rifle, an axe, and a sword. She has long black hair, which she wears slightly curled and adorned with a white lace headband. When she arrived at Punk Hazard, she wore goggles around her eyes, which started filling up with tears when she cried. Upon her arrival at Punk Hazard, she was seen carrying new weapons on her back: a large bazooka and a large Gatling gun.

She seems delighted at the notion that she is needed whenever she is asked to do something, even if the person made it clear that it was a mere joke right afterward, to the point of committing suicide to achieve it. This behavior can make her want to marry, help, lend money to, or buy things from anybody who asks. She is known to even buy weapons from someone, despite their uselessness to her in particular, while naively believing the salesman in that the owner of the weapons would be blessed with happiness. As a result, she has a debt of 98,000,000 and eight late fiancs. Her nave nature was highlighted in her battle with Sai, as she mistook his words as flirtations and even offered to be of use to him, despite him being an enemy of her crew.

Outside of her desire to be needed, Baby 5 is an incredibly emotional person, once losing control and attacking Donquixote Doflamingo, her superior, for murdering her fiance. She has repeatedly gotten angry at Law, only to cry and seek comfort from Buffalo moments later when he glares at her. During her childhood, Baby 5 was something of a prankster, playing tricks on the ever-clumsy Corazon and getting a chuckle at the officer's expense, such as delivering scalding tea to him that burnt his tongue, despite being struck across the face in return.

She also appears to have a decent level of durability as shown when she was shot with a pistol, only to appear completely unharmed afterwards. She was durable enough to withstand the attacks from General Franky and Nami's homing lightning bolt, taking only a short time to recover. She has the strength to carry several heavy weapons larger than herself as well as superior jumping abilities, as shown when she jumped off of Buffalo in midair to allow him to blow away the lethal gas weapon, landing safely on his back when he was done. Baby 5 ate the Buki Buki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to transform her entire body, or select parts of her body, into any kind of weapon she desires, including a giant sword, a sickle, a pistol, a rifle, a cannon, or even a missile. If her body is broken into pieces by the intended effect of the weapon she transforms into, such as if she blows apart as a bomb, then her body will reform.

Alongside the versatile range of weapons she can produce from her own body, in all of which she shows great proficiency, she carries on her back what appears to be a Gatling gun and a large flamethrower, as well as a sword strapped to her thigh. She showed great skills in using the Gatling gun, having aimed at the General Franky from a distance, with the rounds causing quite some accumulative impact, despite the robot's durability blocking any damage. She bought these on a whim due to her personality flaw and the salesman's sweet talk, despite the fact that, as noted by Buffalo, she is a weapon herself and does not need them.

{"name": "Atmos", "episode": "Episode 553", "chapter": "Chapter 461", "year": 2009, "note": "", "appearance": "Atmos is a huge man, roughly the size of Jozu, whose choice of clothing he somehow mirrors: he is dressed in sleeveless gray and golden armor, and wears an old-fashioned Asian-themed gray helmet that has bull horns sticking out of it, that makes him resemble a water buffalo, as per his epithet. He has long, mane-like black hair, reaching down to his waist, and his beard is just as long. He has two teeth resembling those of a walrus, but square-shaped and pointing upwards. On each of his arms, he bears a purple tattooed silhouette of Whitebeard's Jolly Roger.", "personality": "Atmos is very loyal to Whitebeard, as he is willing to risk his life to save Ace from his execution. He cares deeply for his crewmates and captain, as he cried and expressed significant grief when Ace and Whitebeard were killed. Atmos is rather bold, confronting the Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo by himself, but he quickly admits when he is in over his head, nervously warning his crewmates after Doflamingo began manipulating him to hurt them.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the commander of the 13th division of Whitebeard's crew, Atmos has command and responsibility over the pirates within his division. He is a very experienced veteran, as he was shown as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger. He seems to be quite well famous, as Doflamingo knew who he was when the two encountered each other on the battlefield. Atmos carries around two large swords and can deal devastating blows with them, as seen when he attacked and destroyed the swords of some of his crewmates while Doflamingo controlled him.

{"name": "Basil Hawkins", "episode": "Episode 498", "chapter": "Chapter 392", "year": 2008, "note": "", "appearance": "Hawkins is a tall man, with black triangle symbols on his eyebrows, red eyes, and golden hair that reaches down to his hips. He also has a black cross patte tattooed at the base of his throat. His attire includes a pure white coat with a ruffled neckline and sleeves. He also wears purple trousers tucked inside black boots with white laces on them and a dark ornament made of fur circling the lower part of his torso, with a lighter shade in the middle of it. He also has a pink sash tied around his waist, with a piece of jewelry hanging from it. Hawkins also wears dark gloves similar to those worn by Blueno of CP9, and an armor-like armlet can be seen on his left arm around his left biceps, which also extends to cover his left shoulder. On his right hip he carries a sword with an elaborate pommel that resembles a voodoo doll. In SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Hawkins is shown with much shorter hair and wore a similar shirt to the one he wore before the timeskip but in pink. He wore light and dark green striped pants. He is also shown with his trademark stoic expression, possibly partaking in a tarot card reading. After the timeskip, he changed the white cloak to a dark blue, green and black checkered pattern, reminiscent of a Scottish kilt, a pink sash on an orange, on which hangs the same ornament. Also, he wears the same black fur belt, but already with blue ornament instead of red, the same black and purple armor, but at the same time stopped wearing gloves. In addition, his hair and skin became lighter. During the Wano Country Arc, he wore a long black cape (white in the manga), a dark shirt (white in the anime) with a ruffled collar low enough to show his tattoo, a brown glove on his left hand (Hawkins wore two brown gloves when he was in Rasetsu District), purple trousers with a checkered pattern with ruffles from the hems, a cream-colored cravat fastened by a dark cross patte-shaped pendant, and brown boots. He also wore a black and red violet armor-like armlet. During the raid on Onigashima, he fought against Killer and had his left arm sliced off.", "personality": "Hawkins portrays himself in a noble and enigmatic manner. He almost always remains completely calm regardless of the situation, showing no emotional response to events that would be considered outrageous to most people. Even when approached by a powerful enemy like a Marine Admiral, Hawkins rarely falters from his usual composure while considering his options for the situation at hand. He is not entirely unemotional though, but in the rare occasion he expresses anything more than general aloofness, it tends to be brief and downplayed. So far, Hawkins has exhibited visible shock, unease, and even sadism at certain points. Hawkins is an extremely serious, no-nonsense individual, claiming to dislike jokes, not being bothered by nudity, and having little tolerance for unruly behavior. He almost dismissed joining forces with the Kid Pirates and On Air Pirates for this reason, as he thought those crew's respective captainsEustass Kid and Scratchmen Apoowere not respecting his time due to constant infighting. Thanks to this seriousness, Hawkins holds a logical, pragmatic mindset when it comes to confrontations, even admitting in his fight against Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro that he is not above fighting unfairly in order to subjugate a worthy foe, like his fellow members of the Worst Generation. This is facilitated by his Devil Fruit abilities, which allow him to take other people's lives hostage and utilize these as bargaining chips. Still, Hawkins can demonstrate honor and release hostage lives if his goals or demands are met. Hawkins has the habit of foretelling the fate of those around him, sometimes remarking on it regardless of its significance (ranging from death to one's clothes getting stained). In fact, he spends most of his time reading and analyzing his tarot cards, which appear to be his main tools for fortune-telling. Hawkins has the utmost confidence in his cartomancy, using it to calculate the probabilities of certain outcomes happening and determine a course of action to follow. Joining the Beasts Pirates, for example, was a result of that, as any other alternative had a zero percent chance of survival according to him. Hawkins often accompanies his fortune insights with vague, ominous-sounding statements like \"seeing the shadow of death upon one's future\", doing so either to reassure others or as a threat towards an opponent. Hawkins prefers avoiding needless violence and commotion as much as possible, even apologizing in behalf of his crewmates in order to not make a scene. He is a quick thinker and can make lies on the spot in order to prevent a disaster in the process. On the other hand, Hawkins is a cruel and ruthless fighter who is not against slaughtering whole crews in his way. He has little regard for the lives of the people represented through his Straw Men, letting them endure lethal damage meant for himself without regret or concern.", "abilities_and_powers": "As Captain of the Hawkins Pirates, Basil has complete authority over the crew. And as a member of the Worst Generation, the World Government recognized him as a fearsome Pirate who, with his crew managed to survive the first half of the Grand Line and enter the New World. He dealt crippling injuries to the Brownbeard Pirates, and their Captain, Chadros Higelyges, all but ending their career as Pirates. After the timeskip, his bounty of 249,000,000 was raised to 320,000,000, the fifth highest among the Supernovas, being the same as Jewelry Bonney. Hawkins' strength and abilities have shown to match his reputation, becoming one of the Beast Pirates' Shinuchi. He is among the few people who could deal faint wounds on Zoro, someone who hasn't received wounds since the timeskip; however, Zoro was protecting Luffy and an ailing Tama, after his Staw Man's Card targeted them, but proved incapable of doing much against the Pirate Hunter. As a Shinuchi, he holds a high position in the Beasts Pirates, has authority over lower-ranking members, and is one of the top authorities in Bakura Town along with Holed'em and Speed. Hawkins often speaks like a fortune teller and has been noted to mention reading \"signs\". He can use tarot cards to apparently assist him in determining the outcome of any event, as well as the likelihood of his own success. This proves to be very helpful in many situations, as it allows him to determine the outcome of a battle and act accordingly. His cards allow him to work out to a percentage of the chances of something happening. His predictions seem to be accurate quite often, as he was able to predict that he and his crew as well as the other Supernovas, would not perish at the hands of Kizaru. He also predicted that Luffy had a chance of surviving his injuries sustained in the war. It is yet to be explained how he is able to do this. He was wrong about his prediction concerning Brownbeard's fate though, as Hawkins said he saw the shadow of death in Brownbeard's face. Brownbeard however, survived. It is possible though that Hawkins was simply trying to scare Brownbeard. It is also possible he said this to mean that Brownbeard would come close to death (which he did) or be surrounded by his dead crewmates. Hawkins is frequently shown using a deck of tarot cards for his predictions. He originally used blue cards with a dark gray border and a yellow four-pointed star in the middle over a dark blue burst. After the timeskip, his cards are red with a yellow border and a dark red star over a black burst. In the anime, he went back to using blue cards during the Wano Country Arc. Before the timeskip, he would attach them to straw capable of housing a card on each stalk. After the timeskip, he is somehow capable of making his cards levitate in the air while he reads them. The anime shows him still using the straw at first before correcting this later. In the anime, starting in the Wano Country Arc, the cards seem to glow either bluish white or pinkish purple when he uses them. The artwork of the cards, as shown during the Wano Country Arc, is similar to the RiderWaite designs, only with the people depicted as skeletons. The Death card, however, have a unique design, different from the real world deck. Hawkins also uses his cards in combat by drawing them and whatever effect they have on them. However, doing so is a double-edged sword, with the results as likely to be detrimental to him and his forces as being beneficial to them. He claims that the more risk he bears, he will have a greater chance of being granted a good card. The effects of a card can change depending on whether it is drawn reversed or not. During the fight, Hawkins will use the affects alternatively between the two sides. The card effects revealed are: Upon being defeated by Killer, Hawkins' deck scattered around him a few of the cards were visible. Based on the cards similarity to the RiderWaite depiction, the cards seen were: Hawkins ate the Wara Wara no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create and manipulate straw. He can cover himself in straw-armor, create straw weapons, and make a large scarecrow-like straw effigy to aid his offense. These creations also gain nail-based weapons. By using his straw to create straw voodoo dolls, he is able to transfer any physical damage inflicted upon him to another person whom the respective doll is connected to, leaving him unharmed but forcing his victim to take the damage that he would have. However, only so much damage can be passed to his victim. While the exact amount is unknown, once enough damage is dealt, the doll will be shed from his body with the wound visible on it, unable to be used again. Hawkins is a rather tactical and pragmatic Captain, compared to the others among the Worst Generation, most known for committing some of the boldest and dangerous actions. His most infamous and cold-hearted tactic relies on the creation of Straw Dolls, who would be linked to several people, using them as substitutes to take the damage and life-threatening injuries, almost giving him the appearance of being untouchable. Hawkins see situations from the practical side, often aided through his fortune telling, not seeing the point in standing against the Four Emperors, such as Kaidou and Big Mom. In facing Law and Killer, Hawkins planned ahead of time, making Straw Dolls linked to Penguin, Shachi, Bepo, and Eustass Kid ahead of time to gain some leverage against them. However, such strategies failed against Law and Killer, the former intended on taking the three out alongside Hawkins, whereas the latter figured out a major loophole behind the Straw Dolls. Hawkins has great skill in swordsmanship supplemented with his Devil Fruit powers. He wields a sword created out of the straws produced by his power, allowing him to form a flexible yet sharp whip-like single-edged blade. He used it to pierce a lizard that was thrown at his direction, stopping the creature from crashing into him. Hawkins can also use the pommel as a medium to produce his \"Straw Man's Card\" puppet, and to guide the puppet's movements. Hawkins possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki, During his first encounter with Trafalgar Law, Hawkins sensed his strength before their confrontation and judged Law to be \"powerful\" despite not knowing his identity at the time due to the latter's disguise. Hawkins possesses the ability to use Busoshoku Haki. The Warabide Sword is a long, thin double-bladed longsword. The main feature of the Warabide Sword is that its composition is made of straw with the power of Hawkins' Devil Fruit, the Wara Wara no Mi."},

{"name": "Ashura Doji", "episode": "Episode 920", "chapter": "Chapter 910", "year": 2018, "note": "He was first mentioned as \"Shutenmaru\" by Holed'em in Chapter 916.", "appearance": "Ashura Doji was a very large man with light pink puffy hair that was gathered into a topknot. He wore an open kimono with flowers on it that left his chest exposed. He had floral tattoos on his arms and upper chest.", "personality": "Ashura was once an extremely violent and dangerous outlaw. He claimed that he hated people with a higher status than him. After being defeated by Kozuki Oden, who chose to spare his life and offered him a chance to live a peaceful life by rebuilding Kuri, Ashura became one of his most loyal followers out of immense gratitude. He and the other Nine Red Scabbards attempted to steal money from Shimotsuki Yasuie to support Oden. Ashura was even willing to study hard to improve himself on Oden's behalf. Ashura was an extremely loyal person, as he referred to Oden as \"Oden-sama\" even after his death. His dedication was also seen when he patiently tried to assemble an army of samurai to support the Kozuki Family and continued to believe in Toki's prophecy ten years after her death. He was also courageous and almost fearless. When he encountered Jack in Okobore Town, the then ruler of Kuri and one of the Beasts Pirates' All-Stars, the former was not afraid to attack the latter immediately and did not even fear Jack's reputation. However, he was cautious of Kaidou's strength, but he would have fought back against him if only to create an opening for his escape. Ashura was also a very caring person. When the samurai he had gathered tried to attack Kaidou at Onigashima, he cried and tried to stop them, but his words were in vain because they did not listen. After losing the last of his comrades, Ashura finally lost hope and returned to being a criminal under the alias Shutenmaru and formed a group of thieves because he was disillusioned and nihilistic towards the state of the country. After returning to being a criminal, he became an aggressive and prideful person. He stole from both Wano's wealthiest and poorest citizens for the same self-sufficiency motives. He also did not care what would happen to his country due to the lack of strong and noble people like Oden. As such, Ashura was disgusted with Luffy's heroism in feeding the citizens of Okobore Town. He also initially refused to rejoin the Kozuki Family after they returned for their campaign to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, accusing them of abandoning Wano Country. Ironically, his cynicism was what prevent him from falling into Kanjuros scheme into believing the fake Oden even though he wished it was him. Despite his callous behavior and nihilism towards the citizens of Wano, Ashura still had some compassion, as he secretly felt sympathy towards the citizens of Ebisu Town, who had lost the ability to express sadness and anger from eating the SMILEs that Orochi manipulated them into eating. He was also distraught when Yasuie was executed, showing that he still cared greatly for those that were his comrades. After deciding to rejoin the Nine Red Scabbards, Ashura became friendly with his comrades again, though he still bickered with them from time to time. He ultimately chose to sacrifice himself to prevent Kanjuro's explosives from killing the other Scabbards. Ashura was one of the few samurai known to still use Sunacchi, which was once part of the old dialect of Kuri in Wano Country. Ashura and his men used it frequently amongst themselves and in battle. Ashura seemed to enjoy drinking alcohol. In the past, he also drank blood from a decapitated snake.", "abilities_and_powers": "As the leader of the Mt. Atama Thieves, Ashura Doji had complete authority over the group. He had excellent leadership skills, as he successfully led his bandits on missions to raid Orochi's Paradise Farm multiple times, though his group eventually came under suspicion. 25 years ago, while Oden was away with the Whitebeard Pirates, Ashura assumed control of the yakuza in Kuri as the new yakuza boss, and kept both the yakuza and bandits in the region from going out of control. Combat-wise, Ashura was a mighty samurai, once feared as the \"Strongest Monster of Kuri\" (, Kuri Saiky no Kaibutsu?)the most dangerous villain frequenting said region during its era of chaosuntil he was defeated by Oden four decades ago (the latter taking a whole night to take down both Ashura and his then-cohorts). Even more, in the last 20 years, Ashura claims to have become stronger. Kin'emon hailed Ashura as one of the strongest Scabbards (alongside Kawamatsu and Denjiro) and worth 100 men in battle. Kaidou himself, an Emperor, sought to recruit him and Holed'em, a Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, surmised that Monkey D. Luffy must have been Ashura's subordinate going by his power. Perhaps most impressively, Ashura was able to fight evenly against the All-Star Jack, a top henchman of Kaidou with a bounty of 1,000,000,000, even dealing him a severe wound, and fought evenly with Inuarashi, one of the two strongest warriors of the Mink Tribe, in a sparring match. However, Ashura was well aware that he had no chance against Kaidou by himself, preferring to retreat when faced with him a second time. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his dragon form. Ashura was capable of applying tremendous physical power to his swordsmanship, as he matched Inuarashi and Jack in strength, even giving the latter a massive wound across his chest. Alongside his fellow Scabbards, Ashura managed to push Kaidou off his feet when ambushing him. Even after being brutally defeated by Kaidou, he retained enough strength to tackle Kanjuro's drawing of Oden through a wall. Despite his large build, Ashura was extremely fast, as shown when he charged toward Jack in an instant. Ashura had great endurance and a tolerance for pain, as he was seemingly unaffected when Jack cut him on the shoulder and survived being stabbed in the back by King. Similarly, he quickly recovered after being impaled by Kanjuro's drawing and exhibited no discomfort as he was stabbed multiple times. Ashura was a highly skilled and powerful swordsman. With one slash, he gave Jack a large cut across his chest and broke one of his shotel blades. He then proceeded to fight evenly with the pirate in what spectators considered to be a high-level duel. He was capable of emulating Oden's signature Oden Two Sword Style style, allowing him to wield two swords at the same time and perform one of his techniques. Ashura was a master of Busoshoku Haki, known as \"Ryuo\" in Wano. He could harden his swords and also possessed an advanced level of this Haki, as shown when he cut through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin. Ashura possessed the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki."},
{"name": "Alvida", "episode": "Episode 2", "chapter": "Chapter 1", "year": 1997, "note": "", "appearance": "Originally, Alvida was a tall and very obese woman with long wavy black hair and freckles on her cheeks. She wore a white cowgirl hat with a large red plume, a red neckerchief, a pink plaid shirt, and a blue captain's coat over it with the arms in the sleeves, unlike many other pirates. She wore rings on her fingers and her long sharp fingernails had red polish. She had a purple sash with a flintlock pistol tucked in it and some jewels. She also wore graying pants and red shoes with gold buckles. After eating a Devil Fruit, Alvida has transformed by shedding the excess weight from her body. The Sube Sube no Mi makes Alvida very slippery and, aside from the cowboy hat she wears, Alvida looks totally different from her original form, being slim, well-endowed, with dark-green eyes (before brown), while maintaining her original hair. She still has her cowboy hat, but she now dresses in a pearl necklace, a bikini top, and tight Capri-length pants. She sometimes has a purple coat draped over her shoulders. She wore a pair of sandals (shoes later in the Post-War Saga in the anime), and now tends to wear shoes that can slip off easily so she can use her Sube Sube Spur technique with the slippery soles of her feet. She still wears lipstick, polish on her now shorter fingernails, and her toenails are shown painted as well (something that before was not visible before due to her shoes). During her appearance in Loguetown, she also had a cape-like, pink cloak with red hearts on it. Most people that see her actually fall in love with her (as seen in Loguetown, even women), similar to Boa Hancock. Delusional (or, most likely, in denial) about her former appearance, Alvida comments that theonly changeshe experienced after eating the Devil Fruit was simply that it \"made her freckles disappear\". After the timeskip, she replaced her cowboy hat with a red-and-white top hat, and capri pink pants.", "personality": "She sees herself as the most beautiful lady in all of the sea, even when she had a much more rotund and neglected appearance. If someone would disagree, she wouldsmash the offender with her iron mace. She does not like noise and dirty things, nor does she take to risking her life against overwhelming odds. She can be foreboding to men, especially subordinates, and is not afraid to put her foot down firmly on things that go against her interests. When pushed, she can be cruel above all else. Disliking filth and laziness, her crew was forced to clean the entire deck of her ship. If there is even a hint of dust, she wouldsmash thatpersonwith her club. Before she found and ate the Sube Sube no Mi, people used to say that she was the most beautiful woman in the world just to avoid getting hit by her iron club. After she ate her Devil Fruit, their comments became genuine thanks to her new beauty, even though Boa Hancock and the Mermaid Princess have also been called the most beautiful women in the world. After eating the Devil Fruit, she also underwent a personality change. She speaks in much softer tones and is somewhat less prone to hitting her crew with her iron mace, despite the fact that her men (and any other men) are too distracted by her appearance to care when they are hit by her mace.", "abilities_and_powers": "Initially, Alvida was only mildly formidable by East Blue standards. Though large and strong enough to captain her own crew and earn a minor bounty, she was quickly outfought and knocked unconscious by Luffy. She successfully landed only one blow, which was rendered completely ineffective by Luffy's rubber body and the angling of the spikes on her mace. Her intellect was also unremarkable and easily overtaken by her temper and vanity. Following her defeat by Luffy, she became noticeably more resourceful and judicious. With apparently no extrinsic help, she was able to navigate the East Blue and secure an alliance with Buggy, her coolheaded prudence counterbalancing his easily-excited crewmen. Alvida ate the Sube Sube no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that makes her skin smooth and slippery, granting her the ability to make any physical attack harmlessly slide off her body, be it from weapons, hand to hand combat, or even large, heavy chunks of rubble. This power also allows her to \"skate\" along level surfaces on her bare feet, though she apparently requires a ramp to build up initial momentum. In addition, this power caused all the body fat to slide off of her, drastically changing her physique, eliminating her previous bulk, and giving her a perfect hourglass figure, making her beautiful enough to charm whole crowds of men on sight. This new physique has apparently not affected any of her physical prowess, as she is still strong enough to wield her Iron Mace with ease. Alvida's trademark weapon is a heavy, spiked Iron Mace (, Kanab?, \"Iron Club\" in the English versions), which can easily maim or kill an ordinary man in one swing. She can also throw it with enough accuracy - at least from short distances - to shatter an entire wooden shack. Even after becoming slim, Alvida continues to wield the iron mace just as effectively as before, capable of knocking out several marines in a single swing and showing no exertion from the effort. In addition to the mace, she also carries at least one flintlock pistol at all times and was skilled enough to drive off a giant crab with one shot."},

He now wears a thick hoop earring in each ear, a more elaborately designed vest, and he drapes a light colored captain's coat over his shoulders.", "personality": "Aladine appears to be rather calm and level-headed. As a former slave, he is able to understand the kind of trauma that a freed slave goes through.

He was also able to treat Mjosgard's injuries after he came to Fish-man Island. Later, as the first mate of the Sun Pirates, his authority within the crew is second only to the captain's, Jinbe. This means that he assumes command of the crew if Jinbe is not present. As a merman, he is a fast swimmer and can breathe underwater. As a former soldier, Aladine also has immense strength befitting his size, having been able to lift a barrel as large as himself over his head with a single hand. Aladine, like many other fish-man warriors, is a practitioner of Fish-man Karate and seems to be very proficient with it. He managed to clash with Charlotte Oven, one of the executives of the Big Mom Pirates, by using Umidaiko. In the anime, he is able to use Uchimizu as well. In the anime, Aladine is also capable of using Fish-Man Jujutsu to perform Kairyu Ipponzeoi to prevent Daifuku's genie from sinking the Thousand Sunny. Aladine wields a trident holstered behind him."},

Albion appears to be among the many others who were easily fooled by Fake Straw Hats' charade. Still, his desire to have his name known throughout the seas may have contributed to his decision to join Demaro Black's crew, as he did not question the dubious credibility of the fake Straw Hats. He quickly became angered upon realizing that his \"boss\" was a fake weakling, accusing the latter of taking advantage of the real Luffy, whom everyone thought to be dead, all the while considering Black to be a \"random piece of trash worth a mere 26 million\". As Sentomaru put it, Albion and the rest of the recruits were stupid for being so easily duped by the frauds.", "abilities_and_powers": "Not much is known about his abilities.

{"name": "Absalom", "episode": "Episode 444", "chapter": "Chapter 339", "year": 2007, "note": "", "appearance": "Absalom was a richly dressed man who wore an ankle-length coat that had a high collar and is cut like a parapet along the bottom, a white button-down shirt with two stylized crosses on it, basic blue slacks tucked into his boots, a white belt with a chain, and basic black boots with criss-crossing straps on the front of them. He wore a round white hat with a blue mark and had the muzzle of a lion stitched to his face, as well as long blond hair. Underneath his garments was a body stitched together from various animal parts. Absalom's skin was that of an elephant, and his muscles were a mixture of bear and gorilla. The combined weight of these transplants, along with his body, gave Absalom a total weight of 300 kilograms. These transplants on Absalom's body were all performed by Hogback. As a child, Absalom was visibly emaciated and malnourished, and wore a moth-eaten top hat with a light-colored mark on it over his short hair. He wore only dark pants with a string of beads on the side and simple shoes and carried around a shovel.", "personality": "Absalom was a well-known pervert; tellingly, the zombies in the graveyard nickname him \"Erosalom\" due to his highly amorous nature, despite him being their leader. He did not shy from the idea of sexual harassment and assault. Absalom sought women to be his bride, among other things, and particularly liked weak women who cannot fight back, such as Nami. He licked Nico Robin and spied on Nami while she was naked and taking a bath, in addition to holding her against her will; later attempting to kidnap her when she, Usopp, and Tony Tony Chopper were running away from Perona's animal zombies, successfully kidnapping her as she fled from Oars and the Mysterious Four, and forcing her to become his bride. All these perverted tendencies made him very similar to Sanji; they even react similarly to Nami's beauty while she was dressed in a wedding gown by mistaking her for a divine being. However, he was absolutely terrified of Lola because of her attraction to him, and is unwilling to marry a zombie. In addition, he is quite hypocritical about his perversion, having called Sanji a pervert for wanting his Devil Fruit powers in order to spy on women. When faced with matters not concerning his potential bride, Absalom exhibited a reasonably dedicated persona and is much more serious than Hogback and Perona. Like the other members of the Mysterious Four, he was devoted to Moria's ambition, though he often had to work very hard as his minion due to Moria's tendency to slack off and overall irresponsible behavior. Absalom's dream was to become the \"Graveyard King\" and rule over all of the graveyards in the world. Absalom often referred himself in plural in lines such as \"You will be our bride.\"", "abilities_and_powers": "As one of the Mysterious Four, Absalom had been given authority by Moria to control the zombies of Thriller Bark. In his case, he had the Soldier Zombies and General Zombies under his command prior to the fall of Thriller Bark. Though this did not necessarily mean that he was more powerful than any one of the Generals, it meant that Absalom still posed a significant threat to enemies of Thriller Bark due to his undead subordinates. His overall power is great enough that even zombies not under his direct command will obey him out of fear of his wrath. Dr. Hogback has augmented Absalom's body with animal parts like the skin of an elephant, the jaws of a lion, and muscles that are a mixture of a bear's and a gorilla's. This gives him superhuman strength, demonstrated by how he constantly carries around a bazooka on each arm without showing signs of duress. He also restrained Nami and lifted her off the ground with one arm without displaying any visible effort, leading Nami to note his strength as well. Due to Hogback's modifications to his body, Absalom is also notably durable, having withstood an electrical attack from Nami with minor injuries while mistaking it for the sensation of love. According to Absalom, Sanji's kicks must be exceptionally powerful in order to actually injure him. He also possesses remarkable endurance, as he managed to get up and kidnap Nami even after being brutalized by multiple powerful kicks from Sanji, only being definitively knocked unconscious by a powerful electrical attack from Nami shortly afterward. Absalom ate the Suke Suke no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which gave him the ability to turn himself, as well as anything he touched, invisible. He most notably used its powers to spy on women. After the timeskip, Absalom began using his powers to help him in his work as a freelance reporter, such as spying on the Kid, On Air, and Hawkins Alliance. Absalom has two arm-mounted bazookas that he makes invisible with his powers, making it seem like he is performing an energy blast of sorts. They appear to be triggered by his movements, as he was seen raising his wrists when firing them. Absalom also had a dagger which he used as a final blow in an attempt to kill Sanji."}
